<meta property="og:description" content="The book cover presents a vibrant scene reminiscent of a classic role-playing game. A charming, red-roofed building, likely an inn or shop, sits atop a floating island with a pathway leading down to a lower level. Several characters, including a young woman with red attire, populate the scene. Red triangles with exclamation points hover above the characters, suggesting alerts or warnings within the game&rsquo;s context. In the bottom left corner, a red goblin icon with the text &ldquo;x3&rdquo; indicates a potential threat or enemy encounter." />

<p>The book cover presents a vibrant scene reminiscent of a classic role-playing game. A charming, red-roofed building, likely an inn or shop, sits atop a floating island with a pathway leading down to a lower level. Several characters, including a young woman with red attire, populate the scene. Red triangles with exclamation points hover above the characters, suggesting alerts or warnings within the game&rsquo;s context. In the bottom left corner, a red goblin icon with the text &ldquo;x3&rdquo; indicates a potential threat or enemy encounter. The name &ldquo;Don&rdquo; is emblazoned across the top in large, bold, red letters with a black outline, signifying the protagonist or a key character in the story. The overall style evokes a sense of adventure and lighthearted fantasy, inviting the reader to explore the world within.</p>

<p>Book Description:</p>
<p>This story follows the powerful troll Don as she establishes a new settlement called Dontown and builds up a community of goblins, warriors, and soldiers. As a level 15 warlock, Don faces various challenges in managing resources, fending off attacks, and leveling up her community members, all while navigating complex relationships with human adventurers, fishmen public servants, and other factions. The story blends fantasy, RPG mechanics, and kingdom-building as Don works to expand her influence and create a safe haven for her people, while also uncovering darker forces that aim to undermine her efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Skip the prologues and head over to chapter 1 if you want to get right into the main story. The prologue just delves more deeply into Don&rsquo;s perspective, so it is very fragmented and non-linear, characterized by non-standard use of words and unusual phrasing, and highly poetic and abstract.</strong></p>

<p>Author&rsquo;s Note</p>
<p><strong>Skip the prologues and head over to chapter 1 if you want to get right into the main story. The prologue just delves more deeply into Don&rsquo;s perspective, so it is very fragmented and non-linear, characterized by non-standard use of words and unusual phrasing, and highly poetic and abstract.</strong></p>
<p>This prologue leans toward a more fragmented, non-linear, and ambiguous style. It&rsquo;s meant to provide vignettes and out-of-context scenes that will be explained in the main story. Though, prologue (1) to (3) is generally more linear in terms of writing style. The entire prologue may be skipped, since it will mostly be extra content rather than essential context. As for whether this prologue occurs before or after the main story, considering that the main cast is here, it occurs before the main story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To start, a young troll, Don, squeezed in a boat, as she curled her lips inward and scratched her lower back.</p>
<p>Moving on to a more abstract and figurative note, wood cracked into Don’s ears and sang a lullaby that turned her into a sullying quadruple; every rock of the boat syrupped her into a seething blaze of coarse flame and damning incarnation. The sky would tether them into the inevitable, trifling seat of the river’s bed.</p>
<p>Anyway, Don said: “What’s with the small golem back there?”</p>
<p>She rubbed her chin. “Is it operational or something?”</p>
<p>When it came to context, Don was a troll from a far land, and she was coming here to help a man named &ldquo;Sam.&rdquo; Moreover, she brought two young goblins, whom she had taken under her care. As for her role, being a troll, she was a powerful creature, and Sam, a hybrid between man and fish—a <em>fishman</em>—wanted her help in a coming fight. In conclusion, she was headed to the camp where Sam and his soldiers were, and the fight was about to begin.</p>
<p>Returning to the moment, she played with a weighty, disproportionate, mechanical toy the size of her hand. The rubbing of her lips, like a grimace, fled into raised brows and a blown raspberry.</p>
<p>Dancing yet again into a more metaphorical and abstract tone, the night sky elated her like a molten skee across a dance of tulips organized in a heap. Her soul became uninhabited, dull like a stopped refrain.</p>
<p>To explain these abstractions, despite her seemingly dull and emotionally hampered demeanor, Don had a very vivid inner life, her internal complexities sundering each other and creating vast works of imaginitive artistry.</p>
<p>Bouncing back to the common level, a part fell from the toy Don held, dropping the ground, and the two goblins with her—Ritand and Bata—bent down to pick it up. All three of them were on the same boat.</p>
<p>Regarding their subjective experience altogether, shining white lights blinded them, their moods in suspense at the edge of precipices and unresolved like tritone.</p>
<p>Moving on to one excluding Don; Ritand and Bata imagined themselves like bats soaring and swooning after the birth of a crisp, elegant smile on Don’s face.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, when they bent down and their boat rocked, they dropped the pocketed necklaces.</p>
<p>They gasped and scrambled to return it.</p>
<p>In the end, the night sky demanded their careful obedience to the endless abandon, time and place fifteen years in the past.</p>
<p>Heading into a new phase, Don helped pick up the necklaces on the floor of the boat, smoothing out her sleeves and bending over.</p>
<p>Stretching focus to a larger view, their boat touched land between massifs between a deep valley on one of many white beaches. Faraway, rock outcrops, pinnacles, and cave systems made up this karst region.</p>
<p>Falling back to the in-person perspective, after they crossed the beach, Don tsk-tsked, crouched, and grabbed a torch on the way into a tent.</p>
<p>Playing with a mystical vibe, Sam, a fishman, stood deep inside the tent, staring at the ground, fidgeting with his decorative gills. Second, a cup of bitter coffee dripped down his mouth and mustache: he drank anyhow. Lastly, he shook when he saw Don.</p>
<p>Heightening the mystical aspect, in his head, Sam danced with the fairies as they pointed to his plan for the stone wall Don. Second, he twisted his torso and curled his head, his stomach lightening at the appearance of even an inch of the magnificent troll. Finally, the Arabica coffee by his side softened his gills and made the shadowed light like a soothing, sooting embrace.</p>
<p>Bringing the mystical quality to the everyday level, Sam pointed to his engraved wand containing mana crystal shards. “Pretty heavy.” His voice shook somewhat halfway.</p>
<p>Zooming to Don&rsquo;s side of things, having only entered the cave, she flicked her finger against the toy in her clasped hands in a cursory, fidgeting manner. Then, he gave Sam a greeting stare.</p>
<p>Lowering to Ritand&rsquo;s view, he said, pushing aside Don&rsquo;s leg, “Get out of the way.&quot;</p>
<p>When it came to Sam&rsquo;s response, looking downwards, he raised his head, cleared his throat, and said, “Ritand, how sweet! Sick father, again?”</p>
<p>Stretching the view to include Bata, he and Ritand pointed their eyes at him, turning their heads toward the cages around them. Bata was holding onto Ritand’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sam said, clearing his throat, wrinkling his nose: &ldquo;My troopers&hellip; they&rsquo;re working.&rdquo; He followed Bata and Ritand&rsquo;s eyes, looking at the cages as well.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Ritand said okay, and Bata pushed the pouch of Ritand behind him, patting Don’s leg twice.</p>
<p>With her attention captured, Don turned around, sat on her haunches, and realigned Ritand’s pouch’s straps up and down until Ritand gave an okay.</p>
<p>In conclusion, not much was said, but Don, Ritand, and Bata were generally comfortable. Sam was making strange statements, but Don was in understanding. Though, she wasn&rsquo;t exactly keen on establishing a long coherent discussion, so their meeting ended with not much said. However, they did already know what to do. The meeting was merely a formality, even if it had nothing to do with the word &ldquo;formal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Casting light on a new stage, later, outside Sam&rsquo;s tent and at the camp frontline, Don sat down on a pair of piled logs, putting her foot against a pile of gravel. Ritand and Bata were nearby.</p>
<p>Don pointed to the left, as goblin workers followed Don’s direction.</p>
<p>Bata cracked his fingers on one hand, using only the thumb of the same hand to do it, and walked in a circle. Ritand hugged a log and leaned down on it.</p>
<p>“It’s&hellip;” Don imitated a clicking sound, stretched a hand backward, and turned her head around to stare at Sam’s tent. “&hellip;right over there.”</p>
<p>Bata rested his chin on his hand and squinted, as a bunch of fishmen passed by him. Ritand glanced at Bata and turned his head toward a loud thud. He got up from the ground and climbed until he was beside Don.</p>
<p>In the distance, six goblins carried a log that fell on their legs. Don dashed and helped these six goblins out of their predicament.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Ritand and Bata got off the log, as a host of figures wandered close to the site. The two goblins took a deep breath and sighed halfway.</p>
<p>Riding onto a more tense mood, Ritand raised his brows and lip-pointed to them, shaking his hands. “It’s them—the warning!” he said, putting his cup down. As all of the other goblins strided along still, Ritand repeated himself, crescendoing at the phrase “the warning.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere taking a new shape, Bata lifted his head toward a meteor of smokeless fire blasting the camp’s most vulnerable side, his brows squinting somewhat. In the blast, screams pointed at the gory pastes of fishmen.</p>
<p>Introducing Don, Bata, and Ritand&rsquo;s new enemies, in the distance, adventurers slid down the slope and overtook the half-armored goblins. They swung and clashed until these goblins hit the floor.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they held back when they attacked and gave their all when they defended. They hoped that the goblins only died because of their bad falls.</p>
<p>As for the response of Sam and his men, the last fishmen came out of their tents and cast spells of ice that pushed back the adventurers until they retreated.</p>
<p>The fishmen gathered themselves and composed their spirits into one arcane blast of impaling halberds of ice.</p>
<p>Elevating their actions onto a more symbolic layer, their anger united them under a common banner of revenge.</p>
<p>Swinging to the result of the fishmen&rsquo;s attacks, soon enough, the impaled adventurers dotted the floor, as their bodies became a stench.</p>
<p>Turning to something more disturbing than blasts of ice, the fishmen gathered the adventurers&rsquo; bodies and consumed them, shining with golden light for a moment. On another note, in blows of feet against the ground floor, they waved their hands and took sharp inhales.</p>
<p>Similarly, they each drank a mana potion, as they slung their heavy arms to cast the impaling ice, crying. The side effects of mana potions and their current emotion state combined to make them psychotic.</p>
<p>Ascending to a highly metaphorical domain, they felt the grace of gods pushing them to eradicate the enlightened species, the humans. An eagle spread forth above them and guided them toward victory. The light above became their love, and their love spread forth through magical, sickening gorges in front of them.</p>
<p>In that very moment, besides the dead adventurers, the living ones ran, but the goblins caught up on four legs and surrounded them. As a side note, they rubbed some dirt off their hands on their trousers.</p>
<p>Expanding on the goblins&rsquo; ferocity, they edged closer every time the adventurers eyed the goblins’ weapons, fidgeting and twisting their body around.</p>
<p>Several moments later, bringing Don into the stage, she placed her hand against the goblins as they fled, guiding them away from the adventureres&rsquo; arrows and blasts.</p>
<p>Including Sam into the picture, she turned her head toward him as he fell. Behind the goblins, Sam shifted one arm forward and rubbed the elbow with his other hand. “What is it?” he said after he drunk a mana potion. Spreading attention to the background, a fishman flanked him a long distance away on each side.</p>
<p>In the same picture, Bata said, grabbing Ritand by the arm, heading toward Sam, “Don?”</p>
<p>Focusing on Sam&rsquo;s state after he fell, his mouth, eyes, cheeks, and nose turned still. His back became as straight as a stool.</p>
<p>Adjusting to the larger background, the fight with the adventurers continued.</p>
<p>Moving the mood to a lighter one, Ritand caressed Bata’s back and pressed him to do the same.</p>
<p>“Sam, Sam.” Don steepled her fingertips against a potion on her thighs.</p>
<p>Bata said, “Look at their marks—”</p>
<p>He hoped that Don would be pleased with his performance.</p>
<p>Ritand said, “The birthmarks!”</p>
<p>He felt the same as Bata did.</p>
<p>“Birthmarks? This is a high turnover,” Sam said, holding up steepled fingertips. He shouted an incantation: “Tier 2 Shock—”</p>
<p>“Wrong spell,” Ritand said, placing his hand in front of Sam’s face and waving it. Because Sam canceled his spell, his stomach turned over.</p>
<p>Ritand took a deep breath, raised her brows hard, and locked eyes with Don.</p>
<p>Don grinned.</p>
<p>Ritand smiled back, and Bata grinned with an open smile.</p>
<p>A slow wail in the distance blared, as Ritand rubbed his hands together.</p>
<p>Don closed her fingers and tapped Ritand’s shoulder and then his hands. He gazed at Ritand and shot the toy back to Bata. Ritand shoved Don’s hands off and threw out a thank you.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you food later, okay?” he said, frowning on one side of his face.</p>
<p>Ritand curled his lips inward and twisted his head to the side, avoiding Don’s eyes.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the safer edges of the battle, goblin workers grouped up on a large cart, some of them hanging to the side and back. They hurried out of the camp site to the closest city, grumbling and pushing one another. Moreover, one of them carried the name &ldquo;Sicario,&rdquo; who would play a role in Don and the two goblins&rsquo; journey later on.</p>
<p>They winced at the fishmen’s glances toward them every time they tapped their fingers on the weapons that they tucked away at the side.</p>
<p>Recentering onto the middle of the brawl, goblin warriors fell to the ground, as the adventurers threw javelins and swung at them.</p>
<p>The goblin warriors hurled their handles back and forth, lodging their weapons into a whirl of sullying plumps. The adventurers danced in a mockery of javelins, tossing their torsos with the shots that they flung.</p>
<p>The youngest of the goblins fixed their simple bows in their sweat, shooting anyhow.</p>
<p>The goblins stormed into a human and skewered him with their silky whisks and sick tugs. The humans hurled the goblins off him and stuck around in a fight to the death, running off in a pike charge.</p>
<p>Incorporating Don into this fight, she trudged forth into battle, raised her arms, and stood in the way. She was charging, and she put her cloaked hand over the face of the human the goblins targeted and flung him away.</p>
<p>Don commanded the clouds forth to pull her into the fight. The load of castles sunk under her arms, as they transformed into hundreds of ships of stone. She beat her arms across the sea of muddy earth, hurling herself over the human’s face.</p>
<p>She submerged in his mouth a cloaked, feathery hand, choking him. Then, she swung him into the edges of her sight.</p>
<p>The human broke his back, as red liquid wet his palate.</p>
<p>The goblins congratulated, becoming a tapestry of thank yous.</p>
<p>Don dismissed them with a wave, handling a wet cloth with her other hand.</p>
<p>The humans shielded the fleeing human whom Don had thrown. Moreover, they guided him into their breaking fold-like formaton.</p>
<p>Directing the spotlight to the broader fight, every time a goblin ate a blade with their body, these humans twisted and galloped, jerking off their halberds and swords to further effect.</p>
<p>For each dead goblin, an allied knife plunged into them, and an undead version of them rose off the inanimate ground, twisting its back.</p>
<p>The humans whirled their hands into waves of forward thrusts, as the ground listened to their incantations. Mud bursted from the ground, replacing the hard soil below it. Don hissed, trudging away to avoid getting caught.</p>
<p>Incidental to this ongoing fight, goblin’s head covers fell into pockets, and necklaces were rotated so that they were at the back. Wool trousers took in most of the wealth.</p>
<p>Anyway, introducing the leader of the adventurers, Solvent, a human raid leader, matched Don’s height shoulder-to-shoulder. At the moment, she dangled an oversized necklace above her shoulders. In the larger fight, she huffed each time she hit the goblin vanguards, blunting their shields and armor tips and edges. Overall, she represented the adventurers, but she was also her own person.</p>
<p>Breaking new ground with metaphorical expression, the sky screamed into a radial platitude of sonnet winds at Solvent&rsquo;s careful movements. The goblins hurled back and forth with the waves of her tingling sky of sword swings. Their metal crumbled under the weight of her composition. The necklace held over her the sky of self-abandonment and, yet, immortality.</p>
<p>As for her succeeding actions, Solvent said, “Tire them long enough.” She raised her head, eying the back of the goblins. She pressed two fingers across her forehead and slid them down to her nose, pressing it. She retracted her fingers and huffed, as her furrowed stare tightened further.</p>
<p>“Go!” The monsters’ strongest, Don, threw her bare fist ahead, as Solvent swung, steering downwards columns of adventurers.</p>
<p>Solvent slammed her fists as she ran.</p>
<p>The perspiring goblin frontline charged anyhow through the shrubby slope, holding somehow onto one another and the outcropping rock ledges and creeping figs.</p>
<p>Unveiling magic in an immersive way, Solvent strummed up tiny orbs from her hands and passed them along the winds until they disappeared. A toxic gas leapt from her mouth, but she lost her energy to stand, finding a tiny hiccup flying from her throat. “Heaven’s Joy!” she said, her words inviting the magical winds and beckoning a spell&rsquo;s appearance.</p>
<p>After the able raiders got Solvent off the arrows’ trajectory, the air exploded in front of the goblins, signalling the completion of Solvent&rsquo;s magic spell.</p>
<h2 id="prologue-2-the-monster-trios-dealings">Prologue (2): The Monster Trio&rsquo;s Dealings <a href="#prologue-2-the-monster-trios-dealings" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="material-icons align-middle">link</i></a></h2><p>When Solvent&rsquo;s spell hit the air, she and the rest of the adventurers left the scene.</p>
<p>Some time after the fight ended, goblins who had survived fight covered their faces.</p>
<p>Involving Don, Bata, and Ritand into this aftermath, they gazed at the falling goblins that had leapt back. They wandered around into their places, quipping at the messy dead.</p>
<p>They shuddered.</p>
<p>The goblin frontline bruised their buttocks when they fell earlier, and some of them had fractured a bone.</p>
<p>The monster trio, Don, Ritand, and Bata, put on their dry clothes and accessories and fixed them until they looked neat. Don was counting the casualties, placing down an empty potion. Ritand grabbed the potion and handed it to Bata, and Bata refilled it to half full with another potion.</p>
<p>Shifting to the decision of Sam and the rest of the fishmen, they left the authority to the goblin leaders and Don.</p>
<p>So Don followed what the fishmen did often in the past: she ordered them to cage the undead goblins. Also, she said that it was advisable for the cages to have food provisions and bags of deodorizing, used coffee grounds.</p>
<p>Afterwards, they went home.</p>
<p>At the end of their short travel, their cracking home city gates welcomed them and bothered them with sour scents.</p>
<p>This opened up a new stage.</p>
<p>Taking a look at what people in this city were like, most of them here lived according to what the newspapers said that the nobles were like. They were coffee-crazed, followed through with promises, each drank a teaspoon of red potion after work, and so on.</p>
<p>Allowing a new perspective into the stage, a goblin worker, Sicario, who left early in the defense with the other workers, stood on the road to the right of the arriving party that included Don, Ritand, Bata, and Sam. He said, “The invaders have kneeled down and complied at our every advantage—” The plump goblins in front of him nodded, rubbing their hands together and embracing one another.</p>
<p>Sam heard the word &ldquo;ambush&rdquo; from Sicario to describe what they did to the humans and hesitated, glancing between himself and the goblin warriors with him in the cart. “No.”</p>
<p>Sicario leaned forward, grabbed a dagger on the ground, rolled his head to the side, and rushed away. He came back and handed an old manuscript which he had been hiding inside a small gap in the wall beneath a window frame.</p>
<p>“The meeting engagement had its place,” Sam said, giving a furrowed stare at the goblins pointing their fists at Sicario.</p>
<p>Shifting view to his mind, he organized his thoughts and filed them under specific details in his memory cards. He felt secure in this mind chamber.</p>
<p>Taking focus to the background, a crowd had gathered in front of Sicario and the rest of the arriving party.</p>
<p>He put his voice down on the heads of the crowd in front of him as he would with a table: “Yes, the meeting engagement began with the search party we sent in hopes they found an enlightened traveler.” Sam shifted his clothes to fit and his smile further up at the ene of each sentence.</p>
<p>The congregation listened to his words and acknowledged his report.</p>
<p>Tucking this scene into a corner and transitioning to a new, different segment, to Sam’s left, deep in a narrow alleyway, the monster trio—Don, Ritand, and Bata—murmured among themselves as they snickered. They handed it over their damaged items in bags to Kyra, a helmeted public servant inside a guild. They exchanged items through a barred window at the front of a long line of plump goblins.</p>
<p>Taking a further look at these goblins, they were wiping their sweat away and pointing their fists toward the distance. Some of them wanted the rainy seasons to come.</p>
<p>Anyway, the monster trio thought about a funny connection and wanted to keep enjoying themselves after the boring or tiring fight. Continuing the inclusion of Kyra, the public servant, who was a female fishman, emptied her mind every time that she felt stressed about a faraway but crucial human war.</p>
<p>She threw away the smallest scraps at the bottom of the bags, closing the door on a collection of trash. She said, “Having a lament in a party?&quot;</p>
<p>“Problem? said Don, accepting a pouch of cash from Kyra. “Do you feel enlightened after taking this job?”</p>
<p>Kyra shushed him, and another fish person Cali answered her. Cali had passed behind Kyra and was plumping down dugout chests beside a door. What Cali said was, “Is your orders here by now—”</p>
<p>Shifting to this new person&rsquo;s thoughts, Cali wanted to get out of move to the city away from these slums, but her father wanted her to stay humble. Her father meant that he wanted her to work under Sam instead of a more popular candidate for nation president.</p>
<p>Anyhow, Kyra thought that Cali needed a break after seeing her carry the chests.</p>
<p>Traveling back to an earlier scene, before the monster trio came, Cali leaned against a table and sat down with a weird posture to deal with the back pains.</p>
<p>In the present, Kyra was remembering this scene.</p>
<p>Ignoring Don, Ritand, Bata, and the rest of those in line, Cali watched the gold coins scattering across the floor from the chests. They had fallen while Kyra was in a contemplative mood.</p>
<p>Kyra picked them up two by two and sprayed them across with her sanitizing magic. Some of the coins rolled out the open door.</p>
<p>Pivoting to the two young goblins&rsquo; entrances, Bata grabbed these outside coins, coming inside, while Ritand patted Bata on the side and told Kyra to straighten up.</p>
<p>Bata asked Ritand to use magic to wet his hands.</p>
<p>Ritand shook his head, but he obeyed anyway.</p>
<p>Bata put his hands against Ritand’s back and continued massaging him, following him around.</p>
<p>Cuing in Kyra, she squinted, raised an eyebrow, and winced at Ritand’s light slap to her back, as she straightened her back.</p>
<p>She took a pursed-lip sigh, as she listened to Don mumbling “Sam.” Don handed her a magical instrument alongside a summary report paper that Kyra folded and tucked under her arm.</p>
<p>After checking a few papers and answering interrogatory questions, the monster trio left the office.</p>
<p>Changing to the outside, at their left, boats lined up behind buildings and on the edge of a levee alongside a river, acting as a wall that broke the waves. Moreover, cobblestones and boulders piled up throughout them; one of the boats had a forest growing on it.</p>
<p>Eventually, having gone a long distance from Kyra and Cali&rsquo;s workplace, Don, Bata, and Ritand slipped inside an inn far from the river, where they slept in their dried sweat.</p>
<p>This sleep lasted 4 hours.</p>
<p>When Ritand and Bata woke up some time later, they found Don imitating a voice crack as part of a joke story at the inn’s bar counter. She was placing a small mug in front of her when Ritand pinched her on the arm. She retracted her arm and placed the mug down to her left. Incidentally, a mother and a child entered the inn.</p>
<p>As for Don, she made many mistakes since she woke up. And one of them was standing up abruptly and spilling her drink after a bartender put two mugs next to her arms. She apologized and handled the payments, glancing between her money and the mother and child. They approached Ritand and Bata, but the young goblins ignored the mother.</p>
<p>Ritand asked Bata about what they were going to do next, staring at a green mountain.</p>
<p>As he shifted the pouch of Ritand behind him, Bata smiled, touched the bottom of Ritand’s pouch, and said, &ldquo;If he was here, how do you think he would react?” His tone shifted from somewhat abrasive to delighted.</p>
<p>Bata remembered their horrible parents because of their excitement for traveling.</p>
<p>Bata and Ritand knew they were in their twenties, but they would rather live a simple, carefree life like children.</p>
<p>Ritand looked at Don, who finished getting his money and handed it over to the mother. She bowed his head after he learned her ethnicity from her features.</p>
<p>Ritand wanted Don to stop helping people if that meant she would finally stop feeling her absurd guilt.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the mother imagined the future where she was a spirit and could only watch her child struggling to survive.</p>
<p>Returning to the monster trio, when the two goblins finally went outside, Don rushed out, following them.</p>
<p>There, Ritand stretched backwards and stared down at a food shop.</p>
<p>Don tucked inside Ritand’s pouch a pamphlet from the hare people and asked, “Should Georta be spoken with your cousins?”</p>
<p>Bata said “Yes,” and Ritand nodded his head, turning his head elsewhere.</p>
<p>Don inquired more about the language, asking what words meant.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, Ritand rubbed his hands together, as Don looked toward a slow wail in the distance. This combination of Ritand rubbing his hands and a slow wail signalled another shift in the direction of their journey. As for the reason of their next action, it would be revealed a little later.</p>
<p>Ritand blasted the corner of a shop, making it like a smokeless fiery furnace. A familiar mother and child in the shop dropped backwards, leaning toward a hiding place.</p>
<p>Ritand studied the crowd: goblins, fishmen, trolls, and hare people. The goblins in the crowd grabbed the trolls’ long arm strong hairs and leapt from troll to troll. The fishmen rode carts, and the hare people were like vehicles, crawling through the streets.</p>
<p>After Don had saved the mother and child and wet their clothes with a red liquid, she handed them a cloth. She dashed past and below the goblins hanging on the trolls that trudged through the streets.</p>
<p>Don pushed through the crowd, looking behind her at Ritand, Bata, the mother, and the child. He gave a thumbs up, to which the child waved.</p>
<p>Don smirked, fading in the distance.</p>
<p>Bata’s head wandered toward Don, but he was too late to see her.</p>
<p>Moving to Don&rsquo;s spirit, thunderstorms and hail clashed inside it, as her feelings dripped against the pavement. She fell backwards and spilled these staining feelings, watching as her hands smudged against the floor. She was standing up again, and her mind was a maelstrom, a disaster upon the street walls and the nightly storming of the crowds.</p>
<p>Ripping this imaginitive sequence apart and jumping to the action, Don fell over.</p>
<p>Far behind Don, Bata put one hand on Ritand and hardened his hand, watching a mass of smokeless fire continue down to the inner-city. The centre of the fire faded away, as Bata was huffing, yet the fire was raging on. “Squatters’ area,” Ritand said, pointing at the wet market and the slums.</p>
<p>A host of shields appeared everywhere, as people watched the strongest among them take control of the commotion. The strongest was a familiar human face, Solvent, who cocked her head at Ritand in the crowd and gestured toward Bata with complicit understanding.</p>
<p>Marking a new, bold step in their journey, Ritand and Bata nodded at Solvent, staring at a muddy hole where one of Solvent&rsquo;s comrades, a human, crawled out. He asked Ritand and Bata for help in coming out, wearing helmets and many layers of clothing.</p>
<p>He grabbed Bata and Ritand’s hands, and with Ritand’s lift, he tumbled inside Ritand’s pouch that held more than it looked. “Yeah, that’s her,” Ritand said vaguely, curling his lips.</p>
<p>The human thanked him, as red potion liquid wet his palate, healing his wounds.</p>
<p>Ritand grabbed the human’s peeking leg and pushed it back in, chewing his lip.</p>
<p>While this was happening, on another side of the city, a wagon, rubbing around his mouth until his moustache became dry, Sam said, “‘The two rugrats are there.’” He nodded and released a human prisoner, ignoring the prisoner’s heroic claims.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, closer to Don, Bata, and Ritand, Solvent swung in the streets, steering downwards columns of adventurers, directing them to fight.</p>
<p>Returning to Sam, in the blurry distance of Solvent, Sicario, a human that had disguised as a goblin worker, arrived with Sam. He asked, “Do you want her as the next top executive?”</p>
<p>Sam laughed. “What, like little Exterme? No one can be me. I have to do this.” He put his hands on Sicario, taking the dagger out of his pocket and placing it in his hands.</p>
<p>Changing to an aggressive tone, Sicario leapt through the crowd to Solvent, grabbed her leg, and stabbed at her. “Sam wants you dead!”</p>
<p>Moving away from this temporarily, at the back of the crowd watching the commotion, Kyra sorted through her pouch and raised a weighty, disproportionate magical instrument. With dark circles around her eyes, she shook the mechanical toy, hyperventilating.</p>
<p>Advancing to some time after Sicario&rsquo;s confrontation, he saw an insect flying in his peripheral view, and his eyes unfocused and refocused at the faraway Kyra.</p>
<p>Nearby, Solvent had fallen to the ground.</p>
<p>Sicario gained a new spell and added it to his inventory of spells. He imagined a grandiose future for himself and smiled, having removed Solvent as a posed danger.</p>
<p>He filled her up with toxic gas, turning away to the crowd and saluting.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Sam appeared from behind Sicario, setting himself down on the edge of a platform. Sicario dropped off it and dashed out of sight, sustaining his salute.</p>
<p>Reverting to Don, who had been in the scene the entire time, being an ally of Solvent, Don got out from the crowd behind Sicario and being both out of sight, bludgeoned him to death.</p>
<p>Earlier, Don felt that she found her opportunity. She wanted to get by like this, waiting for a random moment to strike.</p>
<p>She got lucky maybe, but if this worked her entire life, she was sure that this was right.</p>
<p>With Sicario dead, Sam’s goblin workers leapt to stop Don, but she was too strong.</p>
<p>When Sam turned the corner with the intention of reuniting with Sicario, Don grabbed and pushed him to the ground, breaking his arms and crushing his chest.</p>
<p>Sam yelled and screamed until he shrieked. He lost his life midway.</p>
<p>In the end, Don was huffing, studying Sam’s body, having defeated Sam&rsquo;s workers. She knew Sam was coming, so she ambushed him.</p>
<p>Starting a new journey, Bata and Ritand arrived and edged toward Don, asking her if she was okay.</p>
<p>Don raised his brows, still staring at Sam.</p>
<p>When Bata stood shoulder-to-shoulder, Don turned his head at Bata’s face.</p>
<p>Bata yelped, leaping away. Ritand caught Bata, asking Don what was going on.</p>
<p>Don stared at him in silence. She walked away, watching the goblin workers shriek when she came close. The strongest among them were too injured to do anything.</p>
<p>Don left the streets toward the gates.</p>
<p>Bata and Ritand followed him.</p>
<p>They wanted to know if Don did this because of her plan. They knew Don hid some things from them, especially her plan, but they wanted to know if this was what was supposed to happen.</p>
<p>Don stared at the ground as she walked over the uneven road, going around and jumping over potholes.</p>
<p>However, reintroducing Sam’s bandaged goblin warriors from the fight with the humans, they emerged and went in front of the monster trio, blocking the way.</p>
<p>Don gestured for them to move, glancing between the roads in front of her.</p>
<p>The bandaged goblin warriors asked to join Don.</p>
<p>Don glanced at Ritand and Bata.</p>
<p>They knew what to do.</p>
<h2 id="prologue-3-dons-assault-and-aftermath">Prologue (3): Don&rsquo;s Assault and Aftermath <a href="#prologue-3-dons-assault-and-aftermath" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="material-icons align-middle">link</i></a></h2><p>Bata went in front of the goblin warriors who had declared allegiance to Don and ordered them by their features.</p>
<p>Ritand asked for them to remove all their things except their clothes and put their things into his dimensional storage pouch.</p>
<p>Many days later, Don sent two goblins out of the forty to work with Kyra and Cali. At the public servant office, they took on basic requests like carrying dugout chests and other items of significant weight.</p>
<p>The two assigned goblins, Twerp and Birdie, improvised a song about Sam’s fall. Twerp handed to Birdie a mechanical toy that had fallen from the office counter in the night. Kyra put each of them under direct management of Cali, who swore that her father sent them to her.</p>
<p>Twerp wanted to make sure his small duty made waves for Don, whom they described as a troubled leader.</p>
<p>It was Ritand who handed them documents on how to handle Kyra and Cali.</p>
<p>When they opened the documents, the only thing that read was “Don’t tell them about this, but please get me a small mechanical toy from there.”</p>
<p>Birdie told Twerp to ignore Ritand’s requests and focus on getting Kyra and Cali whatever help they needed. Don made sure he funded them enough to enjoy themselves and start a business.</p>
<p>Twerp looked confused most of the time. This made Kyra give him the most physical work, while Birdie got some time to learn his hand at calligraphy.</p>
<p>Birdie put each word into perspective, grabbing the small parts of it and turning it into a spell.</p>
<p>His mana was insufficient for a spell, and even if he threw money at the papers, his improvised spells failed to manifest.</p>
<p>Twerp operated on every muscle in his body, imagining how far and wide his reach could be if he had a magic for it.</p>
<p>These two goblins had similar dispositions with the rest of the goblin race toward magic and humans.</p>
<p>Twerp reified this disposition through creating a small mana potion with Cali after she showed him the way to combine the elements.</p>
<p>Birdie wanted more out of his daily activities as a public servant’s assistant. He asked Cali who Kyra&rsquo;s “employer” was. He meant “the employer that directs her and tells her what to do in her life, not work.”</p>
<p>Cali pointed to the memorial outside of the city mayor Sam. She said, “Sam was also my father’s ‘employer.’”</p>
<p>Earlier, Don sent Ritand and Bata to the office.</p>
<p>By the time they arrived, it was right after Cali pointed at the memorial, where the two young goblins were walking toward her.</p>
<p>They met Birdie first outside the office.</p>
<p>Ritand said, “Have you done your trivial assignment?”</p>
<p>Birdie raised a brow and got Twerp to come out.</p>
<p>Twerp looked at Birdie and imitated his expression of disappointment. “Why did you come?” he said, his voice somewhat tired but excited to humor himself and those around him.</p>
<p>“I needed a little bit of that help for a grand project with the&hellip; big bad.”</p>
<p>“‘The big bad?’” said Solvent, putting one foot in front of her before leaning against a wall that retained a small forest. “That’s Don, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Twerp observed the clashing expressions of the two goblins and Solvent, nudging Birdie for them to leave. The two goblins left and continued their tasks, stopping Kyra from inquiring about the three outside.</p>
<p>Solvent put down her crutch and asked: “Is Don still alive? Sounds like it.” She had a smile that fit the V-shape in her armor. “She’s a she, right?” She laughed too long for it to sound genial.</p>
<p>Twerp peeked from a window, making sure that his whispers to Birdie were dead silent. “What’s up with the tall human in Orlata City?”</p>
<p>“Don is a shell of imperviousness, and her spirit forbids all infiltrations.”</p>
<p>“Eh, tough times we have here—”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, nearby, having lived through the assassination, Solvent stomped her foot forward and then stayed standing.</p>
<p>After a stare between the two shaking goblins and the raid leader, Solvent fell to the ground, slamming against the pavement.</p>
<p>She cursed, asking the two for help.</p>
<p>Twerp and Birdie came out to help her get up.</p>
<p>Ritand held onto Solvent’s hand and pushed her back down. “How’s that for a beatdown—”</p>
<p>“W-what is this?” Kyra asked. Cali followed and inquired the same.</p>
<p>“I assuaged Solvent’s deep threats against the Sam memorial right here,” Birdie said as he read Ritand’s intentions from his face. He had listened to Ritand explain before the two public servants came.</p>
<p>“Where is this Solvent? This?” Cali stepped in front of Kyra and held up Birdie’s skirt.</p>
<p>“Excuse me?” Birdie was half-laughing. He moved his skirt out of the way and gestured toward Solvent. “Pile of dog water fell from the sun.”</p>
<p>Solvent had a blank expression on her face, as she stared at Birdie and then at Cali and Kyra. “Not a nice way to go about this.” She stood up, supporting herself with her crutch again. She chuckled when she half-tripped, taking in the pitying expressions around her. “Stop, stop.” She was smiling, and then, she frowned. “Stop. Too long. Manners, manners.”</p>
<p>Cali put her hand on her hips, bringing Kyra back inside. She gave Birdie and Twerp a meaningful glance as she left.</p>
<p>Twerp’s mouth was agape, and Birdie wanted to ask Don who Solvent was.</p>
<p>Solvent half-smiled.</p>
<p>Cali and Kyra were quiet and finished their business, coming out a few hours later.</p>
<p>They went down the street, passing the road as lizard-drawn carts and hare people made up the only official vehicles.</p>
<p>Cali and Kyra separated ways, as Cali hurled herself down a flight of steps and landed on the bottom with her legs fine.</p>
<p>She opened a door and spun her way inside, looking at the fishmen younglings sleeping in different corners of the room.</p>
<p>Cali lost the flow of her father’s money when Sam died. Moreover, she lost the properties that her father dedicated to Sam and would pass down to her.</p>
<p>She wanted to start again as someone else now that her father stopped paying her to work at the office. She had learned that her father only found a hopeless future after the assassination.</p>
<p>She remembered the two goblins and their dedication to their small work. She asked them the first time they came why they were here. Birdie said: “Don has everything prepared for us. All one needs to do is receive it.” Twerp was like “What he said.”</p>
<p>When it was still dark in the morning, she traveled through many social paths outside of the city to the foot of a cave. She remembered that Twerp described Don’s presence as brooding. She brushed her thoughts aside and reminded herself to focus on getting everything out of the way. She took opportunities: sometimes, these risks failed like the one her father offered her.</p>
<p>She wanted to know if this one would kickstart a better life for her. Her children had to wait for her to get strong before she could teach them how to be strong.</p>
<p>She looked inside the cave, seeing a bunch of goblins telling each other spooky stories.</p>
<p>The goblins stood up, naked and barehanded.</p>
<p>She screamed and ran around, jumping around until she leapt from the cave and past the trees.</p>
<p>She returned, staring at the goblins who stared back at her.</p>
<p>She asked them about Don.</p>
<p>They turned around as they sat on their boulders.</p>
<p>One of them was Birdie.</p>
<p>“I’ve been expecting you,” he said, smiling with his cheeks dimply.</p>
<p>She muttered a curse and trudged forward. “Why,” she said, “did you not give me any information that could have made sure I did not fall, trip, or die?”</p>
<p>Birdie’s expression became awkward.</p>
<p>He thought that Cali would learn how to navigate this place as he did. “Did you get lost?”</p>
<p>“No. I saw more than 10—15—goblins staring at me. So close to catching me!”</p>
<p>Birdie gave a nervous laugh and led her inside.</p>
<p>Don was somewhere there, standing up and reading a doorstopper book. “Why would I?” she said, asking Solvent.</p>
<p>“Were you not supposed to ‘die’ with me?” the raid leader said, holding the hand of one of the adventurers under her. This adventurer underling was shaking.</p>
<p>“Ah, I see,” said Cali.</p>
<p>“Dysfunctional relationship,” Birdie said.</p>
<p>Cali gave him a confused stare.</p>
<p>Birdie scratched his head. “You’ll see what I mean.”</p>
<p>Don stopped talking when she noticed Cali.</p>
<p>Cali saw Solvent and said, “Oh, that crutched—”</p>
<p>“Crutched? Please get your words right, ma’am.” She gestured to herself standing up and dashing around.</p>
<p>“You. Lying?”</p>
<p>“I did, not for bad reasons, you see. I love helping others, don’t I, Don?”</p>
<p>Don was rubbing her chin, looking to the left past Solvent at the wall.</p>
<p>Solvent gave a nervous chuckle and pointed toward a seat in the far left of Don. “Sit there, Cali.”</p>
<p>Cali gazed at Birdie.</p>
<p>“Cali, yes, all accounts point to that being her name, most certainly,” Birdie said, losing his voice projection. “Wow, who has the answers to such a phenomenon?” He cleared his throat.</p>
<p>Cali turned away.</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” Birdie said. His tone was quiet and serious.</p>
<p>Don watched the small goblins converse with the human. Behind her face, she was thinking about where they should drop in the middle of the human war.</p>
<p>Eventually, their conversation ended on an open-ended note, allowing time for their relationship to grow naturally. Don&rsquo;s goal here was simple—to keep his current position clear and safe from disruption and scrutiny, especially since he was the one who had killed Sam. But even the wounded goblin warriors didn&rsquo;t know that. Indeed, Birdie and Twerp had no idea about Don&rsquo;s murder of Sam and Sicario.</p>
<h2 id="prologue-4---the-hermits-task-and-the-mimic">Prologue (4) - The Hermit&rsquo;s Task and the Mimic <a href="#prologue-4---the-hermits-task-and-the-mimic" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="material-icons align-middle">link</i></a></h2><p>Moving on to a new stage, a small group of human adventurers passed by Don’s cave.</p>
<p>They wanted a good look at this small cave system in the mountain. It was far enough from Orlata City, a different city from the aforementioned one, and close enough for a three days’ travel on horseback to and fro.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one of them had signed themselves in Solvent’s church. She was an official there that made waves under their nation’s National Commission on Adventurers. This paved the way for their eventual alliance with Don.</p>
<p>So Don came into an agreement with them to pay them handsomely whenever they came to clear monsters unrelated to her and her associates within her cave system.</p>
<p>As for why the adventurers teamed up with Don, one of the reasons included her disguise. Specifically, her disguise was a hermit mage. She even played the role of a storyteller. On top of that, Now Don&rsquo;s committed ally, Solvent, had arranged it so that the adventurers were well-fooled to believe that Don was known in this area.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Bata arrived with the two goblins Birdie and Twerp at Orlata City. Back at the cave, the rest of the goblin warriors were reading books about history, and Don was giving them quizzes. After every quiz, she let them take a break to hunt to get their fill of the day.</p>
<p>Eventually, while all of this was happening, the humans attacked Bata, Birdie, and Twerp and put them in cages. They were current outside Orlata City and had set up camp.</p>
<p>While imprisoned, Bata played with his mechanical toy, while Birdie and Twerp sang songs: “Go to the city to the west, and I’ll reward you with a pretty heavy wand.”</p>
<p>Three members of the adventurer group turned left and right and asked one another what city he was talking about. They were confused and could only assume.</p>
<p>These three stayed behind, while the rest of the members of this adventurer group went down the path to Orlata city, entered it, and prepared to sleep there. They stayed at the foreign inns and ate the monster cuisine there.</p>
<p>One of the three adventurers remaining in the camp, Algae said, “I should know that all hermits ask you to get something faraway as a last request.”</p>
<p>“Assuredly, you know the foes of the hermits—the warlocks, remember?” said Kloe, the other adventurer beside Algae.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t know—” said Jared, the one in front, finishing a mouthful of banana cue. He drank from a pouch of water and burped. “Excuse me.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, right&hellip;” said Algae, looking between himself and the hermit striding toward them from the darkness. He nudged Jared and Kloe, cursing. “Is that&hellip;?”</p>
<p>Having come a long way from Sam&rsquo;s city—Promise City—Don, in her hermit form, removed her hood and revealed herself.</p>
<p>From the adventurers&rsquo; perspective, a moment ago, they saw the hermit, and now, replacing the hermit, a troll stood between the adventurers and the way back to Orlata City’s gates, blocking their way. This was a big development for that, and they could only stare and watch. For context, they stayed here to relax at the camp, preferring a station closer to the dungeons, caves, and wilderness. This made it easier for them to move around between the city and their priorities. However, this proved now life-threatening with the rare troll hopping into their crib.</p>
<p>Squeezing into Don&rsquo;s mind, she grunted, asking them if they saw the two goblins Birdie and Twerp, looking for the cages. She had come here with the help of a teleporter mage, but that costed lots of money. So she didn&rsquo;t want to do it again. The reason she knew of Bata and Ritand&rsquo;s absence was because of a skill that tracked them and their wellbeing. This way, she knew exactly their status and whether she needed to come help.</p>
<p>With that said, entering into a previous unresolved event, the late Sam was unprepared to deal with Don enough that she could get away with killing him, Sicario, and many of his goblins. Indeed, his life had been in her hands ever since he began to put her on the frontline and in the tent, or the equivalent thereof, where he practically slept; having trusted Don as Solvent did. It had been a power struggle between the two, representing different sides, human and monster. Solvent was supposed to die to Sicario, or at least that was what Don planned. But she lived, while Sam died—an imperfect conclusion, but one that Don didn&rsquo;t find a reason to correct afterwards.</p>
<p>Regarding Solvent&rsquo;s case, her adventurer members had all died for her sake. So she had nowhere else to turn to, except Don. She didn&rsquo;t want to return because that would be humiliating. It was much more easier to confide in an enemy-turned-friend than a friend with whom one had a long history with enough that any revealed humiliation would only cause her hopelessness and anxiety.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Sam and Solvent&rsquo;s lives fell into Don&rsquo;s palm because of how greedy they were to get an upperhand. That was why they lost everything. This was Don&rsquo;s divide and conquer strategy, one that Ritand and Bata had yet to recognize.</p>
<p>Returning to the confrontation between Don and the adventurers, now that she was here, they were hyperventilating, overshadowed by Don&rsquo;s massive, lumbering yet limber form.</p>
<p>The nine-foot-tall troll was in the distance in front of them, leaning against a tree the side of his knee, resting both hands on it, and stretching her other leg forward. Her head pointed toward her other leg, and she eyed them, grunting, as a dimple formed on her face’s one side.</p>
<p>The adventurers knew that the monsters reputed the trolls to be calm. However, among the humans, they were known to chase down their prey. They were more endurant than humans and any other studied humanoids.</p>
<p>When the troll stepped forward, she discovered RItand and Bata peeking from behind a log and a boulder.</p>
<p>Algae shot an arrow on the ground in front of the scurrying goblins. “Don’t,” he warned the two goblins. The arrow splintered after it slammed against rock, one of its splinters injuring Ritand.</p>
<p>Bata said, “Got it.” The two goblins hopped off the slope and fled away.</p>
<p>Ritand asked Bata for something to cover his wound.</p>
<p>Bata handed him one of his toys. “I only have this,” he said.</p>
<p>Ritand scratched his head, using the cloth parts of the toy to wipe the drips of blood.</p>
<p>Bata began moving around the fight until he was behind Don.</p>
<p>Don responded with a long, hard stare.</p>
<p>Algae raised his arms to shoot.</p>
<p>Don shook his head toward the adventurers, making a warning.</p>
<p>Algae’s arms froze.</p>
<p>Kloe lowered Algae&rsquo;s arms along with the bow, pointing his shield at Don and the running Bata in the distance to make Algae focus.</p>
<p>Having contacted the other goblins at their base with a magical artifact, Bata joined Don and Ritand and said, “The goblins are asking for you. Should I tell them ‘no’?”</p>
<p>Without warning, Don sat on a log and leaned his leg against a pile of gravel. “I can talk. Please.” He lowered his head and raised open palms.</p>
<p>Kloe almost removed his shield, but Jared stopped him, shaking his head. Jared said, “Why are you guys blocking the way? What did we do to you?”</p>
<p>His tone was aggressive, but Don&rsquo;s overwhelming presence kept him flexible.</p>
<p>When one of the goblins offered a mechanical toy, he found himself forcibly laughing. “This is&hellip;” he said, noticing Kloe’s concerned expression.</p>
<p>With this shift in tone, Algae put his bow back in its strap. “I have things to do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If this isn&rsquo;t what I think it is&hellip;” After realizing the possibility of his statement being misinterpreted as aggressive, he tried to lighten the mood, pointing at the small shrubs beside Don jokingly. “I’m going to be eating that, okay?”</p>
<p>Jared chuckled again.</p>
<p>Mysteriously, Don sat up, went over a log, and left.</p>
<p>Bata and Ritand handed Jared the pamphlet from Don, who gave them the agreeing eyes.</p>
<p>The adventurers and the monster trio parted ways on a strange note.</p>
<p>Long after this encounter, returning focus to Promise City, Birdie and Twerp left their small office, saying goodbye to Kyra and Cali. They fidgeted with the mechanical toy that Ritand requested, complaining a customer or two. By the time they reached the city gates, they were guffawing about weird customer they had.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Solvent adjusted her girdle, seeing Birdie and Twerp turn a corner. “Hello, hi. I might have had a little call about two goblins taking a little too much time in the city.”</p>
<p>“No, Don told Bata to tell us that Kyra needed more time with—” said Twerp, bending over to brush the mud off his leg. “Either way, what is it, again, Birdie? What else did he say?”</p>
<p>Birdie said that he forgot, shushing Solvent before she spoke again.</p>
<p>Solvent stopped insulting them and left them to their themselves, continuing her rounds in the inner city.</p>
<p>Resuming Birdie and Twerp&rsquo;s journey on the road outside the city gates, when they passed by a group of adventurers, Birdie saw a hare person sitting in front of Ritand in the distance. “What is Ritand doing—” Birdie said, holding up his mechanical toy and sliding from side to side.</p>
<p>“‘Ritand,’” said Exterme, one of the younger adventurers, trudging up close. “Is the troll Ritand? What is it?”</p>
<p>Birdie raised a brow, chuckling. Twerp stood behind Birdie, studying the hare person.</p>
<p>Exterme stopped his scoff by clearing his throat; instead, his lip curled, and his eyes glinted with a sardonic rage. His mindset had taken a downturn after he lost a good deal with the city mayor Sam after he died.</p>
<p>He unveiled a dagger strapped to his waist.</p>
<p>Unaware, Birdie lowered his arm to his side, saying, “Yeah.” He hesitated, prolonging a vowel. He nudged Twerp on the lower back with his other arm.</p>
<p>In the same scene, Exterme stabbed at Birdie and hardened a whisper. “Tell me. Tell me, please. I need to know, or else, he’ll kill my only friends.”</p>
<p>Birdie fell to the ground, falling away. He died.</p>
<p>Shifting to the larger city, elsewhere, the gate with its water-stained cracks closed, and Cali put each of her children to sleep.</p>
<p>In another place, Don forgot to remove a small fire, trudging toward it, and falling backwards as the night birds fluttered about.</p>
<p>Back at the scene of the murder, Twerp grabbed Birdie’s shoulders and hugged him from behind, pulling him toward a log and boulder.</p>
<p>Exterme chased after them, shouting at Twerp to stop running.</p>
<p>After some time passed, Twerp told Exterme to look behind him.</p>
<p>When Exterme turned around, Algae, Kloe, and Jared grabbed him and put him to sleep.</p>
<p>Now that the chase was over, Twerp let himself collapse, falling to the ground as he tripped backwards, holding again onto Birdie. His face was strained, and his expressions were wrinkly. His mouth was moving up and down, as the hushed voice among the adventurers crescendoed.</p>
<p>Soon, the rest of the goblin warriors arrived, standing before one of their member&rsquo;s decaying body. Their eyes were hard, and then they were soft. They adjusted him until he was curled up.</p>
<p>After the group finally returned to the city and headed to an open forest area, Heset, who was the hare person, said, “How long does a goblin last—oh, sorry, manners.&rdquo; He was a part of the group Exterme belonged to, but he didn&rsquo;t think that Exterme would kill Bata like that. When Exterme chased Twerp, they still couldn&rsquo;t gather up the confidence to kill him. That was why it was a good thing they passed by the camp where Jared, Algae, and Kloe stayed earlier. They had gotten their help to stop Exterme. “How much can a warrior goblin take?” It was a weird question, but he felt that this incident was avoidable if Birdie was stronger. Of course, he knew that it was rest of the party&rsquo;s fault for just watching him chase after Twerp. But Birdie didn&rsquo;t have to die.</p>
<p>They were adventurers, so killing goblins was normal. But these adventurers were part of a new agreement that involved not fighting monsters associated with hermits like Don. Solvent was instrumental in this process, so even if he considered herself a lost soul after her loss, she still had a strong influence among the adventurers. In reality, she just needed a break.</p>
<p>Returning to the moment, incidentally, Ritand touched his pocket, where the mechanical toy Birdie had was.</p>
<p>Bata tried to answer Heset, “Good—”</p>
<p>“Enough for a beating,&quot; interrupted Twerp, echoing what he felt was Heset&rsquo;s mocking tone, directing this tone at Heset.</p>
<p>Heset sat down politely. “Is that how they describe you? ‘Underlings of Sam.’” In order to lighten the mood, he placed his legs on the table in front of him. He had the brightest intentions, but he always found a way to make things offensive.</p>
<p>And the thing was that Ritand and Bata were the ones being patient with him.</p>
<p>Heset was pushing a conversation with them, and Ritand and Bata were letting him do so.</p>
<p>Twerp curled his lip, making sure his arms leaned on the table against Heset’s legs.</p>
<p>Heset put down his legs and turned his head away.</p>
<p>“Don and I are done,” Bata said vaguely, leaning his arms beside Twerp’s hands on the table. “Anything?” He tilted his head toward Twerp and Ritand.</p>
<p>Twerp muttered and left the table at the same time as Heset did, putting on his gambeson.</p>
<p>Some time after this interaction, at an inn at Promise City, Jared smoothened his skirt and sat on a chair, hardening his voice. “Are you sure you want to do a side quest with us?” he said, putting a leg to the side of the chair and his other tiptoing on the ground. For context, Cali had mentioned that she wanted to join their small-time adventurer group. It was Don&rsquo;s first request to her.</p>
<p>“I need a little more though.” Cali raised a hand and made a pinch with two fingers.</p>
<p>They drank mugs of coffee, as Cali noticed Solvent. Solvent was walking backwards and conducting for a traveling choir.</p>
<p>She grabbed her arm and rubbed it back and forth. The presence of Don in the city bothered her, but it made her more safe at the same time.</p>
<p>She got up and finished her task, learning that the choirs had strange birthmarks on their necks.</p>
<p>When Algae left through the door before Jared, he made a hesitation sound first and then said, “That’s Solvent, some church official who has an outreach here. I know her from my time back at NCA.”</p>
<p>“Should I know what that means?” Cali said.</p>
<p>“Weak country, small country, power play stuff,” said Kloe, chewing with his mouth closed. “Why don&rsquo;t you tell me about your time there?.”</p>
<p>Algae slapped his neck, failing to hit a fly sitting on him. “I worked as staff for a month—”</p>
<p>Kloe guffawed and patted Algae on the arm, as Algae drew away, going in front of Jared, who was studying Heset standing on two legs.</p>
<p>“Do they have like an extra muscle in this?” Jared said, teasing Heset.</p>
<p>Heset heard and swore at him.</p>
<p>Jared backed off, laughing so hard he slapped the back of Kloe, who was laughing as well.</p>
<p>Kloe almost tripped from the impact. “Hey!”</p>
<p>Jared glanced between Heset and Kloe. “Apologies&hellip; Oh, yeah, the troll said he’d meet up&hellip; here.”</p>
<p>Eventually, outside the inn, Don arrived, towering over Jared, his expression stiff. He squatted down and said, “Why is it so hot in here?”</p>
<p>Jared raised a brow. “It’s hot in here because it’s the Palamatas.&quot; Seeing an opportunity to mention his goal for coming here to meet Don, he asked, &ldquo;Can we say something?”</p>
<p>Don gave him a stare of agreement.</p>
<p>Jared sighed and moved the things he was holding under his arm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you for asking this once it&rsquo;s over, but how much does a goblin warrior—”</p>
<p>Kloe placed a hand on Jared. He muttered. “After the stunt Algae pulled?” He cursed. To clarify, it was Algae&rsquo;s idea to cage Bata, Birdie, and Twerp earlier, and Jared had been the one most in on it.</p>
<p>Patting his own forehead in contemplation, Jared looked at Algae and nodded, gesturing for him to talk.</p>
<p>Algae went forward and said, “What do you think we should do? You told us to leave you for a few days, and now, what do you want?” He was being direct.</p>
<p>Their previous interactions had been entirely vague due to how uncommunicative Don was as a troll. So this time, Algae was finally breaking the ice and directing everything to this singular point: &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don took a deep breath and handed him a small toy.</p>
<p>Algae backed off two meters of distance instinctively. As a result of this, Kloe and Jared glared at him, worried that Algae&rsquo;s reaction might have offended Don. So Algae ran back to Don. “I think this means we’re fine?” he said.</p>
<p>Don was very bad at communication, but this world was weird. So the adventurers, with their already unique culture, were the closest ones to a sense that things were coherent and clear in terms of communication and direction.</p>
<p>Anyway, Don handed Algae a long list of names, some of which being Birdie’s extended family. At the top of the list, it read “Goblindom.”</p>
<p>Long afterwards, elsewhere, Jared, Kloe, and Algae and the rest of the members of their party &ldquo;Saero&rdquo; dropped off a cart. They surveyed the landscape where Sam’s goblin workers were clearing trees. These were the same workers whom Don had supposedly killed. But they were still alive.</p>
<p>“Sam is dead,” he read from a manuscript Ritand gave him. “Stop.” It was a reminder and a warning to the workers of their current position of weakness and new submission to Don.</p>
<p>The goblin workers looked overworked and dishevealed. Six of the goblin workers had been recuperating for injuries across their arms since Sam’s death. Earlier, these six took a stance against Don, and that was enough for Don to invite them after the goblin warriors.</p>
<p>“Don’t bother repeating,” one of them told Ritand.</p>
<p>Eventually, the goblin workers put down their tools and slumped down onto boulders. Some of them put their hands all over their heads and faces, groaning.</p>
<p>“I should have known Ritand had this in mind,” said Twerp, pacing back and forth behind the goblin workers. He was concerned about the workers, having been harmoniously under Sam with them for a long time.</p>
<p>“Ritand wants you replaced,” said Algae, rubbing his chin.</p>
<p>Surprised, Twerp tripped and dirtied himself.</p>
<p>“Is that enough?” Algae looked at Jared and Kloe, who were nodding at him. They wanted to test Twerp&rsquo;s resolve.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ritand stood in the distance.</p>
<p>Returning to Algae, he sighed and he continued, “I need someone I can trust here. I&rsquo;ll let you guys sort things out—&rdquo; He was referring to the fact that the entire goblin worker group was being used up, so now, having been brought here by Don in order to keep watch, it was hard for him to feel comfortable, because they were adventurers, not Don&rsquo;s donkeys.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute,” said Jared and stood up, speeding up to Algae.</p>
<p>Twerp rubbed the last dirt particles off his clothes at his back. “Don’t worry. I had that with Birdie, I think.” He cupped his chin, failing to pull a boulder under him. He tried grabbing it with two hands and gave up. He sighed, sitting down where two of the goblin workers blocked his line of sight. “I might have done a little challenge under Kyra and Cali, remember?” He looked to his right and covered his mouth. “Ah, right—” He chuckled.</p>
<p>Around the same time, one of the goblin workers insulted one of the adventurers.</p>
<p>“Ah, see, that’s it. Just have a tiny brawl with your buddies. No hard feelings, okay?” He chuckled harder. He softened his voice. “I’m serious.” He saluted toward Extreme, who was passing by.</p>
<p>The adventurers, whose voices were so soft earlier, now shouted at Exterme, worried that he would attack Bata and Ritand since he had killed Birdie. Moreover, they were sure they themselves had sent him to prison. But Exterme was passing by like nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Twerp said: “I found it when you—is it, Jared? Is it fair that he gets to quit the party with only a few scratches—broken bones is fair? Sorry, man. I need more than that—” He was referring to an agreement between him and Jared. For context, Jared had already decided to quit his adventurer party. Moreover, Twerp was angry with Jared since Jared was the one tasked to kill Exterme.</p>
<p>Before anything could happen, Exterme left.</p>
<p>Later, Don got down from a carriage with Bata; the carriage belonged to Cali&rsquo;s father. Behind them, a mother and a child exited and sat down on their haunches at the side. Despite what happened between them in the past, Don had decided to let them come. As for the reasons of Don and the mother, Don just allowed things to happen when it presented itself, while the mother was curious about Don. For context, she didn&rsquo;t know that Ritand had created a magical explosion in the city and that Don had killed Sam. She was just curious after seeing Don earlier and asked to join her.</p>
<p>Anyway, Don minded the rocks on the ground before her and chewed an unpeeled saba banana without pulling it off from the mottled banana hand.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Twerp saluted as a teasing gesture, stopping when Ritand shot him a curious but piercing stare.</p>
<p>Shifting to Ritand, he was eating banana cue, handing half of it to Bata. Bata shook his head, grabbed it, and offered it to Twerp.</p>
<p>Ritand was still staring, as Twerp sat on his haunches with submission.</p>
<p>In the distance, the goblin workers stayed slumping on their boulders, and the adventurers bunched together on a slope like a choir.</p>
<p>Moving on to Bata, he dragged Twerp to him and said, “The mining business is why we are here.” He nodded at Ritand.</p>
<p>Ritand said, “Go with us.” He was holding a pickaxe and slamming at a few cobblestones.</p>
<p>“Just go? Now&hellip;?” Twerp wanted to say, but Ritand handed him a handful of gravel.</p>
<p>Twerp gave him a side glance and took the gravel, shaking as he balanced himself as he walked away. “What should I do&hellip;?”</p>
<p>Ritand said, “Give it to—” He pointed to Exterme, who was lying on the ground because of his broken body. Don pummelled him after seeing him on the way here earlier.</p>
<p>“I should really tell you how to deal with Birdie’s death.” Twerp chuckled, imitating Birdie’s laugh, tone, and words. “I know you’re struggling&hellip;” It was a weird statement, because he was the one that was struggling and confused. Ritand didn&rsquo;t care at all.</p>
<p>Ritand gave him an empty stare, looking at Don.</p>
<p>Don walked up to the goblin workers, listening to them talk about the hare people. She listened to the goblin warriors talk about this earlier, so she was curious.</p>
<p>However, a piercing scream broke Don’s focus.</p>
<p>It was Ritand who screamed. He lost his breath and fell to the ground, as an invisible enemy removed their invisibility to apply the final attack.</p>
<p>The structure of this little community included the goblin warriors, the goblin workers, the adventurers, Solvent, Ritand, Bata, Don, Cali, Kyra, and Twerp, among others. No matter how horrific Ritand scream was, the monsters did not feel anything.</p>
<h2 id="prologue-5---chaos-in-the-city-and-the-forest-encounter">Prologue (5) - Chaos in the City and the Forest Encounter <a href="#prologue-5---chaos-in-the-city-and-the-forest-encounter" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="material-icons align-middle">link</i></a></h2><p>Callously, Don pushed Ritand down the slope, sliding toward the attacker gallopping away.</p>
<p>The adventurers stayed back and watched Don dashing and grabbing at anything to help boost her.</p>
<p>They wanted to know if Don was the powerful hermit they used to see her as.</p>
<p>Calli, who was standing far off from Don, near the attacker, watched the small attacker split to three forms. Each of these forms had twisted, spiraling appendages.</p>
<p>Don stopped.</p>
<p>Zooming into a magical illusion cast by the enemy, a parade of the crowds from Sam’s time rang in Don&rsquo;s ear, turning the ground into another playground for his whispers. Cali’s long complaints about Sam echoed through Don&rsquo;s body with Birdie’s narration. Sam’s strange stare blew against Don until she was skinless. This imagination was a wet stain on her muscles, growing every time she imagined herself rubbing her skin.</p>
<p>Returning to reality, the forms left the scene, and Ritand sat up, pushing the blood off himself. He dried his hands with a cloth, imitating Don one time.</p>
<p>Don sat down and glanced at the adventurers, goblin workers, two goblins, mother and child, and Solvent in the distance.</p>
<p>She interlaced her fingers and grinded them back and forth, and, after a long mouth smile, put her fingertips together into a steeple.</p>
<p>She stood up and walked up to the cart, passing it and stopping in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>She tilted her head, raising her gaze from the ground toward the distance ahead of her.</p>
<p>Even after being unable to catch the enemy, Don only looked a little bothered.</p>
<p>Later, Solvent arrived, walked up to her, and said, “Are we leaving again, the Don?” She was sweating and pretended to be tired by panting because she didn&rsquo;t want Don to feel threatened.</p>
<p>Heading into a new stage, some time after this event, some of Solvent’s new members in the church asked one of the city officials if they could help sweep the streets with the older women.</p>
<p>Transitioning to the road leading inside the city, there, Solvent sighed, looking between Don and Orlanta City, which lay at the horizon.</p>
<p>Embarking on a metaphorical journey, the looping spiral of architectural comprehension welcomed the used coffee grounds. The coffee grounds provided the coffee plants their precious fertilizer. Solvent opened the gates and closed them, and she put the coffee grounds in sacks and removed them. The looping spirals were the gates, and the coffee grounds were the people: the gates and the people were the city. She said, “The city is right there.”</p>
<p>Falling back to the moment, Solvent looked at Don, curious.</p>
<p>Don stared long, ignoring Solvent and the city, imagining the horizon.</p>
<p>Progressing into the inner city, humans patrolled around with a troll there. “Helping is not obligatory,” said the troll, blocking traffic and directing the traffic to another road that he opened up. “I need every one of you directly combined with the small task force in Small Blithe.”</p>
<p>When Ritand cast the magical explosion, most of the inner city burned down, representing the loss of the city&rsquo;s first layer of skin.</p>
<p>Alongside this loss, opportunistic monsters from outside gathered around and replaced the gangs that fell apart. Adding to the chaos, bandits waited outside the city, offering a way for these monsters to get inside smoothly, and once the monsters took the bait, they robbed them.</p>
<p>In response to the chaos, the city authorities created many new provisional forces. As a result, the bandits stopped after only one day. Coincidentally, mage apprentices and squires practiced their hands during this time, being part of the forces.</p>
<p>Returning to Don, as she walked toward the city.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Solvent remembered her dream two years ago.</p>
<p>In this dream, she and Don fought each other. Don gave her a light slap and asked her what she needed to be strong. In response, Solvent threw out a flock of orbs from her rolling fingers and let them bloom in the whirls of the air and fade. She tore gasses from her mouth with her nails, letting the pressure explode. She tired and dropped to the ground, making a light hiccup. Don put each orb down and slammed her fists against the pavement, bringing the stones to slam against the orbs. She sucked the gasses that flew across his face, coughing them out until she laughed, roaring all the air out. Solvent died soon after.</p>
<p>Returning to reality, some time after Solvent and Don entered the city, many things occurred in different locations and times.</p>
<p>First, Solvent’s eyes moved from Don to small goblins. These goblins greeted humans and asked them about their opinions on clothing.</p>
<p>Second, Don could only have gotten stronger since then. She strided across the road and reached the city, towering above the guardstones of the gate. Her presence demanded a coalition against her, but she was too far from them to feel the pinches of one.</p>
<p>Third, Calli recruited, screened, and interviewed applicants from a human influx that Solvent provided.</p>
<p>Progressing to the fourth longer scene, Jared dropped by a shop and asked as he waved goodbye at the Don and the others. “Oh, dang, the prices have gone up. Is the price the same there?”</p>
<p>Calli glanced between him, Kyra, Algae, and Kloe. Algae exchanged four silver coins for lettuce and said, poking a curious child on the hands, “It’s somewhat thrice as expensive—” A mother shouted at him, telling him to stop touching her child. He apologized and bowed his head, grabbing his 10 bronze coins change. “It might be temporary because of the fire.”</p>
<p>“Fire,” Calli said, frowning, looking at Don. She thought Don might tell her about the fire since she told her that she killed Sam.</p>
<p>Kyra looked at Algae, asking him if he preferred people with children.</p>
<p>Algae thought she asked him if he felt a kinship with people with children. He nodded, having a goodbye with the child, hiding himself when he saw the mother glance at him. He had been entertaining the child before the mother finished her business with the vendors.</p>
<p>Jared poked inside one of the stores, finding an empty rocker. “I notice that some of these stories have weird scratchings. Do you guys see this in the others, too?”</p>
<p>Algae frowned and arrived first before Calli, who was busy asking Don about the fire.</p>
<p>Venturing into the fifth scene, Kloe was making his rounds when he saw a bunch of hare people gathering to demolish a house.</p>
<p>Sixth, a group of human contractors put down the last goblins in front of them. They tore through the books that the goblin warriors stole from their client by accident. Three goblins, friends of Birdie and Twerp, died.</p>
<p>Seventh, Solvent used the spell Heaven’s Joy and fractured the shields and armor until they fell upon the stalagmites that awaited them. She laughed, remembering the story Birdie told her about Calli. She burned the contractors, whose gambesons read “NCA,” and “Hellioawwerax.”</p>
<p>Eighth, Exterme was sitting down, waiting for his wounds to heal, remembering the quest that the hermit Don told them. He said the words: “‘Go to the city to the west, and I’ll reward you with a pretty heavy wand.’” Also, he remembered Algae, Kloe, and Jared’s words and actions.</p>
<p>“I should know that all hermits ask you to get something faraway as a last request,” he quoted Algae, imitating his movements when he said this, shaking his leg as if he had cramps.</p>
<p>“Assuredly, you know the foes of the hermits—the warlocks, remember?” he quoted Kloe. In imitation of him, he rolled his shoulders around and pressed against his waist, failing to crack his body when he twisted around.</p>
<p>“‘I wouldn’t know—’” he quoted Jared, imitating him by chewing on air, drinking from air, and faking a lame burp.</p>
<p>After doing this, he greeted a young man with uneven eyes.</p>
<p>Diving into the ninth scene, three hours ago, in the city Hereas, a young man lifted both whips of his hair back to its place, tearing open a large chest, leg pressed against it. He sighed and removed all the weight of his voice. “Howdy, little chesty. Make sure you’re tight and hungry.” He gave the mimic a light slap on the side. “Oy, I know you’re in there, Funny!” He already had a name for this random mimic.</p>
<p>The mimic felt the boot with cone-endings, metal straps around the middle, and a long blade jutting out from beneath.</p>
<p>The man kicked the mimic to the wall, jumped, and caught it. “Oh, silly Funny!” He ripped apart with his hands the mouth that had failed to open and dumped poisonous leaves inside. He laughed, watching as the mimic went ballistic and rolled around hoping for its tongue to get every inch of poison out.</p>
<p>He stopped laughing when the mimic threw its tongue and wrapped it around his leg. He cut it in an instant, putting back in its place his short sword. “I suggest you put that down, Mister.” He chewed his lip and squatted in front of it, leaning his head. He grasped it on the side and stared inside, caressing it up and down. “You need to stop and give me the core.” He whispered hushes and tight nudges along where its shoulders and back would be.</p>
<p>His voice turned to shallow breaths.</p>
<p>The mimic jumped and ran away out of the room and around a corner.</p>
<p>He laughed with giggles toward the end, his smile softening his masculine grippy features. He waved his hand from side to side, saying “Bye,” a poof escaping his mouth.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the mimic yelped after he turned another corner.</p>
<p>The human was in the distance in front of him, leaning the side of a knee against the wall, resting both hands on it, and stretching his other leg forward. His head pointed toward his other leg, and he eyed him, smirking, as a dimple formed on his face’s one side.</p>
<p>The mimic gasped and hyperventilated, running down a flight of stairs.</p>
<p>The human left the dungeon and appeared in front of a monster group, the weight returning to his voice. “It’s there, but I can’t beat it. Can you help me—”</p>
<p>A troll slapped him. “What is it with you?” she said, her voice mirroring that of a neglected child. “Respect those who’ve come to help you in the first place. Say ‘may!’ ‘May!’”</p>
<p>“I see.” The human, Hellioawwerax touched his face, tilting his head downwards at her necklace.</p>
<p>It shone bright every time its owner was emotional, and it wasn’t shining now.</p>
<p>“Good one!” He laughed, placing a hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>She kicked him on the balls and got one of the other monsters beside her to punch him in the face.</p>
<p>He fell to the ground, his body aching on the belly, sides, balls, and knees. “Ah, did it break?”</p>
<p>She raised an hatchet and hurled it down in an arc, stopping before it hit his face. “You see this. Beg.”</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry, let me just—”</p>
<p>“Beg!”</p>
<p>“Not sorry anymore—” He disappeared and appeared behind them with a mimic under his arm, looking at it. “Howdy, Funny. Howdy, Missus.” He grinned, his face red, but the mimic’s eyes redder.</p>
<p>The mimic lashed its tongue and broke their armor, as Hellioawwerax swooped in to unarm them from their weapons and shields. He jumped over them in a front flip, placed sticky glue where their limbs folded, landed with outstretched arms in a bow, and dashed away. “Hehe.”</p>
<p>The mimic jumped toward him, and he caught it in the air as he jumped, falling over the cliff. “See ya, major suckers for life!”</p>
<p>“I love you, little Funny. Remind me of this when I get old, okay?” He gave it a warm smile, making the mimic his little pet.</p>
<p>“I should really give you a hug.” His voice was distant as if he remembered something.</p>
<p>A dragon arrived to catch him, asking him about the rest of the monsters.</p>
<p>“‘They died because of their weakness’—” He laughed, interrupting himself. He patted the dragon and pointed a sword to the horizon, where they landed in a forest below them. He sang a song about the city mayor Sam, as the dragon finished flapping his winds.</p>
<p>A tall forest of trees that covered the sky welcomed him with melodies of the flapping of birds and the calls of animals of big and small. He shook with excitement, holding onto the dragon’s bone’s wing, bouncing with rotation.</p>
<p>The mimic struggled to get down, being careful as it edged its way.</p>
<p>He caught it, hugged it, and put it down, listening to the growing whispers of the forest. He gulped and looked at his dragon and then at the mimic’s back in front of him. He took a deep breath and sped up his walk.</p>
<p>He saw a small bouncy woman dancing in a clearing in front of him.</p>
<p>He frowned because he was thinking, but then, he smiled because he had an idea.</p>
<p>He cast a spell of protection for himself and had the dragon sit and watch. He brought the mimic with him and joined the woman, standing in front of her and starting with a kick to the left.</p>
<p>He danced, watching the slow fall of her arms as she spun and spun as her eyes locked with his.</p>
<p>He was amazed by how well she kept her gaze and applauded her, nodding, clapping, and saying goodbye to the mimic by tapping it.</p>
<p>He asked her, “Is the sun bright today? Or are you one of the forest elves?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Uh, I see, bright today, huh? He looked up where the clouds and the trees covered the sun. “W-what? You’re an elf?”</p>
<p>The elven woman smiled and nodded. “Yes,” she repeated.</p>
<p>“I see. How about this?” He handed her a large orb and deepened his already low voice. “Do you like orbs?”</p>
<p>The woman screamed.</p>
<p>She galloped toward the orb and swallowed it whole, choking on it.</p>
<p>He stared at her, glancing between her and the mimic walking up to his side.</p>
<p>She stopped choking and got the orb down in her stomach.</p>
<p>He puked and watched the ground turn purple and red.</p>
<p>The woman’s legs got taller, as her head reached higher and higher up up to the forest canopy. She manically laughed as her voice dried up, cracking and disappearing into nothingness.</p>
<p>He gave a nervous laugh and walked away, hiding underneath the dragon’s wing.</p>
<p>The woman swung her fist at him.</p>
<p>He caught it, but his hand slipped in a second, half-tripping.</p>
<p>The adventurer Exterme stabbed the woman, pulling her left and right and failing to kill her. He struggled to pull it out and stabbed her again on the cheek. He winced, running away when the woman clawed at him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bata and Ritand followed behind him, slumping down on the ground.</p>
<p>They had avoided talking and reacting to Exterme when they reminded him about the quest a long while ago.</p>
<p>Exterme grew frustrated, punching the woman on the cheek until she avoided his middle-finger punches.</p>
<p>Hellioawwerax took a deep breath and sat down a distance away from the woman, Exterme, Bata, and Ritand. He continued the song from a while ago.</p>
<p>Jumping to the broader level concluding these nine scenes, this was a very surreal, ambiguous, and disjointed series of events.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-1---troll-tycoon">Chapter 1 - Troll Tycoon <a href="#chapter-1---troll-tycoon" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="material-icons align-middle">link</i></a></h2><p>Don watched the sun falling down. The past events had been chaotic, but now she was relaxing.</p>
<p>Walking throughout the city, her movements were careful and discreet, but she knew that even with her attempts to be elegant, the lumbering form she possessed demanded her clumsiness and hard-hitting attacks.</p>
<p>Soon, she met one of her friends, a goblin named &ldquo;Bata.&rdquo; He was sitting down silently and not even giving her attention. He was bored because his younger brother was not here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; Don said, her voice quiet and brooding. It was a troll&rsquo;s voice, that of a terrifying nature. She kept her emotions under the surface, unable to communicate herself effectively with facial expressions and body language.</p>
<p>Bata raised his head, and then his eyes began darting around with hesitation before he lowered his head again, ignoring Don.</p>
<p>Confusedly, she said, &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bata looked around. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Ritand? He hasn&rsquo;t come back in a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don had began taking care of Bata and Ritand a long time ago, and even after becoming a more established part of the city, she still cared about them. She wanted them to be okay, and she didn&rsquo;t care about the many other people who had become a part of her life recently all that much. But if Ritand and Bata died, she would move on, because she was a monster. And monsters didn&rsquo;t feel anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s with my workers, as per usual.&rdquo; She was surprised he didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>After conversing for a while, Bata joined Don in heading to her new settlement.</p>
<p>Moving on to Don&rsquo;s current goals in mind, they included arranging the people under her authority, having equipped herself with various sources of power. Indeed, her next goal now was to expand through the dungeons.</p>
<p>Being a monster, it wouldn&rsquo;t be that hard to engage in warfare.</p>
<p>She wore a hermit&rsquo;s red and blue clothes and went out to the fields within the forest. Here, Don saw beauty in the moment. To name one example, the sun danced like lillies leaping with joy at the sight of the glorious light. Second, the sky moved along a narrow path, creating clouds that beamed magically to the horizon, casting magical shadowy effects upon the region.</p>
<p>Shifting focus to her people, they were goblins, and they were her workers, collecting resources slowly, providing her a gradual approach to understanding how to control her environment. But she didn&rsquo;t just have workers.</p>
<p>Relevantly, she marshalled her goblin soldiers, making sure they were paying attention in case a human adventurer party attacked them.</p>
<p>Zooming to a broader level, as a troll powerful enough to shake forests, her goal here was to complete her quest of understanding this world.</p>
<p>Currently, she was a level 15 warlock, one that had a lack of soldiers and still struggled to make ends meet. Indeed, despite her status as a powerful troll, her past decisions of betraying her former contractors had left her only with herself and a group of trusted companions to rely on.</p>
<p>Her goals for now were to recruit more goblin workers and soldiers and slowly level them up.</p>
<p>She went to a small lumberer&rsquo;s hut and told the goblin workers to sit down and relax here while she surveyed the area. In fact, she got the workers to survey as well eventually.</p>
<p>She selected two goblin workers in one direction and three goblins in another, having the rest in a third direction toward a giant mountain cave. She kept them in groups in case something or someone attacked them.</p>
<p>So when it came to her overall strategy or plan, it consisted of three aspects needing explanation. First, she had 26 goblin workers right now and 15 goblin soldiers, so in order to maintain tehse goblins, she had to have food resources and housing for them. The good thing was that goblins could sleep anywhere on cave floor. Second, she was a level 15 warlock, but her goblins all had different simple skills and levels. Therefore, she needed to check them periodically in order to have them distribute their unused stat points gained from leveling effectively. Naturally, this checking would also involve everything else about the stat [System]. When it came to the third aspect, she also had certain buildings and locations within her control, and sustaining them took effort on her own part. This was why she couldn&rsquo;t just progress without examining her encompassing operation and upholding its accompanying demands.</p>
<p>She checked the status page of one of the goblins by using [Identify].</p>
<p><strong>Level 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Range - 300 (1 meter)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Description - Gobby the Goblin. They found a spellbook one day and learned fire and ice spells. Now, armed with a wooden sword, Gobby protects the forest from Shadow Sprites, spreading joy on their adventures.</strong></p>
<p>This was her goal. This was her purpose.</p>
<p>She might have had a long history that she couldn&rsquo;t explain in a day.</p>
<p>But that did not matter. What mattered was that she could continue to create new generations that had it better.</p>
<p>The goblins were the troops, and they would be leveling up by themselves and growing like they were tycoons. Don would be the tycoon owner of tycoons in this metaphor then.</p>
<p>Anyway, after her goblins completed their search, Don moved to engage in slash-and-burn agriculture due to the density of the forest. With the help of her giant, powerful body, she looked to the mountainsides and wondered if she could create terraces due to the heavy rainfall found naturally in this tropcial region. She had learned about this from smart friends like Sam, someone who had sadly passed away some time ago.</p>
<p>Now that her goblin workers were slashing and burning, she selected her goblin warriors and had them continue patrolling around to gain vision and control of the area. This place had already been vision-checked before, but now that they were here. The goal was to clean up and establish more permanent control, which took a long time to start laying the foundations for facilities and various elements of infrastructure. This would pave the way for creating a small, budding tycoon community that would slowly accrue her money and influence while also leveling the community members.</p>
<p>Currently, she was thinking of obtaining a totem that was known to scare pests and critters away. But that would take a long time because it was deep in a dungeon.</p>
<p>However, she was strong, so she decided to delegate her role as leader of the community to one of her goblins and began visiting the cave.</p>
<p>The morning was quiet, enough to signal a new start, and diseases and damages from the day before were cured.</p>
<p>Despite already being healthy and missing the timing for this morning benefit, Don continued down the first floor of the cave, scaring off most wild goblins. But when it came to larger creatures like slimes and giant bats, she fought them for a while and gained XP toward her next level.</p>
<p><strong>Level 15 | 2/37 XP</strong></p>
<p>Killing a slime or a giant bat only gave 1 XP for her since she was already very strong as a troll and very high in level. The [System] penalized her for farming XP without looking for novel and more challenging fights, resulting in her only getting 1 XP.</p>
<p>But she was in the cave for a totem.</p>
<p>After locating the totem, she ran all the way back to the base because it had to be placed immediately, or else it would disintegrate.</p>
<p>After placing it down, the new community was immediately recognized by the [System].</p>
<p>You have established a new community. For your efforts, you will now be shown a new panel to control and monitor your community status better.</p>

<p>Her goal was to mitigate these risks and hopefully solve them before her community bit the dust.</p>
<p>As she began helping the goblins work, a man wearing a purple and yellow outfit scurried to the village before placing a bomb.</p>
<p>It exploded, shocking the rest of the camp.</p>
<p>Don began moving her reinforcements forward.</p>
<p>The bomb was followed by the emergence of a giant army. They wanted to rid this world of the Don, a threat that had showed signs of budding growth in the east of the human empire. So this was their hello, a way of greeting a potential threat from amassing enough strength.</p>
<p>Don did not feel anything.</p>
<p>Skills castrated her power, and they began attacking her, chipping at her health bar slowly, as she struggled.</p>
<p>A party of human adventurers entered the scene, being friends of Don. She had expressed indifference toward them, but she needed their help now.</p>
<p>Among them, Jared, Kloe, and Algae began shouting in chorus.</p>
<p>Moreover, a large number of goblins belonging to the extended family of Birdie, one of Don&rsquo;s former members, joined as well. They were here for Twerp, a friend of Birdie.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Exterme and his party were there as well, even if Don had a complicated history with him after he killed Birdie.</p>
<p>Two fishmen public servants, Kyra and Cali were also there. Kyra grabbed a weighty, disproportionate magical instrument from her pouch and activated it, buffing her fellow fighters with increased speed.</p>
<p>They swiftly frustrated the enemy attack and fended them off, forcing them to make a strategic retreat.</p>
<p>But they would soon return.</p>
<p>After the fight, Matthew and his friends who had come to save him had a feast to celebrate, as the night came to close. When it was morning, everyone&rsquo;s sicknesses, diseases, and wounds healed, encouraging them to keep growing as a team.</p>
<p>Exterme said: &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s going on, boys? I know it&rsquo;s been a long while, but let&rsquo;s just say that this has been the best time ever. I finally was able to use my [Rasungun]. Powerful skill really. Should&rsquo;ve given it to Mr. Martine, but hey, this is fine too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The personality switch weirded out the group, but they already knew Exterme was a horrible, disgusting weird person. The fact that he had helped them made that feel this side of him was more like a front than anything, but it was still hard to look at. But at least he was trying maybe.</p>
<p>In the end, the group, despite having gotten over a large barrier, still had to navigate the challenges and confusions inherent in their different personalities, goals, and styles of communication, among other things.</p>
<p>But it was nice to get together every once in a while.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Don&rsquo;s new settlement, since it blocked human adventurers&rsquo; path to the sea, was going to be targeted no matter what. That was why the friends that had come would stay, because they could get a lot out of this. The adjacent city would eventually begin showing support for Don&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Don would have to hurry up, because the many issues and unknowns in the background were creeping closer like minor enemies becoming stronger overtime when left unchecked. That was also the reason she was attacked today, because they wanted to check and test her, hoping to eliminate her at her weakest.</p>

She had to hurry up and get a totem again because the last one ran out immediately.</p>
<p>In the meantime, she looked at the new settlement&rsquo;s statue page.</p>

<p>Don visiting various places, using her connections to help bring some much needed provisions for the settlement&rsquo;s early phases. She got plenty of crops that she immediately had planted.</p>
<p>It was easy like eating freshly cooked meat on a summer day.</p>
<p>Her issues now were a lot, but for now, she would be talking with the individuals in her settlement to clear out any confusion.</p>
<p>She met one of the goblins, Zupupu, directing him toward a log.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know anyone here?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm&hellip; No—of course I know everyone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don shrugged. &ldquo;Okay, then, how about this? Do you know who you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zupupu&rsquo;s eyes lowered. &ldquo;I know myself more than anyone else, but what I want to know is why the heck are you asking me these questions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don gave a thumbs-up. &ldquo;Okay, next question, I want to know if you&rsquo;ve been eating anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zupupu ran away.</p>
<p>Don wiped the sweat off his forehead. &ldquo;Looks like this&rsquo;ll be a hard one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After interviewing each goblin, she then headed to the city and talked to an adventurer party called &ldquo;Saero,&rdquo; which included familiar friends such as Jared, Kloe, and Algae.</p>
<p>Jared stared at him. &ldquo;Don, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wondering if you guys need any help. I&rsquo;m not really forcing you, but I want to help. I want to help because my settlement needs more people, so if I was thinking that if I help, then more people would come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incomprehensible logic there Don, but that&rsquo;s better than nothing. Come on let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; Jared said, heading out and showing Don a dungeon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, so if you hit this dungeon really hard,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;It will explode.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don knew that, but she couldn&rsquo;t communicate well enough. That was her struggle.</p>
<p>Later, Jared showed Don various different items in a shop. &ldquo;Okay, before we head out, I was hoping to show you this. Get one of those clubs, alright? You like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don nodded, recognizing the power in sheer mass. &ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t fit my size.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, but I can get someone that&rsquo;ll make one of those.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shop keeper looked at him with a squint that said, &ldquo;You come here just to look at my items and leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anyway, the adventurer party and Don left to a tower where they met a bubbly little princess-like woman who showed them birds and various monsters in cages. &ldquo;W-why are you&hellip;&rdquo; she said, daunted by the size of Don. She was a female bird-man herself with a bird head, but even she found Don intimidating because of her gigantic stature. &ldquo;&hellip;here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don glanced at Jared, who said, &ldquo;We need a club. I know you have one of those. You use it to help the feedery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop calling it a &lsquo;feedery&rsquo;,&rdquo; the woman said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a feeding area, idiot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like calling it that, Marshall.&rdquo; He turned to Don. &ldquo;Her name is Marshall, okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don nodded.</p>
<p>The woman, Marshall said: &ldquo;I see now that you&rsquo;re trying to reveal all my details! I see now. You&rsquo;re trying to extort me and blackmail me, that&rsquo;s it! Mom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dragon appeared outside through a portal, transforming into a bird-man and then slowly climbing the tower.</p>
<p>After Don, the adventurer party, and Marshall awkwardly waited, the bird-man climbed the tower and entered the room. &ldquo;How are you guys doing? Want bibingka?&rdquo; said the mother of Marshall, carrying bibinka that she bought from a group of goblins. &ldquo;I was wondering if maybe we should visit the Leroy sometime. It would be nice to see it again, what d&rsquo;you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marshall, the daughter, nodded aggressively. &ldquo;Of course, I want to see it Mom, but Mom, they&rsquo;re trying to reveal my information to the public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mom snorted playfully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, dear. They&rsquo;re just playing around, and they probably want something, don&rsquo;t you boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jared nodded, saying yes slowly.</p>
<p>Mom laughed. &ldquo;I guess we can just leave then. I&rsquo;ll give you the club, and we&rsquo;ll be off. Toodle-oo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they climbed down the tower and went outside, she opened a portal and took out a giant club from her dimensional storage, handing it to Don.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don, it&rsquo;s nice to meet you. What do you think about Marshall? Hope she&rsquo;s not bothering you too much!&rdquo; She and Marshall, who was trying to shush her about revealing details about her, left.</p>
<p>Don and the adventurer party left, heading to a dungeon. &ldquo;Okay, this is where we kill things,&rdquo; said Jared, starting to bother Don.</p>
<p>Don might have been a troll, but she didn&rsquo;t like getting treated like she was unintelligent. Being bad at speaking and having a unique perception of life didn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that she was dumb.</p>
<p>At the dungeon, it was quiet, water dripping.</p>
<p>Don saw lush vegetation overcoming what was supposed to be a rocky cave floor. It smelled and felt like a bouquet with its freshness.</p>
<p>The wind moved flavorfully through the cave tunnel.</p>
<p>She went down the steps, accompanied by the small figures below her. These figures were the adventurers, who still had to be very careful around the giant Don, who was still a giant troll, no joke.</p>
<p>Well, after they all finished up walking the steps, it was bound for them to encounter one of the wraiths who spawned in the cave. It was a big place after all.</p>
<p>Don struck one of them, only to find her physical body passing through the wraiths, leaving it to the adventurers to try to fight it.</p>
<p>However, none of the adventurers had magic, so they decided to book it.</p>
<p>Don and the adventurers left the cave and looked for another place to enter that didn&rsquo;t have wraiths or ghostly figures. It scared them so much one of the adventurers peed himself.</p>
<p>It worried Don to see such fear from what were supposed to be adventurous fellows. She guessed that people like them struggled to relax in dungeon environments if they didn&rsquo;t have &ldquo;a perfect plan&rdquo; already in place.</p>
<p>The ghosts absolutely demolished their preparations.</p>
<p>Don arrived at one of the junctures between several points in the dungeon. Her voice was deep and menacing. &ldquo;Hey guys,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t actually know what they were supposed to be doing there, and Jared wasn&rsquo;t the type to betray her. So she wanted to ask only now just in case Jared thought she knew where she was going.</p>
<p>Jared said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly, but I know it&rsquo;s around here—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treasure?&rdquo; said Don, excited at the idea of finding treasure now that she was with Jared. This cave was big enough to fit her, but often times, she found tunnels that led to places she couldn&rsquo;t fit. And often times, these tunnels led to treasure chests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, we&rsquo;re expecting a rare bow <em>at least</em>!&rdquo; he emphasized that like it was festivities.</p>
<p>Don said okay.</p>
<p>It was not difficult to follow Jared, Kloe, and Algae, because they were very open around her.</p>
<p>Jared said, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be peeing here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kloe said, &ldquo;I will! I already did! Too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Algae burst into laughter.</p>
<p>The fact that they did this made her wonder if this world cared about them doing this so openly, or if they were they just weirdos.</p>
<p>It was hard not to hate people like these.</p>
<p>Inside the cave, the tunnels felt like they kept expanding, each leading to what felt like an eternity of doom and darkness.</p>
<p>They finally encountered an enemy, but it wasn&rsquo;t ghosts this time.</p>
<p>It was a bunch of rock golems, and that would have wiped out the adventurers if it wasn&rsquo;t for Don just blocking them with her body.</p>
<p>The golems were only 5 feet tall, so it wasn&rsquo;t a fair fight.</p>
<p>Don smashed them and didn&rsquo;t give the adventurers time to hesitate and make changes midstream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally,&rdquo; she said, watching the surprised adventurers.</p>
<p>They never got used to seeing her beat up things effortlessly, huh.</p>
<p>Well, she accepted that, realizing that this world rested upon her shoulders for her to take. People like her got what they got, and it was only natural for them to expand and develop the world.</p>
<p>As the fight ended, she noticed her XP increasing and her next level inching closer.</p>
<p><strong>Level 15 | 2.00000000001/37 XP</strong></p>
<p>It was only a 0.00000000001 XP increase, but she was feeling optimistic.</p>
<p>She noticed some of the adventurers starting to get confident. Well, happiness loved company.</p>
<p>She raised her arms in victory; hitting the cave ceiling and astounding the adventurers. &ldquo;Whoops!&rdquo; Her voice was even scarier.</p>
<p>The adventurers kept their distance, leaving Don to stare in silence. She felt embarassed, but it wasn&rsquo;t automatic for her to scratch her head or do some gesture indicating so. She was just bad at communicating.</p>
<p>But the adventurers managed with it, walking back next to her.</p>
<p>Jared redirected them to their reason for being here: &ldquo;Okay, so I know there&rsquo;s a treasure around here. If not, we can just go back. It&rsquo;s chill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don said yes, quietly this time.</p>
<p>When they turned the corner, the wraiths in the distance was enough to dissuade them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s leave everybody!&rdquo; said Algae.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright!&rdquo; said Kloe. Woohoo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guys, be quiet!&rdquo; said Jared before screaming as well, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were screaming for screaming&rsquo;s sake at this point—a bunch of hyper-excited man-children, but in a good way.</p>
<p>Don adored that side of them, her voice chirping affectionately like a demon with how deep it sounded: &ldquo;You guys&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After they left, Don parted ways with them and returned to the settlement, happy that her day was productive. &ldquo;Ahh&hellip; 0.00000000001 XP&hellip;&rdquo; she moaned in satisfaction.</p>
<p>The goblins glanced at her before returning to work, passing by a board that read all the problems of the village listed by the [System.]</p>

<p>Even now, it was hard to pretend that everything would go perfectly well.</p>
<p><strong>[One of your goblins had gotten sick! Go to them immediately!]</strong></p>
<p>Don ran and hired a healer from a nearby district to save the goblin.</p>
<p>The goblin didn&rsquo;t die, but that meant something moving forward.</p>
<p>Don decided to have healers at the city; however, she came to a problem.</p>

                content: " The book cover presents a vibrant scene reminiscent of a classic role-playing game. A charming, red-roofed building, likely an inn or shop, sits atop a floating island with a pathway leading down to a lower level. Several characters, including a young woman with red attire, populate the scene. Red triangles with exclamation points hover above the characters, suggesting alerts or warnings within the game’s context. In the bottom left corner, a red goblin icon with the text “x3” indicates a potential threat or enemy encounter. The name “Don” is emblazoned across the top in large, bold, red letters with a black outline, signifying the protagonist or a key character in the story. The overall style evokes a sense of adventure and lighthearted fantasy, inviting the reader to explore the world within.\nBook Description:\nThis story follows the powerful troll Don as she establishes a new settlement called Dontown and builds up a community of goblins, warriors, and soldiers. As a level 15 warlock, Don faces various challenges in managing resources, fending off attacks, and leveling up her community members, all while navigating complex relationships with human adventurers, fishmen public servants, and other factions. The story blends fantasy, RPG mechanics, and kingdom-building as Don works to expand her influence and create a safe haven for her people, while also uncovering darker forces that aim to undermine her efforts.\nSkip the prologues and head over to chapter 1 if you want to get right into the main story. The prologue just delves more deeply into Don’s perspective, so it is very fragmented and non-linear, characterized by non-standard use of words and unusual phrasing, and highly poetic and abstract.\n2100 words average; 2 PM CET\nPrologue (1): Boat Ride and Meeting Sam link Author’s Note\nSkip the prologues and head over to chapter 1 if you want to get right into the main story. The prologue just delves more deeply into Don’s perspective, so it is very fragmented and non-linear, characterized by non-standard use of words and unusual phrasing, and highly poetic and abstract.\nThis prologue leans toward a more fragmented, non-linear, and ambiguous style. It’s meant to provide vignettes and out-of-context scenes that will be explained in the main story. Though, prologue (1) to (3) is generally more linear in terms of writing style. The entire prologue may be skipped, since it will mostly be extra content rather than essential context. As for whether this prologue occurs before or after the main story, considering that the main cast is here, it occurs before the main story.\nTo start, a young troll, Don, squeezed in a boat, as she curled her lips inward and scratched her lower back.\nMoving on to a more abstract and figurative note, wood cracked into Don’s ears and sang a lullaby that turned her into a sullying quadruple; every rock of the boat syrupped her into a seething blaze of coarse flame and damning incarnation. The sky would tether them into the inevitable, trifling seat of the river’s bed.\nAnyway, Don said: “What’s with the small golem back there?”\nShe rubbed her chin. “Is it operational or something?”\nWhen it came to context, Don was a troll from a far land, and she was coming here to help a man named “Sam.” Moreover, she brought two young goblins, whom she had taken under her care. As for her role, being a troll, she was a powerful creature, and Sam, a hybrid between man and fish—a fishman—wanted her help in a coming fight. In conclusion, she was headed to the camp where Sam and his soldiers were, and the fight was about to begin.\nReturning to the moment, she played with a weighty, disproportionate, mechanical toy the size of her hand. The rubbing of her lips, like a grimace, fled into raised brows and a blown raspberry.\nDancing yet again into a more metaphorical and abstract tone, the night sky elated her like a molten skee across a dance of tulips organized in a heap. Her soul became uninhabited, dull like a stopped refrain.\nTo explain these abstractions, despite her seemingly dull and emotionally hampered demeanor, Don had a very vivid inner life, her internal complexities sundering each other and creating vast works of imaginitive artistry.\nBouncing back to the common level, a part fell from the toy Don held, dropping the ground, and the two goblins with her—Ritand and Bata—bent down to pick it up. All three of them were on the same boat.\nRegarding their subjective experience altogether, shining white lights blinded them, their moods in suspense at the edge of precipices and unresolved like tritone.\nMoving on to one excluding Don; Ritand and Bata imagined themselves like bats soaring and swooning after the birth of a crisp, elegant smile on Don’s face.\nCoincidentally, when they bent down and their boat rocked, they dropped the pocketed necklaces.\nThey gasped and scrambled to return it.\nIn the end, the night sky demanded their careful obedience to the endless abandon, time and place fifteen years in the past.\nHeading into a new phase, Don helped pick up the necklaces on the floor of the boat, smoothing out her sleeves and bending over.\nStretching focus to a larger view, their boat touched land between massifs between a deep valley on one of many white beaches. Faraway, rock outcrops, pinnacles, and cave systems made up this karst region.\nFalling back to the in-person perspective, after they crossed the beach, Don tsk-tsked, crouched, and grabbed a torch on the way into a tent.\nPlaying with a mystical vibe, Sam, a fishman, stood deep inside the tent, staring at the ground, fidgeting with his decorative gills. Second, a cup of bitter coffee dripped down his mouth and mustache: he drank anyhow. Lastly, he shook when he saw Don.\nHeightening the mystical aspect, in his head, Sam danced with the fairies as they pointed to his plan for the stone wall Don. Second, he twisted his torso and curled his head, his stomach lightening at the appearance of even an inch of the magnificent troll. Finally, the Arabica coffee by his side softened his gills and made the shadowed light like a soothing, sooting embrace.\nBringing the mystical quality to the everyday level, Sam pointed to his engraved wand containing mana crystal shards. “Pretty heavy.” His voice shook somewhat halfway.\nZooming to Don’s side of things, having only entered the cave, she flicked her finger against the toy in her clasped hands in a cursory, fidgeting manner. Then, he gave Sam a greeting stare.\nLowering to Ritand’s view, he said, pushing aside Don’s leg, “Get out of the way.\"\nWhen it came to Sam’s response, looking downwards, he raised his head, cleared his throat, and said, “Ritand, how sweet! Sick father, again?”\nStretching the view to include Bata, he and Ritand pointed their eyes at him, turning their heads toward the cages around them. Bata was holding onto Ritand’s shoulder.\nMeanwhile, Sam said, clearing his throat, wrinkling his nose: “My troopers… they’re working.” He followed Bata and Ritand’s eyes, looking at the cages as well.\nIncidentally, Ritand said okay, and Bata pushed the pouch of Ritand behind him, patting Don’s leg twice.\nWith her attention captured, Don turned around, sat on her haunches, and realigned Ritand’s pouch’s straps up and down until Ritand gave an okay.\nIn conclusion, not much was said, but Don, Ritand, and Bata were generally comfortable. Sam was making strange statements, but Don was in understanding. Though, she wasn’t exactly keen on establishing a long coherent discussion, so their meeting ended with not much said. However, they did already know what to do. The meeting was merely a formality, even if it had nothing to do with the word “formal.”\nCasting light on a new stage, later, outside Sam’s tent and at the camp frontline, Don sat down on a pair of piled logs, putting her foot against a pile of gravel. Ritand and Bata were nearby.\nDon pointed to the left, as goblin workers followed Don’s direction.\nBata cracked his fingers on one hand, using only the thumb of the same hand to do it, and walked in a circle. Ritand hugged a log and leaned down on it.\n“It’s…” Don imitated a clicking sound, stretched a hand backward, and turned her head around to stare at Sam’s tent. “…right over there.”\nBata rested his chin on his hand and squinted, as a bunch of fishmen passed by him. Ritand glanced at Bata and turned his head toward a loud thud. He got up from the ground and climbed until he was beside Don.\nIn the distance, six goblins carried a log that fell on their legs. Don dashed and helped these six goblins out of their predicament.\nSimultaneously, Ritand and Bata got off the log, as a host of figures wandered close to the site. The two goblins took a deep breath and sighed halfway.\nRiding onto a more tense mood, Ritand raised his brows and lip-pointed to them, shaking his hands. “It’s them—the warning!” he said, putting his cup down. As all of the other goblins strided along still, Ritand repeated himself, crescendoing at the phrase “the warning.”\nThe atmosphere taking a new shape, Bata lifted his head toward a meteor of smokeless fire blasting the camp’s most vulnerable side, his brows squinting somewhat. In the blast, screams pointed at the gory pastes of fishmen.\nIntroducing Don, Bata, and Ritand’s new enemies, in the distance, adventurers slid down the slope and overtook the half-armored goblins. They swung and clashed until these goblins hit the floor.\nFurthermore, they held back when they attacked and gave their all when they defended. They hoped that the goblins only died because of their bad falls.\nAs for the response of Sam and his men, the last fishmen came out of their tents and cast spells of ice that pushed back the adventurers until they retreated.\nThe fishmen gathered themselves and composed their spirits into one arcane blast of impaling halberds of ice.\nElevating their actions onto a more symbolic layer, their anger united them under a common banner of revenge.\nSwinging to the result of the fishmen’s attacks, soon enough, the impaled adventurers dotted the floor, as their bodies became a stench.\nTurning to something more disturbing than blasts of ice, the fishmen gathered the adventurers’ bodies and consumed them, shining with golden light for a moment. On another note, in blows of feet against the ground floor, they waved their hands and took sharp inhales.\nSimilarly, they each drank a mana potion, as they slung their heavy arms to cast the impaling ice, crying. The side effects of mana potions and their current emotion state combined to make them psychotic.\nAscending to a highly metaphorical domain, they felt the grace of gods pushing them to eradicate the enlightened species, the humans. An eagle spread forth above them and guided them toward victory. The light above became their love, and their love spread forth through magical, sickening gorges in front of them.\nIn that very moment, besides the dead adventurers, the living ones ran, but the goblins caught up on four legs and surrounded them. As a side note, they rubbed some dirt off their hands on their trousers.\nExpanding on the goblins’ ferocity, they edged closer every time the adventurers eyed the goblins’ weapons, fidgeting and twisting their body around.\nSeveral moments later, bringing Don into the stage, she placed her hand against the goblins as they fled, guiding them away from the adventureres’ arrows and blasts.\nIncluding Sam into the picture, she turned her head toward him as he fell. Behind the goblins, Sam shifted one arm forward and rubbed the elbow with his other hand. “What is it?” he said after he drunk a mana potion. Spreading attention to the background, a fishman flanked him a long distance away on each side.\nIn the same picture, Bata said, grabbing Ritand by the arm, heading toward Sam, “Don?”\nFocusing on Sam’s state after he fell, his mouth, eyes, cheeks, and nose turned still. His back became as straight as a stool.\nAdjusting to the larger background, the fight with the adventurers continued.\nMoving the mood to a lighter one, Ritand caressed Bata’s back and pressed him to do the same.\n“Sam, Sam.” Don steepled her fingertips against a potion on her thighs.\nBata said, “Look at their marks—”\nHe hoped that Don would be pleased with his performance.\nRitand said, “The birthmarks!”\nHe felt the same as Bata did.\n“Birthmarks? This is a high turnover,” Sam said, holding up steepled fingertips. He shouted an incantation: “Tier 2 Shock—”\n“Wrong spell,” Ritand said, placing his hand in front of Sam’s face and waving it. Because Sam canceled his spell, his stomach turned over.\nRitand took a deep breath, raised her brows hard, and locked eyes with Don.\nDon grinned.\nRitand smiled back, and Bata grinned with an open smile.\nA slow wail in the distance blared, as Ritand rubbed his hands together.\nDon closed her fingers and tapped Ritand’s shoulder and then his hands. He gazed at Ritand and shot the toy back to Bata. Ritand shoved Don’s hands off and threw out a thank you.\n“I’ll give you food later, okay?” he said, frowning on one side of his face.\nRitand curled his lips inward and twisted his head to the side, avoiding Don’s eyes.\nHe nodded.\nMeanwhile, on the safer edges of the battle, goblin workers grouped up on a large cart, some of them hanging to the side and back. They hurried out of the camp site to the closest city, grumbling and pushing one another. Moreover, one of them carried the name “Sicario,” who would play a role in Don and the two goblins’ journey later on.\nThey winced at the fishmen’s glances toward them every time they tapped their fingers on the weapons that they tucked away at the side.\nRecentering onto the middle of the brawl, goblin warriors fell to the ground, as the adventurers threw javelins and swung at them.\nThe goblin warriors hurled their handles back and forth, lodging their weapons into a whirl of sullying plumps. The adventurers danced in a mockery of javelins, tossing their torsos with the shots that they flung.\nThe youngest of the goblins fixed their simple bows in their sweat, shooting anyhow.\nThe goblins stormed into a human and skewered him with their silky whisks and sick tugs. The humans hurled the goblins off him and stuck around in a fight to the death, running off in a pike charge.\nIncorporating Don into this fight, she trudged forth into battle, raised her arms, and stood in the way. She was charging, and she put her cloaked hand over the face of the human the goblins targeted and flung him away.\nDon commanded the clouds forth to pull her into the fight. The load of castles sunk under her arms, as they transformed into hundreds of ships of stone. She beat her arms across the sea of muddy earth, hurling herself over the human’s face.\nShe submerged in his mouth a cloaked, feathery hand, choking him. Then, she swung him into the edges of her sight.\nThe human broke his back, as red liquid wet his palate.\nThe goblins congratulated, becoming a tapestry of thank yous.\nDon dismissed them with a wave, handling a wet cloth with her other hand.\nThe humans shielded the fleeing human whom Don had thrown. Moreover, they guided him into their breaking fold-like formaton.\nDirecting the spotlight to the broader fight, every time a goblin ate a blade with their body, these humans twisted and galloped, jerking off their halberds and swords to further effect.\nFor each dead goblin, an allied knife plunged into them, and an undead version of them rose off the inanimate ground, twisting its back.\nThe humans whirled their hands into waves of forward thrusts, as the ground listened to their incantations. Mud bursted from the ground, replacing the hard soil below it. Don hissed, trudging away to avoid getting caught.\nIncidental to this ongoing fight, goblin’s head covers fell into pockets, and necklaces were rotated so that they were at the back. Wool trousers took in most of the wealth.\nAnyway, introducing the leader of the adventurers, Solvent, a human raid leader, matched Don’s height shoulder-to-shoulder. At the moment, she dangled an oversized necklace above her shoulders. In the larger fight, she huffed each time she hit the goblin vanguards, blunting their shields and armor tips and edges. Overall, she represented the adventurers, but she was also her own person.\nBreaking new ground with metaphorical expression, the sky screamed into a radial platitude of sonnet winds at Solvent’s careful movements. The goblins hurled back and forth with the waves of her tingling sky of sword swings. Their metal crumbled under the weight of her composition. The necklace held over her the sky of self-abandonment and, yet, immortality.\nAs for her succeeding actions, Solvent said, “Tire them long enough.” She raised her head, eying the back of the goblins. She pressed two fingers across her forehead and slid them down to her nose, pressing it. She retracted her fingers and huffed, as her furrowed stare tightened further.\n“Go!” The monsters’ strongest, Don, threw her bare fist ahead, as Solvent swung, steering downwards columns of adventurers.\nSolvent slammed her fists as she ran.\nThe perspiring goblin frontline charged anyhow through the shrubby slope, holding somehow onto one another and the outcropping rock ledges and creeping figs.\nUnveiling magic in an immersive way, Solvent strummed up tiny orbs from her hands and passed them along the winds until they disappeared. A toxic gas leapt from her mouth, but she lost her energy to stand, finding a tiny hiccup flying from her throat. “Heaven’s Joy!” she said, her words inviting the magical winds and beckoning a spell’s appearance.\nAfter the able raiders got Solvent off the arrows’ trajectory, the air exploded in front of the goblins, signalling the completion of Solvent’s magic spell.\nPrologue (2): The Monster Trio’s Dealings linkWhen Solvent’s spell hit the air, she and the rest of the adventurers left the scene.\nSome time after the fight ended, goblins who had survived fight covered their faces.\nInvolving Don, Bata, and Ritand into this aftermath, they gazed at the falling goblins that had leapt back. They wandered around into their places, quipping at the messy dead.\nThey shuddered.\nThe goblin frontline bruised their buttocks when they fell earlier, and some of them had fractured a bone.\nThe monster trio, Don, Ritand, and Bata, put on their dry clothes and accessories and fixed them until they looked neat. Don was counting the casualties, placing down an empty potion. Ritand grabbed the potion and handed it to Bata, and Bata refilled it to half full with another potion.\nShifting to the decision of Sam and the rest of the fishmen, they left the authority to the goblin leaders and Don.\nSo Don followed what the fishmen did often in the past: she ordered them to cage the undead goblins. Also, she said that it was advisable for the cages to have food provisions and bags of deodorizing, used coffee grounds.\nAfterwards, they went home.\nAt the end of their short travel, their cracking home city gates welcomed them and bothered them with sour scents.\nThis opened up a new stage.\nTaking a look at what people in this city were like, most of them here lived according to what the newspapers said that the nobles were like. They were coffee-crazed, followed through with promises, each drank a teaspoon of red potion after work, and so on.\nAllowing a new perspective into the stage, a goblin worker, Sicario, who left early in the defense with the other workers, stood on the road to the right of the arriving party that included Don, Ritand, Bata, and Sam. He said, “The invaders have kneeled down and complied at our every advantage—” The plump goblins in front of him nodded, rubbing their hands together and embracing one another.\nSam heard the word “ambush” from Sicario to describe what they did to the humans and hesitated, glancing between himself and the goblin warriors with him in the cart. “No.”\nSicario leaned forward, grabbed a dagger on the ground, rolled his head to the side, and rushed away. He came back and handed an old manuscript which he had been hiding inside a small gap in the wall beneath a window frame.\n“The meeting engagement had its place,” Sam said, giving a furrowed stare at the goblins pointing their fists at Sicario.\nShifting view to his mind, he organized his thoughts and filed them under specific details in his memory cards. He felt secure in this mind chamber.\nTaking focus to the background, a crowd had gathered in front of Sicario and the rest of the arriving party.\nHe put his voice down on the heads of the crowd in front of him as he would with a table: “Yes, the meeting engagement began with the search party we sent in hopes they found an enlightened traveler.” Sam shifted his clothes to fit and his smile further up at the ene of each sentence.\nThe congregation listened to his words and acknowledged his report.\nTucking this scene into a corner and transitioning to a new, different segment, to Sam’s left, deep in a narrow alleyway, the monster trio—Don, Ritand, and Bata—murmured among themselves as they snickered. They handed it over their damaged items in bags to Kyra, a helmeted public servant inside a guild. They exchanged items through a barred window at the front of a long line of plump goblins.\nTaking a further look at these goblins, they were wiping their sweat away and pointing their fists toward the distance. Some of them wanted the rainy seasons to come.\nAnyway, the monster trio thought about a funny connection and wanted to keep enjoying themselves after the boring or tiring fight. Continuing the inclusion of Kyra, the public servant, who was a female fishman, emptied her mind every time that she felt stressed about a faraway but crucial human war.\nShe threw away the smallest scraps at the bottom of the bags, closing the door on a collection of trash. She said, “Having a lament in a party?\"\n“Problem? said Don, accepting a pouch of cash from Kyra. “Do you feel enlightened after taking this job?”\nKyra shushed him, and another fish person Cali answered her. Cali had passed behind Kyra and was plumping down dugout chests beside a door. What Cali said was, “Is your orders here by now—”\nShifting to this new person’s thoughts, Cali wanted to get out of move to the city away from these slums, but her father wanted her to stay humble. Her father meant that he wanted her to work under Sam instead of a more popular candidate for nation president.\nAnyhow, Kyra thought that Cali needed a break after seeing her carry the chests.\nTraveling back to an earlier scene, before the monster trio came, Cali leaned against a table and sat down with a weird posture to deal with the back pains.\nIn the present, Kyra was remembering this scene.\nIgnoring Don, Ritand, Bata, and the rest of those in line, Cali watched the gold coins scattering across the floor from the chests. They had fallen while Kyra was in a contemplative mood.\nKyra picked them up two by two and sprayed them across with her sanitizing magic. Some of the coins rolled out the open door.\nPivoting to the two young goblins’ entrances, Bata grabbed these outside coins, coming inside, while Ritand patted Bata on the side and told Kyra to straighten up.\nBata asked Ritand to use magic to wet his hands.\nRitand shook his head, but he obeyed anyway.\nBata put his hands against Ritand’s back and continued massaging him, following him around.\nCuing in Kyra, she squinted, raised an eyebrow, and winced at Ritand’s light slap to her back, as she straightened her back.\nShe took a pursed-lip sigh, as she listened to Don mumbling “Sam.” Don handed her a magical instrument alongside a summary report paper that Kyra folded and tucked under her arm.\nAfter checking a few papers and answering interrogatory questions, the monster trio left the office.\nChanging to the outside, at their left, boats lined up behind buildings and on the edge of a levee alongside a river, acting as a wall that broke the waves. Moreover, cobblestones and boulders piled up throughout them; one of the boats had a forest growing on it.\nEventually, having gone a long distance from Kyra and Cali’s workplace, Don, Bata, and Ritand slipped inside an inn far from the river, where they slept in their dried sweat.\nThis sleep lasted 4 hours.\nWhen Ritand and Bata woke up some time later, they found Don imitating a voice crack as part of a joke story at the inn’s bar counter. She was placing a small mug in front of her when Ritand pinched her on the arm. She retracted her arm and placed the mug down to her left. Incidentally, a mother and a child entered the inn.\nAs for Don, she made many mistakes since she woke up. And one of them was standing up abruptly and spilling her drink after a bartender put two mugs next to her arms. She apologized and handled the payments, glancing between her money and the mother and child. They approached Ritand and Bata, but the young goblins ignored the mother.\nRitand asked Bata about what they were going to do next, staring at a green mountain.\nAs he shifted the pouch of Ritand behind him, Bata smiled, touched the bottom of Ritand’s pouch, and said, “If he was here, how do you think he would react?” His tone shifted from somewhat abrasive to delighted.\nBata remembered their horrible parents because of their excitement for traveling.\nBata and Ritand knew they were in their twenties, but they would rather live a simple, carefree life like children.\nRitand looked at Don, who finished getting his money and handed it over to the mother. She bowed his head after he learned her ethnicity from her features.\nRitand wanted Don to stop helping people if that meant she would finally stop feeling her absurd guilt.\nMeanwhile, the mother imagined the future where she was a spirit and could only watch her child struggling to survive.\nReturning to the monster trio, when the two goblins finally went outside, Don rushed out, following them.\nThere, Ritand stretched backwards and stared down at a food shop.\nDon tucked inside Ritand’s pouch a pamphlet from the hare people and asked, “Should Georta be spoken with your cousins?”\nBata said “Yes,” and Ritand nodded his head, turning his head elsewhere.\nDon inquired more about the language, asking what words meant.\nSoon afterwards, Ritand rubbed his hands together, as Don looked toward a slow wail in the distance. This combination of Ritand rubbing his hands and a slow wail signalled another shift in the direction of their journey. As for the reason of their next action, it would be revealed a little later.\nRitand blasted the corner of a shop, making it like a smokeless fiery furnace. A familiar mother and child in the shop dropped backwards, leaning toward a hiding place.\nRitand studied the crowd: goblins, fishmen, trolls, and hare people. The goblins in the crowd grabbed the trolls’ long arm strong hairs and leapt from troll to troll. The fishmen rode carts, and the hare people were like vehicles, crawling through the streets.\nAfter Don had saved the mother and child and wet their clothes with a red liquid, she handed them a cloth. She dashed past and below the goblins hanging on the trolls that trudged through the streets.\nDon pushed through the crowd, looking behind her at Ritand, Bata, the mother, and the child. He gave a thumbs up, to which the child waved.\nDon smirked, fading in the distance.\nBata’s head wandered toward Don, but he was too late to see her.\nMoving to Don’s spirit, thunderstorms and hail clashed inside it, as her feelings dripped against the pavement. She fell backwards and spilled these staining feelings, watching as her hands smudged against the floor. She was standing up again, and her mind was a maelstrom, a disaster upon the street walls and the nightly storming of the crowds.\nRipping this imaginitive sequence apart and jumping to the action, Don fell over.\nFar behind Don, Bata put one hand on Ritand and hardened his hand, watching a mass of smokeless fire continue down to the inner-city. The centre of the fire faded away, as Bata was huffing, yet the fire was raging on. “Squatters’ area,” Ritand said, pointing at the wet market and the slums.\nA host of shields appeared everywhere, as people watched the strongest among them take control of the commotion. The strongest was a familiar human face, Solvent, who cocked her head at Ritand in the crowd and gestured toward Bata with complicit understanding.\nMarking a new, bold step in their journey, Ritand and Bata nodded at Solvent, staring at a muddy hole where one of Solvent’s comrades, a human, crawled out. He asked Ritand and Bata for help in coming out, wearing helmets and many layers of clothing.\nHe grabbed Bata and Ritand’s hands, and with Ritand’s lift, he tumbled inside Ritand’s pouch that held more than it looked. “Yeah, that’s her,” Ritand said vaguely, curling his lips.\nThe human thanked him, as red potion liquid wet his palate, healing his wounds.\nRitand grabbed the human’s peeking leg and pushed it back in, chewing his lip.\nWhile this was happening, on another side of the city, a wagon, rubbing around his mouth until his moustache became dry, Sam said, “‘The two rugrats are there.’” He nodded and released a human prisoner, ignoring the prisoner’s heroic claims.\nElsewhere, closer to Don, Bata, and Ritand, Solvent swung in the streets, steering downwards columns of adventurers, directing them to fight.\nReturning to Sam, in the blurry distance of Solvent, Sicario, a human that had disguised as a goblin worker, arrived with Sam. He asked, “Do you want her as the next top executive?”\nSam laughed. “What, like little Exterme? No one can be me. I have to do this.” He put his hands on Sicario, taking the dagger out of his pocket and placing it in his hands.\nChanging to an aggressive tone, Sicario leapt through the crowd to Solvent, grabbed her leg, and stabbed at her. “Sam wants you dead!”\nMoving away from this temporarily, at the back of the crowd watching the commotion, Kyra sorted through her pouch and raised a weighty, disproportionate magical instrument. With dark circles around her eyes, she shook the mechanical toy, hyperventilating.\nAdvancing to some time after Sicario’s confrontation, he saw an insect flying in his peripheral view, and his eyes unfocused and refocused at the faraway Kyra.\nNearby, Solvent had fallen to the ground.\nSicario gained a new spell and added it to his inventory of spells. He imagined a grandiose future for himself and smiled, having removed Solvent as a posed danger.\nHe filled her up with toxic gas, turning away to the crowd and saluting.\nIn the meantime, Sam appeared from behind Sicario, setting himself down on the edge of a platform. Sicario dropped off it and dashed out of sight, sustaining his salute.\nReverting to Don, who had been in the scene the entire time, being an ally of Solvent, Don got out from the crowd behind Sicario and being both out of sight, bludgeoned him to death.\nEarlier, Don felt that she found her opportunity. She wanted to get by like this, waiting for a random moment to strike.\nShe got lucky maybe, but if this worked her entire life, she was sure that this was right.\nWith Sicario dead, Sam’s goblin workers leapt to stop Don, but she was too strong.\nWhen Sam turned the corner with the intention of reuniting with Sicario, Don grabbed and pushed him to the ground, breaking his arms and crushing his chest.\nSam yelled and screamed until he shrieked. He lost his life midway.\nIn the end, Don was huffing, studying Sam’s body, having defeated Sam’s workers. She knew Sam was coming, so she ambushed him.\nStarting a new journey, Bata and Ritand arrived and edged toward Don, asking her if she was okay.\nDon raised his brows, still staring at Sam.\nWhen Bata stood shoulder-to-shoulder, Don turned his head at Bata’s face.\nBata yelped, leaping away. Ritand caught Bata, asking Don what was going on.\nDon stared at him in silence. She walked away, watching the goblin workers shriek when she came close. The strongest among them were too injured to do anything.\nDon left the streets toward the gates.\nBata and Ritand followed him.\nThey wanted to know if Don did this because of her plan. They knew Don hid some things from them, especially her plan, but they wanted to know if this was what was supposed to happen.\nDon stared at the ground as she walked over the uneven road, going around and jumping over potholes.\nHowever, reintroducing Sam’s bandaged goblin warriors from the fight with the humans, they emerged and went in front of the monster trio, blocking the way.\nDon gestured for them to move, glancing between the roads in front of her.\nThe bandaged goblin warriors asked to join Don.\nDon glanced at Ritand and Bata.\nThey knew what to do.\nPrologue (3): Don’s Assault and Aftermath linkBata went in front of the goblin warriors who had declared allegiance to Don and ordered them by their features.\nRitand asked for them to remove all their things except their clothes and put their things into his dimensional storage pouch.\nMany days later, Don sent two goblins out of the forty to work with Kyra and Cali. At the public servant office, they took on basic requests like carrying dugout chests and other items of significant weight.\nThe two assigned goblins, Twerp and Birdie, improvised a song about Sam’s fall. Twerp handed to Birdie a mechanical toy that had fallen from the office counter in the night. Kyra put each of them under direct management of Cali, who swore that her father sent them to her.\nTwerp wanted to make sure his small duty made waves for Don, whom they described as a troubled leader.\nIt was Ritand who handed them documents on how to handle Kyra and Cali.\nWhen they opened the documents, the only thing that read was “Don’t tell them about this, but please get me a small mechanical toy from there.”\nBirdie told Twerp to ignore Ritand’s requests and focus on getting Kyra and Cali whatever help they needed. Don made sure he funded them enough to enjoy themselves and start a business.\nTwerp looked confused most of the time. This made Kyra give him the most physical work, while Birdie got some time to learn his hand at calligraphy.\nBirdie put each word into perspective, grabbing the small parts of it and turning it into a spell.\nHis mana was insufficient for a spell, and even if he threw money at the papers, his improvised spells failed to manifest.\nTwerp operated on every muscle in his body, imagining how far and wide his reach could be if he had a magic for it.\nThese two goblins had similar dispositions with the rest of the goblin race toward magic and humans.\nTwerp reified this disposition through creating a small mana potion with Cali after she showed him the way to combine the elements.\nBirdie wanted more out of his daily activities as a public servant’s assistant. He asked Cali who Kyra’s “employer” was. He meant “the employer that directs her and tells her what to do in her life, not work.”\nCali pointed to the memorial outside of the city mayor Sam. She said, “Sam was also my father’s ‘employer.’”\nEarlier, Don sent Ritand and Bata to the office.\nBy the time they arrived, it was right after Cali pointed at the memorial, where the two young goblins were walking toward her.\nThey met Birdie first outside the office.\nRitand said, “Have you done your trivial assignment?”\nBirdie raised a brow and got Twerp to come out.\nTwerp looked at Birdie and imitated his expression of disappointment. “Why did you come?” he said, his voice somewhat tired but excited to humor himself and those around him.\n“I needed a little bit of that help for a grand project with the… big bad.”\n“‘The big bad?’” said Solvent, putting one foot in front of her before leaning against a wall that retained a small forest. “That’s Don, isn’t it?”\nTwerp observed the clashing expressions of the two goblins and Solvent, nudging Birdie for them to leave. The two goblins left and continued their tasks, stopping Kyra from inquiring about the three outside.\nSolvent put down her crutch and asked: “Is Don still alive? Sounds like it.” She had a smile that fit the V-shape in her armor. “She’s a she, right?” She laughed too long for it to sound genial.\nTwerp peeked from a window, making sure that his whispers to Birdie were dead silent. “What’s up with the tall human in Orlata City?”\n“Don is a shell of imperviousness, and her spirit forbids all infiltrations.”\n“Eh, tough times we have here—”\nMeanwhile, nearby, having lived through the assassination, Solvent stomped her foot forward and then stayed standing.\nAfter a stare between the two shaking goblins and the raid leader, Solvent fell to the ground, slamming against the pavement.\nShe cursed, asking the two for help.\nTwerp and Birdie came out to help her get up.\nRitand held onto Solvent’s hand and pushed her back down. “How’s that for a beatdown—”\n“W-what is this?” Kyra asked. Cali followed and inquired the same.\n“I assuaged Solvent’s deep threats against the Sam memorial right here,” Birdie said as he read Ritand’s intentions from his face. He had listened to Ritand explain before the two public servants came.\n“Where is this Solvent? This?” Cali stepped in front of Kyra and held up Birdie’s skirt.\n“Excuse me?” Birdie was half-laughing. He moved his skirt out of the way and gestured toward Solvent. “Pile of dog water fell from the sun.”\nSolvent had a blank expression on her face, as she stared at Birdie and then at Cali and Kyra. “Not a nice way to go about this.” She stood up, supporting herself with her crutch again. She chuckled when she half-tripped, taking in the pitying expressions around her. “Stop, stop.” She was smiling, and then, she frowned. “Stop. Too long. Manners, manners.”\nCali put her hand on her hips, bringing Kyra back inside. She gave Birdie and Twerp a meaningful glance as she left.\nTwerp’s mouth was agape, and Birdie wanted to ask Don who Solvent was.\nSolvent half-smiled.\nCali and Kyra were quiet and finished their business, coming out a few hours later.\nThey went down the street, passing the road as lizard-drawn carts and hare people made up the only official vehicles.\nCali and Kyra separated ways, as Cali hurled herself down a flight of steps and landed on the bottom with her legs fine.\nShe opened a door and spun her way inside, looking at the fishmen younglings sleeping in different corners of the room.\nCali lost the flow of her father’s money when Sam died. Moreover, she lost the properties that her father dedicated to Sam and would pass down to her.\nShe wanted to start again as someone else now that her father stopped paying her to work at the office. She had learned that her father only found a hopeless future after the assassination.\nShe remembered the two goblins and their dedication to their small work. She asked them the first time they came why they were here. Birdie said: “Don has everything prepared for us. All one needs to do is receive it.” Twerp was like “What he said.”\nWhen it was still dark in the morning, she traveled through many social paths outside of the city to the foot of a cave. She remembered that Twerp described Don’s presence as brooding. She brushed her thoughts aside and reminded herself to focus on getting everything out of the way. She took opportunities: sometimes, these risks failed like the one her father offered her.\nShe wanted to know if this one would kickstart a better life for her. Her children had to wait for her to get strong before she could teach them how to be strong.\nShe looked inside the cave, seeing a bunch of goblins telling each other spooky stories.\nThe goblins stood up, naked and barehanded.\nShe screamed and ran around, jumping around until she leapt from the cave and past the trees.\nShe returned, staring at the goblins who stared back at her.\nShe asked them about Don.\nThey turned around as they sat on their boulders.\nOne of them was Birdie.\n“I’ve been expecting you,” he said, smiling with his cheeks dimply.\nShe muttered a curse and trudged forward. “Why,” she said, “did you not give me any information that could have made sure I did not fall, trip, or die?”\nBirdie’s expression became awkward.\nHe thought that Cali would learn how to navigate this place as he did. “Did you get lost?”\n“No. I saw more than 10—15—goblins staring at me. So close to catching me!”\nBirdie gave a nervous laugh and led her inside.\nDon was somewhere there, standing up and reading a doorstopper book. “Why would I?” she said, asking Solvent.\n“Were you not supposed to ‘die’ with me?” the raid leader said, holding the hand of one of the adventurers under her. This adventurer underling was shaking.\n“Ah, I see,” said Cali.\n“Dysfunctional relationship,” Birdie said.\nCali gave him a confused stare.\nBirdie scratched his head. “You’ll see what I mean.”\nDon stopped talking when she noticed Cali.\nCali saw Solvent and said, “Oh, that crutched—”\n“Crutched? Please get your words right, ma’am.” She gestured to herself standing up and dashing around.\n“You. Lying?”\n“I did, not for bad reasons, you see. I love helping others, don’t I, Don?”\nDon was rubbing her chin, looking to the left past Solvent at the wall.\nSolvent gave a nervous chuckle and pointed toward a seat in the far left of Don. “Sit there, Cali.”\nCali gazed at Birdie.\n“Cali, yes, all accounts point to that being her name, most certainly,” Birdie said, losing his voice projection. “Wow, who has the answers to such a phenomenon?” He cleared his throat.\nCali turned away.\n“Excuse me,” Birdie said. His tone was quiet and serious.\nDon watched the small goblins converse with the human. Behind her face, she was thinking about where they should drop in the middle of the human war.\nEventually, their conversation ended on an open-ended note, allowing time for their relationship to grow naturally. Don’s goal here was simple—to keep his current position clear and safe from disruption and scrutiny, especially since he was the one who had killed Sam. But even the wounded goblin warriors didn’t know that. Indeed, Birdie and Twerp had no idea about Don’s murder of Sam and Sicario.\nPrologue (4) - The Hermit’s Task and the Mimic linkMoving on to a new stage, a small group of human adventurers passed by Don’s cave.\nThey wanted a good look at this small cave system in the mountain. It was far enough from Orlata City, a different city from the aforementioned one, and close enough for a three days’ travel on horseback to and fro.\nFurthermore, one of them had signed themselves in Solvent’s church. She was an official there that made waves under their nation’s National Commission on Adventurers. This paved the way for their eventual alliance with Don.\nSo Don came into an agreement with them to pay them handsomely whenever they came to clear monsters unrelated to her and her associates within her cave system.\nAs for why the adventurers teamed up with Don, one of the reasons included her disguise. Specifically, her disguise was a hermit mage. She even played the role of a storyteller. On top of that, Now Don’s committed ally, Solvent, had arranged it so that the adventurers were well-fooled to believe that Don was known in this area.\nIn the meantime, Bata arrived with the two goblins Birdie and Twerp at Orlata City. Back at the cave, the rest of the goblin warriors were reading books about history, and Don was giving them quizzes. After every quiz, she let them take a break to hunt to get their fill of the day.\nEventually, while all of this was happening, the humans attacked Bata, Birdie, and Twerp and put them in cages. They were current outside Orlata City and had set up camp.\nWhile imprisoned, Bata played with his mechanical toy, while Birdie and Twerp sang songs: “Go to the city to the west, and I’ll reward you with a pretty heavy wand.”\nThree members of the adventurer group turned left and right and asked one another what city he was talking about. They were confused and could only assume.\nThese three stayed behind, while the rest of the members of this adventurer group went down the path to Orlata city, entered it, and prepared to sleep there. They stayed at the foreign inns and ate the monster cuisine there.\nOne of the three adventurers remaining in the camp, Algae said, “I should know that all hermits ask you to get something faraway as a last request.”\n“Assuredly, you know the foes of the hermits—the warlocks, remember?” said Kloe, the other adventurer beside Algae.\n“I wouldn’t know—” said Jared, the one in front, finishing a mouthful of banana cue. He drank from a pouch of water and burped. “Excuse me.”\n“Yeah, right…” said Algae, looking between himself and the hermit striding toward them from the darkness. He nudged Jared and Kloe, cursing. “Is that…?”\nHaving come a long way from Sam’s city—Promise City—Don, in her hermit form, removed her hood and revealed herself.\nFrom the adventurers’ perspective, a moment ago, they saw the hermit, and now, replacing the hermit, a troll stood between the adventurers and the way back to Orlata City’s gates, blocking their way. This was a big development for that, and they could only stare and watch. For context, they stayed here to relax at the camp, preferring a station closer to the dungeons, caves, and wilderness. This made it easier for them to move around between the city and their priorities. However, this proved now life-threatening with the rare troll hopping into their crib.\nSqueezing into Don’s mind, she grunted, asking them if they saw the two goblins Birdie and Twerp, looking for the cages. She had come here with the help of a teleporter mage, but that costed lots of money. So she didn’t want to do it again. The reason she knew of Bata and Ritand’s absence was because of a skill that tracked them and their wellbeing. This way, she knew exactly their status and whether she needed to come help.\nWith that said, entering into a previous unresolved event, the late Sam was unprepared to deal with Don enough that she could get away with killing him, Sicario, and many of his goblins. Indeed, his life had been in her hands ever since he began to put her on the frontline and in the tent, or the equivalent thereof, where he practically slept; having trusted Don as Solvent did. It had been a power struggle between the two, representing different sides, human and monster. Solvent was supposed to die to Sicario, or at least that was what Don planned. But she lived, while Sam died—an imperfect conclusion, but one that Don didn’t find a reason to correct afterwards.\nRegarding Solvent’s case, her adventurer members had all died for her sake. So she had nowhere else to turn to, except Don. She didn’t want to return because that would be humiliating. It was much more easier to confide in an enemy-turned-friend than a friend with whom one had a long history with enough that any revealed humiliation would only cause her hopelessness and anxiety.\nIn conclusion, Sam and Solvent’s lives fell into Don’s palm because of how greedy they were to get an upperhand. That was why they lost everything. This was Don’s divide and conquer strategy, one that Ritand and Bata had yet to recognize.\nReturning to the confrontation between Don and the adventurers, now that she was here, they were hyperventilating, overshadowed by Don’s massive, lumbering yet limber form.\nThe nine-foot-tall troll was in the distance in front of them, leaning against a tree the side of his knee, resting both hands on it, and stretching her other leg forward. Her head pointed toward her other leg, and she eyed them, grunting, as a dimple formed on her face’s one side.\nThe adventurers knew that the monsters reputed the trolls to be calm. However, among the humans, they were known to chase down their prey. They were more endurant than humans and any other studied humanoids.\nWhen the troll stepped forward, she discovered RItand and Bata peeking from behind a log and a boulder.\nAlgae shot an arrow on the ground in front of the scurrying goblins. “Don’t,” he warned the two goblins. The arrow splintered after it slammed against rock, one of its splinters injuring Ritand.\nBata said, “Got it.” The two goblins hopped off the slope and fled away.\nRitand asked Bata for something to cover his wound.\nBata handed him one of his toys. “I only have this,” he said.\nRitand scratched his head, using the cloth parts of the toy to wipe the drips of blood.\nBata began moving around the fight until he was behind Don.\nDon responded with a long, hard stare.\nAlgae raised his arms to shoot.\nDon shook his head toward the adventurers, making a warning.\nAlgae’s arms froze.\nKloe lowered Algae’s arms along with the bow, pointing his shield at Don and the running Bata in the distance to make Algae focus.\nHaving contacted the other goblins at their base with a magical artifact, Bata joined Don and Ritand and said, “The goblins are asking for you. Should I tell them ‘no’?”\nWithout warning, Don sat on a log and leaned his leg against a pile of gravel. “I can talk. Please.” He lowered his head and raised open palms.\nKloe almost removed his shield, but Jared stopped him, shaking his head. Jared said, “Why are you guys blocking the way? What did we do to you?”\nHis tone was aggressive, but Don’s overwhelming presence kept him flexible.\nWhen one of the goblins offered a mechanical toy, he found himself forcibly laughing. “This is…” he said, noticing Kloe’s concerned expression.\nWith this shift in tone, Algae put his bow back in its strap. “I have things to do,” he said. “If this isn’t what I think it is…” After realizing the possibility of his statement being misinterpreted as aggressive, he tried to lighten the mood, pointing at the small shrubs beside Don jokingly. “I’m going to be eating that, okay?”\nJared chuckled again.\nMysteriously, Don sat up, went over a log, and left.\nBata and Ritand handed Jared the pamphlet from Don, who gave them the agreeing eyes.\nThe adventurers and the monster trio parted ways on a strange note.\nLong after this encounter, returning focus to Promise City, Birdie and Twerp left their small office, saying goodbye to Kyra and Cali. They fidgeted with the mechanical toy that Ritand requested, complaining a customer or two. By the time they reached the city gates, they were guffawing about weird customer they had.\nFurthermore, Solvent adjusted her girdle, seeing Birdie and Twerp turn a corner. “Hello, hi. I might have had a little call about two goblins taking a little too much time in the city.”\n“No, Don told Bata to tell us that Kyra needed more time with—” said Twerp, bending over to brush the mud off his leg. “Either way, what is it, again, Birdie? What else did he say?”\nBirdie said that he forgot, shushing Solvent before she spoke again.\nSolvent stopped insulting them and left them to their themselves, continuing her rounds in the inner city.\nResuming Birdie and Twerp’s journey on the road outside the city gates, when they passed by a group of adventurers, Birdie saw a hare person sitting in front of Ritand in the distance. “What is Ritand doing—” Birdie said, holding up his mechanical toy and sliding from side to side.\n“‘Ritand,’” said Exterme, one of the younger adventurers, trudging up close. “Is the troll Ritand? What is it?”\nBirdie raised a brow, chuckling. Twerp stood behind Birdie, studying the hare person.\nExterme stopped his scoff by clearing his throat; instead, his lip curled, and his eyes glinted with a sardonic rage. His mindset had taken a downturn after he lost a good deal with the city mayor Sam after he died.\nHe unveiled a dagger strapped to his waist.\nUnaware, Birdie lowered his arm to his side, saying, “Yeah.” He hesitated, prolonging a vowel. He nudged Twerp on the lower back with his other arm.\nIn the same scene, Exterme stabbed at Birdie and hardened a whisper. “Tell me. Tell me, please. I need to know, or else, he’ll kill my only friends.”\nBirdie fell to the ground, falling away. He died.\nShifting to the larger city, elsewhere, the gate with its water-stained cracks closed, and Cali put each of her children to sleep.\nIn another place, Don forgot to remove a small fire, trudging toward it, and falling backwards as the night birds fluttered about.\nBack at the scene of the murder, Twerp grabbed Birdie’s shoulders and hugged him from behind, pulling him toward a log and boulder.\nExterme chased after them, shouting at Twerp to stop running.\nAfter some time passed, Twerp told Exterme to look behind him.\nWhen Exterme turned around, Algae, Kloe, and Jared grabbed him and put him to sleep.\nNow that the chase was over, Twerp let himself collapse, falling to the ground as he tripped backwards, holding again onto Birdie. His face was strained, and his expressions were wrinkly. His mouth was moving up and down, as the hushed voice among the adventurers crescendoed.\nSoon, the rest of the goblin warriors arrived, standing before one of their member’s decaying body. Their eyes were hard, and then they were soft. They adjusted him until he was curled up.\nAfter the group finally returned to the city and headed to an open forest area, Heset, who was the hare person, said, “How long does a goblin last—oh, sorry, manners.” He was a part of the group Exterme belonged to, but he didn’t think that Exterme would kill Bata like that. When Exterme chased Twerp, they still couldn’t gather up the confidence to kill him. That was why it was a good thing they passed by the camp where Jared, Algae, and Kloe stayed earlier. They had gotten their help to stop Exterme. “How much can a warrior goblin take?” It was a weird question, but he felt that this incident was avoidable if Birdie was stronger. Of course, he knew that it was rest of the party’s fault for just watching him chase after Twerp. But Birdie didn’t have to die.\nThey were adventurers, so killing goblins was normal. But these adventurers were part of a new agreement that involved not fighting monsters associated with hermits like Don. Solvent was instrumental in this process, so even if he considered herself a lost soul after her loss, she still had a strong influence among the adventurers. In reality, she just needed a break.\nReturning to the moment, incidentally, Ritand touched his pocket, where the mechanical toy Birdie had was.\nBata tried to answer Heset, “Good—”\n“Enough for a beating,\" interrupted Twerp, echoing what he felt was Heset’s mocking tone, directing this tone at Heset.\nHeset sat down politely. “Is that how they describe you? ‘Underlings of Sam.’” In order to lighten the mood, he placed his legs on the table in front of him. He had the brightest intentions, but he always found a way to make things offensive.\nAnd the thing was that Ritand and Bata were the ones being patient with him.\nHeset was pushing a conversation with them, and Ritand and Bata were letting him do so.\nTwerp curled his lip, making sure his arms leaned on the table against Heset’s legs.\nHeset put down his legs and turned his head away.\n“Don and I are done,” Bata said vaguely, leaning his arms beside Twerp’s hands on the table. “Anything?” He tilted his head toward Twerp and Ritand.\nTwerp muttered and left the table at the same time as Heset did, putting on his gambeson.\nSome time after this interaction, at an inn at Promise City, Jared smoothened his skirt and sat on a chair, hardening his voice. “Are you sure you want to do a side quest with us?” he said, putting a leg to the side of the chair and his other tiptoing on the ground. For context, Cali had mentioned that she wanted to join their small-time adventurer group. It was Don’s first request to her.\n“I need a little more though.” Cali raised a hand and made a pinch with two fingers.\nThey drank mugs of coffee, as Cali noticed Solvent. Solvent was walking backwards and conducting for a traveling choir.\nShe grabbed her arm and rubbed it back and forth. The presence of Don in the city bothered her, but it made her more safe at the same time.\nShe got up and finished her task, learning that the choirs had strange birthmarks on their necks.\nWhen Algae left through the door before Jared, he made a hesitation sound first and then said, “That’s Solvent, some church official who has an outreach here. I know her from my time back at NCA.”\n“Should I know what that means?” Cali said.\n“Weak country, small country, power play stuff,” said Kloe, chewing with his mouth closed. “Why don’t you tell me about your time there?.”\nAlgae slapped his neck, failing to hit a fly sitting on him. “I worked as staff for a month—”\nKloe guffawed and patted Algae on the arm, as Algae drew away, going in front of Jared, who was studying Heset standing on two legs.\n“Do they have like an extra muscle in this?” Jared said, teasing Heset.\nHeset heard and swore at him.\nJared backed off, laughing so hard he slapped the back of Kloe, who was laughing as well.\nKloe almost tripped from the impact. “Hey!”\nJared glanced between Heset and Kloe. “Apologies… Oh, yeah, the troll said he’d meet up… here.”\nEventually, outside the inn, Don arrived, towering over Jared, his expression stiff. He squatted down and said, “Why is it so hot in here?”\nJared raised a brow. “It’s hot in here because it’s the Palamatas.\" Seeing an opportunity to mention his goal for coming here to meet Don, he asked, “Can we say something?”\nDon gave him a stare of agreement.\nJared sighed and moved the things he was holding under his arm. “I’ll pay you for asking this once it’s over, but how much does a goblin warrior—”\nKloe placed a hand on Jared. He muttered. “After the stunt Algae pulled?” He cursed. To clarify, it was Algae’s idea to cage Bata, Birdie, and Twerp earlier, and Jared had been the one most in on it.\nPatting his own forehead in contemplation, Jared looked at Algae and nodded, gesturing for him to talk.\nAlgae went forward and said, “What do you think we should do? You told us to leave you for a few days, and now, what do you want?” He was being direct.\nTheir previous interactions had been entirely vague due to how uncommunicative Don was as a troll. So this time, Algae was finally breaking the ice and directing everything to this singular point: “What do you want?”\nDon took a deep breath and handed him a small toy.\nAlgae backed off two meters of distance instinctively. As a result of this, Kloe and Jared glared at him, worried that Algae’s reaction might have offended Don. So Algae ran back to Don. “I think this means we’re fine?” he said.\nDon was very bad at communication, but this world was weird. So the adventurers, with their already unique culture, were the closest ones to a sense that things were coherent and clear in terms of communication and direction.\nAnyway, Don handed Algae a long list of names, some of which being Birdie’s extended family. At the top of the list, it read “Goblindom.”\nLong afterwards, elsewhere, Jared, Kloe, and Algae and the rest of the members of their party “Saero” dropped off a cart. They surveyed the landscape where Sam’s goblin workers were clearing trees. These were the same workers whom Don had supposedly killed. But they were still alive.\n“Sam is dead,” he read from a manuscript Ritand gave him. “Stop.” It was a reminder and a warning to the workers of their current position of weakness and new submission to Don.\nThe goblin workers looked overworked and dishevealed. Six of the goblin workers had been recuperating for injuries across their arms since Sam’s death. Earlier, these six took a stance against Don, and that was enough for Don to invite them after the goblin warriors.\n“Don’t bother repeating,” one of them told Ritand.\nEventually, the goblin workers put down their tools and slumped down onto boulders. Some of them put their hands all over their heads and faces, groaning.\n“I should have known Ritand had this in mind,” said Twerp, pacing back and forth behind the goblin workers. He was concerned about the workers, having been harmoniously under Sam with them for a long time.\n“Ritand wants you replaced,” said Algae, rubbing his chin.\nSurprised, Twerp tripped and dirtied himself.\n“Is that enough?” Algae looked at Jared and Kloe, who were nodding at him. They wanted to test Twerp’s resolve.\nMeanwhile, Ritand stood in the distance.\nReturning to Algae, he sighed and he continued, “I need someone I can trust here. I’ll let you guys sort things out—” He was referring to the fact that the entire goblin worker group was being used up, so now, having been brought here by Don in order to keep watch, it was hard for him to feel comfortable, because they were adventurers, not Don’s donkeys.\n“Wait a minute,” said Jared and stood up, speeding up to Algae.\nTwerp rubbed the last dirt particles off his clothes at his back. “Don’t worry. I had that with Birdie, I think.” He cupped his chin, failing to pull a boulder under him. He tried grabbing it with two hands and gave up. He sighed, sitting down where two of the goblin workers blocked his line of sight. “I might have done a little challenge under Kyra and Cali, remember?” He looked to his right and covered his mouth. “Ah, right—” He chuckled.\nAround the same time, one of the goblin workers insulted one of the adventurers.\n“Ah, see, that’s it. Just have a tiny brawl with your buddies. No hard feelings, okay?” He chuckled harder. He softened his voice. “I’m serious.” He saluted toward Extreme, who was passing by.\nThe adventurers, whose voices were so soft earlier, now shouted at Exterme, worried that he would attack Bata and Ritand since he had killed Birdie. Moreover, they were sure they themselves had sent him to prison. But Exterme was passing by like nothing had happened.\nTwerp said: “I found it when you—is it, Jared? Is it fair that he gets to quit the party with only a few scratches—broken bones is fair? Sorry, man. I need more than that—” He was referring to an agreement between him and Jared. For context, Jared had already decided to quit his adventurer party. Moreover, Twerp was angry with Jared since Jared was the one tasked to kill Exterme.\nBefore anything could happen, Exterme left.\nLater, Don got down from a carriage with Bata; the carriage belonged to Cali’s father. Behind them, a mother and a child exited and sat down on their haunches at the side. Despite what happened between them in the past, Don had decided to let them come. As for the reasons of Don and the mother, Don just allowed things to happen when it presented itself, while the mother was curious about Don. For context, she didn’t know that Ritand had created a magical explosion in the city and that Don had killed Sam. She was just curious after seeing Don earlier and asked to join her.\nAnyway, Don minded the rocks on the ground before her and chewed an unpeeled saba banana without pulling it off from the mottled banana hand.\nIn the meantime, Twerp saluted as a teasing gesture, stopping when Ritand shot him a curious but piercing stare.\nShifting to Ritand, he was eating banana cue, handing half of it to Bata. Bata shook his head, grabbed it, and offered it to Twerp.\nRitand was still staring, as Twerp sat on his haunches with submission.\nIn the distance, the goblin workers stayed slumping on their boulders, and the adventurers bunched together on a slope like a choir.\nMoving on to Bata, he dragged Twerp to him and said, “The mining business is why we are here.” He nodded at Ritand.\nRitand said, “Go with us.” He was holding a pickaxe and slamming at a few cobblestones.\n“Just go? Now…?” Twerp wanted to say, but Ritand handed him a handful of gravel.\nTwerp gave him a side glance and took the gravel, shaking as he balanced himself as he walked away. “What should I do…?”\nRitand said, “Give it to—” He pointed to Exterme, who was lying on the ground because of his broken body. Don pummelled him after seeing him on the way here earlier.\n“I should really tell you how to deal with Birdie’s death.” Twerp chuckled, imitating Birdie’s laugh, tone, and words. “I know you’re struggling…” It was a weird statement, because he was the one that was struggling and confused. Ritand didn’t care at all.\nRitand gave him an empty stare, looking at Don.\nDon walked up to the goblin workers, listening to them talk about the hare people. She listened to the goblin warriors talk about this earlier, so she was curious.\nHowever, a piercing scream broke Don’s focus.\nIt was Ritand who screamed. He lost his breath and fell to the ground, as an invisible enemy removed their invisibility to apply the final attack.\nThe structure of this little community included the goblin warriors, the goblin workers, the adventurers, Solvent, Ritand, Bata, Don, Cali, Kyra, and Twerp, among others. No matter how horrific Ritand scream was, the monsters did not feel anything.\nPrologue (5) - Chaos in the City and the Forest Encounter linkCallously, Don pushed Ritand down the slope, sliding toward the attacker gallopping away.\nThe adventurers stayed back and watched Don dashing and grabbing at anything to help boost her.\nThey wanted to know if Don was the powerful hermit they used to see her as.\nCalli, who was standing far off from Don, near the attacker, watched the small attacker split to three forms. Each of these forms had twisted, spiraling appendages.\nDon stopped.\nZooming into a magical illusion cast by the enemy, a parade of the crowds from Sam’s time rang in Don’s ear, turning the ground into another playground for his whispers. Cali’s long complaints about Sam echoed through Don’s body with Birdie’s narration. Sam’s strange stare blew against Don until she was skinless. This imagination was a wet stain on her muscles, growing every time she imagined herself rubbing her skin.\nReturning to reality, the forms left the scene, and Ritand sat up, pushing the blood off himself. He dried his hands with a cloth, imitating Don one time.\nDon sat down and glanced at the adventurers, goblin workers, two goblins, mother and child, and Solvent in the distance.\nShe interlaced her fingers and grinded them back and forth, and, after a long mouth smile, put her fingertips together into a steeple.\nShe stood up and walked up to the cart, passing it and stopping in the middle of the road.\nShe tilted her head, raising her gaze from the ground toward the distance ahead of her.\nEven after being unable to catch the enemy, Don only looked a little bothered.\nLater, Solvent arrived, walked up to her, and said, “Are we leaving again, the Don?” She was sweating and pretended to be tired by panting because she didn’t want Don to feel threatened.\nHeading into a new stage, some time after this event, some of Solvent’s new members in the church asked one of the city officials if they could help sweep the streets with the older women.\nTransitioning to the road leading inside the city, there, Solvent sighed, looking between Don and Orlanta City, which lay at the horizon.\nEmbarking on a metaphorical journey, the looping spiral of architectural comprehension welcomed the used coffee grounds. The coffee grounds provided the coffee plants their precious fertilizer. Solvent opened the gates and closed them, and she put the coffee grounds in sacks and removed them. The looping spirals were the gates, and the coffee grounds were the people: the gates and the people were the city. She said, “The city is right there.”\nFalling back to the moment, Solvent looked at Don, curious.\nDon stared long, ignoring Solvent and the city, imagining the horizon.\nProgressing into the inner city, humans patrolled around with a troll there. “Helping is not obligatory,” said the troll, blocking traffic and directing the traffic to another road that he opened up. “I need every one of you directly combined with the small task force in Small Blithe.”\nWhen Ritand cast the magical explosion, most of the inner city burned down, representing the loss of the city’s first layer of skin.\nAlongside this loss, opportunistic monsters from outside gathered around and replaced the gangs that fell apart. Adding to the chaos, bandits waited outside the city, offering a way for these monsters to get inside smoothly, and once the monsters took the bait, they robbed them.\nIn response to the chaos, the city authorities created many new provisional forces. As a result, the bandits stopped after only one day. Coincidentally, mage apprentices and squires practiced their hands during this time, being part of the forces.\nReturning to Don, as she walked toward the city.\nMeanwhile, Solvent remembered her dream two years ago.\nIn this dream, she and Don fought each other. Don gave her a light slap and asked her what she needed to be strong. In response, Solvent threw out a flock of orbs from her rolling fingers and let them bloom in the whirls of the air and fade. She tore gasses from her mouth with her nails, letting the pressure explode. She tired and dropped to the ground, making a light hiccup. Don put each orb down and slammed her fists against the pavement, bringing the stones to slam against the orbs. She sucked the gasses that flew across his face, coughing them out until she laughed, roaring all the air out. Solvent died soon after.\nReturning to reality, some time after Solvent and Don entered the city, many things occurred in different locations and times.\nFirst, Solvent’s eyes moved from Don to small goblins. These goblins greeted humans and asked them about their opinions on clothing.\nSecond, Don could only have gotten stronger since then. She strided across the road and reached the city, towering above the guardstones of the gate. Her presence demanded a coalition against her, but she was too far from them to feel the pinches of one.\nThird, Calli recruited, screened, and interviewed applicants from a human influx that Solvent provided.\nProgressing to the fourth longer scene, Jared dropped by a shop and asked as he waved goodbye at the Don and the others. “Oh, dang, the prices have gone up. Is the price the same there?”\nCalli glanced between him, Kyra, Algae, and Kloe. Algae exchanged four silver coins for lettuce and said, poking a curious child on the hands, “It’s somewhat thrice as expensive—” A mother shouted at him, telling him to stop touching her child. He apologized and bowed his head, grabbing his 10 bronze coins change. “It might be temporary because of the fire.”\n“Fire,” Calli said, frowning, looking at Don. She thought Don might tell her about the fire since she told her that she killed Sam.\nKyra looked at Algae, asking him if he preferred people with children.\nAlgae thought she asked him if he felt a kinship with people with children. He nodded, having a goodbye with the child, hiding himself when he saw the mother glance at him. He had been entertaining the child before the mother finished her business with the vendors.\nJared poked inside one of the stores, finding an empty rocker. “I notice that some of these stories have weird scratchings. Do you guys see this in the others, too?”\nAlgae frowned and arrived first before Calli, who was busy asking Don about the fire.\nVenturing into the fifth scene, Kloe was making his rounds when he saw a bunch of hare people gathering to demolish a house.\nSixth, a group of human contractors put down the last goblins in front of them. They tore through the books that the goblin warriors stole from their client by accident. Three goblins, friends of Birdie and Twerp, died.\nSeventh, Solvent used the spell Heaven’s Joy and fractured the shields and armor until they fell upon the stalagmites that awaited them. She laughed, remembering the story Birdie told her about Calli. She burned the contractors, whose gambesons read “NCA,” and “Hellioawwerax.”\nEighth, Exterme was sitting down, waiting for his wounds to heal, remembering the quest that the hermit Don told them. He said the words: “‘Go to the city to the west, and I’ll reward you with a pretty heavy wand.’” Also, he remembered Algae, Kloe, and Jared’s words and actions.\n“I should know that all hermits ask you to get something faraway as a last request,” he quoted Algae, imitating his movements when he said this, shaking his leg as if he had cramps.\n“Assuredly, you know the foes of the hermits—the warlocks, remember?” he quoted Kloe. In imitation of him, he rolled his shoulders around and pressed against his waist, failing to crack his body when he twisted around.\n“‘I wouldn’t know—’” he quoted Jared, imitating him by chewing on air, drinking from air, and faking a lame burp.\nAfter doing this, he greeted a young man with uneven eyes.\nDiving into the ninth scene, three hours ago, in the city Hereas, a young man lifted both whips of his hair back to its place, tearing open a large chest, leg pressed against it. He sighed and removed all the weight of his voice. “Howdy, little chesty. Make sure you’re tight and hungry.” He gave the mimic a light slap on the side. “Oy, I know you’re in there, Funny!” He already had a name for this random mimic.\nThe mimic felt the boot with cone-endings, metal straps around the middle, and a long blade jutting out from beneath.\nThe man kicked the mimic to the wall, jumped, and caught it. “Oh, silly Funny!” He ripped apart with his hands the mouth that had failed to open and dumped poisonous leaves inside. He laughed, watching as the mimic went ballistic and rolled around hoping for its tongue to get every inch of poison out.\nHe stopped laughing when the mimic threw its tongue and wrapped it around his leg. He cut it in an instant, putting back in its place his short sword. “I suggest you put that down, Mister.” He chewed his lip and squatted in front of it, leaning his head. He grasped it on the side and stared inside, caressing it up and down. “You need to stop and give me the core.” He whispered hushes and tight nudges along where its shoulders and back would be.\nHis voice turned to shallow breaths.\nThe mimic jumped and ran away out of the room and around a corner.\nHe laughed with giggles toward the end, his smile softening his masculine grippy features. He waved his hand from side to side, saying “Bye,” a poof escaping his mouth.\nA few minutes later, the mimic yelped after he turned another corner.\nThe human was in the distance in front of him, leaning the side of a knee against the wall, resting both hands on it, and stretching his other leg forward. His head pointed toward his other leg, and he eyed him, smirking, as a dimple formed on his face’s one side.\nThe mimic gasped and hyperventilated, running down a flight of stairs.\nThe human left the dungeon and appeared in front of a monster group, the weight returning to his voice. “It’s there, but I can’t beat it. Can you help me—”\nA troll slapped him. “What is it with you?” she said, her voice mirroring that of a neglected child. “Respect those who’ve come to help you in the first place. Say ‘may!’ ‘May!’”\n“I see.” The human, Hellioawwerax touched his face, tilting his head downwards at her necklace.\nIt shone bright every time its owner was emotional, and it wasn’t shining now.\n“Good one!” He laughed, placing a hand on her shoulder.\nShe kicked him on the balls and got one of the other monsters beside her to punch him in the face.\nHe fell to the ground, his body aching on the belly, sides, balls, and knees. “Ah, did it break?”\nShe raised an hatchet and hurled it down in an arc, stopping before it hit his face. “You see this. Beg.”\n“Ah, sorry, let me just—”\n“Beg!”\n“Not sorry anymore—” He disappeared and appeared behind them with a mimic under his arm, looking at it. “Howdy, Funny. Howdy, Missus.” He grinned, his face red, but the mimic’s eyes redder.\nThe mimic lashed its tongue and broke their armor, as Hellioawwerax swooped in to unarm them from their weapons and shields. He jumped over them in a front flip, placed sticky glue where their limbs folded, landed with outstretched arms in a bow, and dashed away. “Hehe.”\nThe mimic jumped toward him, and he caught it in the air as he jumped, falling over the cliff. “See ya, major suckers for life!”\n“I love you, little Funny. Remind me of this when I get old, okay?” He gave it a warm smile, making the mimic his little pet.\n“I should really give you a hug.” His voice was distant as if he remembered something.\nA dragon arrived to catch him, asking him about the rest of the monsters.\n“‘They died because of their weakness’—” He laughed, interrupting himself. He patted the dragon and pointed a sword to the horizon, where they landed in a forest below them. He sang a song about the city mayor Sam, as the dragon finished flapping his winds.\nA tall forest of trees that covered the sky welcomed him with melodies of the flapping of birds and the calls of animals of big and small. He shook with excitement, holding onto the dragon’s bone’s wing, bouncing with rotation.\nThe mimic struggled to get down, being careful as it edged its way.\nHe caught it, hugged it, and put it down, listening to the growing whispers of the forest. He gulped and looked at his dragon and then at the mimic’s back in front of him. He took a deep breath and sped up his walk.\nHe saw a small bouncy woman dancing in a clearing in front of him.\nHe frowned because he was thinking, but then, he smiled because he had an idea.\nHe cast a spell of protection for himself and had the dragon sit and watch. He brought the mimic with him and joined the woman, standing in front of her and starting with a kick to the left.\nHe danced, watching the slow fall of her arms as she spun and spun as her eyes locked with his.\nHe was amazed by how well she kept her gaze and applauded her, nodding, clapping, and saying goodbye to the mimic by tapping it.\nHe asked her, “Is the sun bright today? Or are you one of the forest elves?”\n“Yes.”\n“Uh, I see, bright today, huh? He looked up where the clouds and the trees covered the sun. “W-what? You’re an elf?”\nThe elven woman smiled and nodded. “Yes,” she repeated.\n“I see. How about this?” He handed her a large orb and deepened his already low voice. “Do you like orbs?”\nThe woman screamed.\nShe galloped toward the orb and swallowed it whole, choking on it.\nHe stared at her, glancing between her and the mimic walking up to his side.\nShe stopped choking and got the orb down in her stomach.\nHe puked and watched the ground turn purple and red.\nThe woman’s legs got taller, as her head reached higher and higher up up to the forest canopy. She manically laughed as her voice dried up, cracking and disappearing into nothingness.\nHe gave a nervous laugh and walked away, hiding underneath the dragon’s wing.\nThe woman swung her fist at him.\nHe caught it, but his hand slipped in a second, half-tripping.\nThe adventurer Exterme stabbed the woman, pulling her left and right and failing to kill her. He struggled to pull it out and stabbed her again on the cheek. He winced, running away when the woman clawed at him.\nMeanwhile, Bata and Ritand followed behind him, slumping down on the ground.\nThey had avoided talking and reacting to Exterme when they reminded him about the quest a long while ago.\nExterme grew frustrated, punching the woman on the cheek until she avoided his middle-finger punches.\nHellioawwerax took a deep breath and sat down a distance away from the woman, Exterme, Bata, and Ritand. He continued the song from a while ago.\nJumping to the broader level concluding these nine scenes, this was a very surreal, ambiguous, and disjointed series of events.\nChapter 1 - Troll Tycoon linkDon watched the sun falling down. The past events had been chaotic, but now she was relaxing.\nWalking throughout the city, her movements were careful and discreet, but she knew that even with her attempts to be elegant, the lumbering form she possessed demanded her clumsiness and hard-hitting attacks.\nSoon, she met one of her friends, a goblin named “Bata.” He was sitting down silently and not even giving her attention. He was bored because his younger brother was not here.\n“How are you?” Don said, her voice quiet and brooding. It was a troll’s voice, that of a terrifying nature. She kept her emotions under the surface, unable to communicate herself effectively with facial expressions and body language.\nBata raised his head, and then his eyes began darting around with hesitation before he lowered his head again, ignoring Don.\nConfusedly, she said, “What do you want?”\nBata looked around. “Where’s Ritand? He hasn’t come back in a while.”\nDon had began taking care of Bata and Ritand a long time ago, and even after becoming a more established part of the city, she still cared about them. She wanted them to be okay, and she didn’t care about the many other people who had become a part of her life recently all that much. But if Ritand and Bata died, she would move on, because she was a monster. And monsters didn’t feel anything.\n“He’s with my workers, as per usual.” She was surprised he didn’t know that.\nAfter conversing for a while, Bata joined Don in heading to her new settlement.\nMoving on to Don’s current goals in mind, they included arranging the people under her authority, having equipped herself with various sources of power. Indeed, her next goal now was to expand through the dungeons.\nBeing a monster, it wouldn’t be that hard to engage in warfare.\nShe wore a hermit’s red and blue clothes and went out to the fields within the forest. Here, Don saw beauty in the moment. To name one example, the sun danced like lillies leaping with joy at the sight of the glorious light. Second, the sky moved along a narrow path, creating clouds that beamed magically to the horizon, casting magical shadowy effects upon the region.\nShifting focus to her people, they were goblins, and they were her workers, collecting resources slowly, providing her a gradual approach to understanding how to control her environment. But she didn’t just have workers.\nRelevantly, she marshalled her goblin soldiers, making sure they were paying attention in case a human adventurer party attacked them.\nZooming to a broader level, as a troll powerful enough to shake forests, her goal here was to complete her quest of understanding this world.\nCurrently, she was a level 15 warlock, one that had a lack of soldiers and still struggled to make ends meet. Indeed, despite her status as a powerful troll, her past decisions of betraying her former contractors had left her only with herself and a group of trusted companions to rely on.\nHer goals for now were to recruit more goblin workers and soldiers and slowly level them up.\nShe went to a small lumberer’s hut and told the goblin workers to sit down and relax here while she surveyed the area. In fact, she got the workers to survey as well eventually.\nShe selected two goblin workers in one direction and three goblins in another, having the rest in a third direction toward a giant mountain cave. She kept them in groups in case something or someone attacked them.\nSo when it came to her overall strategy or plan, it consisted of three aspects needing explanation. First, she had 26 goblin workers right now and 15 goblin soldiers, so in order to maintain tehse goblins, she had to have food resources and housing for them. The good thing was that goblins could sleep anywhere on cave floor. Second, she was a level 15 warlock, but her goblins all had different simple skills and levels. Therefore, she needed to check them periodically in order to have them distribute their unused stat points gained from leveling effectively. Naturally, this checking would also involve everything else about the stat [System]. When it came to the third aspect, she also had certain buildings and locations within her control, and sustaining them took effort on her own part. This was why she couldn’t just progress without examining her encompassing operation and upholding its accompanying demands.\nShe checked the status page of one of the goblins by using [Identify].\nLevel 1\nRange - 300 (1 meter)\nWeapon - Sword (Wooden)\nMoney - 5$\nHealth - 50/50\nMana - 20/20\nSpells - Fire Blast, Ice shot\nArmor - N/A\nStrength (STR) - 10\nDexterity (DEX) - 10\nConstitution (CON) - 10\nIntelligence (INT) - 10\nWisdom (WIS) - 10\nCharisma (CHA) - 10\nLuck (LUK) - 10\nDescription - Gobby the Goblin. They found a spellbook one day and learned fire and ice spells. Now, armed with a wooden sword, Gobby protects the forest from Shadow Sprites, spreading joy on their adventures.\nThis was her goal. This was her purpose.\nShe might have had a long history that she couldn’t explain in a day.\nBut that did not matter. What mattered was that she could continue to create new generations that had it better.\nThe goblins were the troops, and they would be leveling up by themselves and growing like they were tycoons. Don would be the tycoon owner of tycoons in this metaphor then.\nAnyway, after her goblins completed their search, Don moved to engage in slash-and-burn agriculture due to the density of the forest. With the help of her giant, powerful body, she looked to the mountainsides and wondered if she could create terraces due to the heavy rainfall found naturally in this tropcial region. She had learned about this from smart friends like Sam, someone who had sadly passed away some time ago.\nNow that her goblin workers were slashing and burning, she selected her goblin warriors and had them continue patrolling around to gain vision and control of the area. This place had already been vision-checked before, but now that they were here. The goal was to clean up and establish more permanent control, which took a long time to start laying the foundations for facilities and various elements of infrastructure. This would pave the way for creating a small, budding tycoon community that would slowly accrue her money and influence while also leveling the community members.\nCurrently, she was thinking of obtaining a totem that was known to scare pests and critters away. But that would take a long time because it was deep in a dungeon.\nHowever, she was strong, so she decided to delegate her role as leader of the community to one of her goblins and began visiting the cave.\nThe morning was quiet, enough to signal a new start, and diseases and damages from the day before were cured.\nDespite already being healthy and missing the timing for this morning benefit, Don continued down the first floor of the cave, scaring off most wild goblins. But when it came to larger creatures like slimes and giant bats, she fought them for a while and gained XP toward her next level.\nLevel 15 | 2/37 XP\nKilling a slime or a giant bat only gave 1 XP for her since she was already very strong as a troll and very high in level. The [System] penalized her for farming XP without looking for novel and more challenging fights, resulting in her only getting 1 XP.\nBut she was in the cave for a totem.\nAfter locating the totem, she ran all the way back to the base because it had to be placed immediately, or else it would disintegrate.\nAfter placing it down, the new community was immediately recognized by the [System].\nYou have established a new community. For your efforts, you will now be shown a new panel to control and monitor your community status better.\nAttribute Status Settlement Name [Insert Name] Population Overview Goblin Workers 26 Goblin Warriors 15 Goblins 2 Troll (Leader) 1 Resource Status Food Limited provisions Water Limited supply Shelter Simple settlement housing Defensive Measures Walls None Guard Posts None Infrastructure Housing Basic shelters for inhabitants Markets None Farms None Community Welfare Health Facilities None Education None Economic Activities Trade None Crafting None Current Events Recent Attacks None Diplomatic Relations None Upcoming Events None scheduled She called the settlement “Dontown.”\nAfterwards, she returned to her settlement and discovered many risks that needed addressing.\nNo. Tropical Rainforest Challenge 1. Harsh Environment 2. Disease Outbreaks 3. Limited Clean Water 4. Resource Scarcity 5. Infrastructure Challenges 6. Wildlife Encounters 7. Isolation and Connectivity 8. Cultural Integration 9. Sustainability Practices 10. Natural Hazards Her goal was to mitigate these risks and hopefully solve them before her community bit the dust.\nAs she began helping the goblins work, a man wearing a purple and yellow outfit scurried to the village before placing a bomb.\nIt exploded, shocking the rest of the camp.\nDon began moving her reinforcements forward.\nThe bomb was followed by the emergence of a giant army. They wanted to rid this world of the Don, a threat that had showed signs of budding growth in the east of the human empire. So this was their hello, a way of greeting a potential threat from amassing enough strength.\nDon did not feel anything.\nSkills castrated her power, and they began attacking her, chipping at her health bar slowly, as she struggled.\nA party of human adventurers entered the scene, being friends of Don. She had expressed indifference toward them, but she needed their help now.\nAmong them, Jared, Kloe, and Algae began shouting in chorus.\nMoreover, a large number of goblins belonging to the extended family of Birdie, one of Don’s former members, joined as well. They were here for Twerp, a friend of Birdie.\nFurthermore, Exterme and his party were there as well, even if Don had a complicated history with him after he killed Birdie.\nTwo fishmen public servants, Kyra and Cali were also there. Kyra grabbed a weighty, disproportionate magical instrument from her pouch and activated it, buffing her fellow fighters with increased speed.\nThey swiftly frustrated the enemy attack and fended them off, forcing them to make a strategic retreat.\nBut they would soon return.\nAfter the fight, Matthew and his friends who had come to save him had a feast to celebrate, as the night came to close. When it was morning, everyone’s sicknesses, diseases, and wounds healed, encouraging them to keep growing as a team.\nExterme said: “So what’s going on, boys? I know it’s been a long while, but let’s just say that this has been the best time ever. I finally was able to use my [Rasungun]. Powerful skill really. Should’ve given it to Mr. Martine, but hey, this is fine too.”\nThe personality switch weirded out the group, but they already knew Exterme was a horrible, disgusting weird person. The fact that he had helped them made that feel this side of him was more like a front than anything, but it was still hard to look at. But at least he was trying maybe.\nIn the end, the group, despite having gotten over a large barrier, still had to navigate the challenges and confusions inherent in their different personalities, goals, and styles of communication, among other things.\nBut it was nice to get together every once in a while.\nUltimately, Don’s new settlement, since it blocked human adventurers’ path to the sea, was going to be targeted no matter what. That was why the friends that had come would stay, because they could get a lot out of this. The adjacent city would eventually begin showing support for Don’s decision.\nMoving forward, Don would have to hurry up, because the many issues and unknowns in the background were creeping closer like minor enemies becoming stronger overtime when left unchecked. That was also the reason she was attacked today, because they wanted to check and test her, hoping to eliminate her at her weakest.\nChapter 2 - Trials and Triumphs in Dontown linkDon observed several dogs staring at her, her hands wrapped around a large chest. She had to hurry up and get a totem again because the last one ran out immediately.\nIn the meantime, she looked at the new settlement’s statue page.\nAttribute Status Settlement Name Dontown Population Overview Goblin Workers 26 Goblin Warriors 15 Goblins 2 Troll (Leader) 1 Resource Status Food Limited provisions Water Limited supply Shelter Simple settlement housing Defensive Measures Walls None Guard Posts None Infrastructure Housing Basic shelters for inhabitants Markets None Farms None Community Welfare Health Facilities None Education None Economic Activities Trade None Crafting None Current Events Recent Attacks None Diplomatic Relations None Upcoming Events None scheduled Don visiting various places, using her connections to help bring some much needed provisions for the settlement’s early phases. She got plenty of crops that she immediately had planted.\nIt was easy like eating freshly cooked meat on a summer day.\nHer issues now were a lot, but for now, she would be talking with the individuals in her settlement to clear out any confusion.\nShe met one of the goblins, Zupupu, directing him toward a log.\n“Do you know anyone here?” she said.\n“Hmm… No—of course I know everyone!”\nDon shrugged. “Okay, then, how about this? Do you know who you are?”\nZupupu’s eyes lowered. “I know myself more than anyone else, but what I want to know is why the heck are you asking me these questions!”\nDon gave a thumbs-up. “Okay, next question, I want to know if you’ve been eating anything.”\nZupupu ran away.\nDon wiped the sweat off his forehead. “Looks like this’ll be a hard one.”\nAfter interviewing each goblin, she then headed to the city and talked to an adventurer party called “Saero,” which included familiar friends such as Jared, Kloe, and Algae.\nJared stared at him. “Don, what’s up?”\n“I was wondering if you guys need any help. I’m not really forcing you, but I want to help. I want to help because my settlement needs more people, so if I was thinking that if I help, then more people would come.”\n“Incomprehensible logic there Don, but that’s better than nothing. Come on let’s go!” Jared said, heading out and showing Don a dungeon.\n“Okay, so if you hit this dungeon really hard,” he explained, “It will explode.”\nDon knew that, but she couldn’t communicate well enough. That was her struggle.\nLater, Jared showed Don various different items in a shop. “Okay, before we head out, I was hoping to show you this. Get one of those clubs, alright? You like that?”\nDon nodded, recognizing the power in sheer mass. “This doesn’t fit my size.”\n“Yeah, but I can get someone that’ll make one of those.”\nThe shop keeper looked at him with a squint that said, “You come here just to look at my items and leave?”\nAnyway, the adventurer party and Don left to a tower where they met a bubbly little princess-like woman who showed them birds and various monsters in cages. “W-why are you…” she said, daunted by the size of Don. She was a female bird-man herself with a bird head, but even she found Don intimidating because of her gigantic stature. “…here?”\nDon glanced at Jared, who said, “We need a club. I know you have one of those. You use it to help the feedery.”\n“Stop calling it a ‘feedery’,” the woman said. “It’s a feeding area, idiot!”\n“I like calling it that, Marshall.” He turned to Don. “Her name is Marshall, okay?”\nDon nodded.\nThe woman, Marshall said: “I see now that you’re trying to reveal all my details! I see now. You’re trying to extort me and blackmail me, that’s it! Mom!”\nA dragon appeared outside through a portal, transforming into a bird-man and then slowly climbing the tower.\nAfter Don, the adventurer party, and Marshall awkwardly waited, the bird-man climbed the tower and entered the room. “How are you guys doing? Want bibingka?” said the mother of Marshall, carrying bibinka that she bought from a group of goblins. “I was wondering if maybe we should visit the Leroy sometime. It would be nice to see it again, what d’you think?”\nMarshall, the daughter, nodded aggressively. “Of course, I want to see it Mom, but Mom, they’re trying to reveal my information to the public.”\nMom snorted playfully. “It’s fine, dear. They’re just playing around, and they probably want something, don’t you boys?”\nJared nodded, saying yes slowly.\nMom laughed. “I guess we can just leave then. I’ll give you the club, and we’ll be off. Toodle-oo!”\nWhen they climbed down the tower and went outside, she opened a portal and took out a giant club from her dimensional storage, handing it to Don.\n“Don, it’s nice to meet you. What do you think about Marshall? Hope she’s not bothering you too much!” She and Marshall, who was trying to shush her about revealing details about her, left.\nDon and the adventurer party left, heading to a dungeon. “Okay, this is where we kill things,” said Jared, starting to bother Don.\nDon might have been a troll, but she didn’t like getting treated like she was unintelligent. Being bad at speaking and having a unique perception of life didn’t necessarily mean that she was dumb.\nAt the dungeon, it was quiet, water dripping.\nDon saw lush vegetation overcoming what was supposed to be a rocky cave floor. It smelled and felt like a bouquet with its freshness.\nThe wind moved flavorfully through the cave tunnel.\nShe went down the steps, accompanied by the small figures below her. These figures were the adventurers, who still had to be very careful around the giant Don, who was still a giant troll, no joke.\nWell, after they all finished up walking the steps, it was bound for them to encounter one of the wraiths who spawned in the cave. It was a big place after all.\nDon struck one of them, only to find her physical body passing through the wraiths, leaving it to the adventurers to try to fight it.\nHowever, none of the adventurers had magic, so they decided to book it.\nDon and the adventurers left the cave and looked for another place to enter that didn’t have wraiths or ghostly figures. It scared them so much one of the adventurers peed himself.\nIt worried Don to see such fear from what were supposed to be adventurous fellows. She guessed that people like them struggled to relax in dungeon environments if they didn’t have “a perfect plan” already in place.\nThe ghosts absolutely demolished their preparations.\nDon arrived at one of the junctures between several points in the dungeon. Her voice was deep and menacing. “Hey guys,” she said. “Where are we going?”\nShe didn’t actually know what they were supposed to be doing there, and Jared wasn’t the type to betray her. So she wanted to ask only now just in case Jared thought she knew where she was going.\nJared said, “I don’t know exactly, but I know it’s around here—”\n“Treasure?” said Don, excited at the idea of finding treasure now that she was with Jared. This cave was big enough to fit her, but often times, she found tunnels that led to places she couldn’t fit. And often times, these tunnels led to treasure chests.\n“Yeah, we’re expecting a rare bow at least!” he emphasized that like it was festivities.\nDon said okay.\nIt was not difficult to follow Jared, Kloe, and Algae, because they were very open around her.\nJared said, “I shouldn’t be peeing here!”\nKloe said, “I will! I already did! Too late!”\nAlgae burst into laughter.\nThe fact that they did this made her wonder if this world cared about them doing this so openly, or if they were they just weirdos.\nIt was hard not to hate people like these.\nInside the cave, the tunnels felt like they kept expanding, each leading to what felt like an eternity of doom and darkness.\nThey finally encountered an enemy, but it wasn’t ghosts this time.\nIt was a bunch of rock golems, and that would have wiped out the adventurers if it wasn’t for Don just blocking them with her body.\nThe golems were only 5 feet tall, so it wasn’t a fair fight.\nDon smashed them and didn’t give the adventurers time to hesitate and make changes midstream.\n“Finally,” she said, watching the surprised adventurers.\nThey never got used to seeing her beat up things effortlessly, huh.\nWell, she accepted that, realizing that this world rested upon her shoulders for her to take. People like her got what they got, and it was only natural for them to expand and develop the world.\nAs the fight ended, she noticed her XP increasing and her next level inching closer.\nLevel 15 | 2.00000000001/37 XP\nIt was only a 0.00000000001 XP increase, but she was feeling optimistic.\nShe noticed some of the adventurers starting to get confident. Well, happiness loved company.\nShe raised her arms in victory; hitting the cave ceiling and astounding the adventurers. “Whoops!” Her voice was even scarier.\nThe adventurers kept their distance, leaving Don to stare in silence. She felt embarassed, but it wasn’t automatic for her to scratch her head or do some gesture indicating so. She was just bad at communicating.\nBut the adventurers managed with it, walking back next to her.\nJared redirected them to their reason for being here: “Okay, so I know there’s a treasure around here. If not, we can just go back. It’s chill.”\nDon said yes, quietly this time.\nWhen they turned the corner, the wraiths in the distance was enough to dissuade them.\n“Okay, let’s leave everybody!” said Algae.\n“Alright!” said Kloe. Woohoo!”\n“Guys, be quiet!” said Jared before screaming as well, “Let’s go!”\nThey were screaming for screaming’s sake at this point—a bunch of hyper-excited man-children, but in a good way.\nDon adored that side of them, her voice chirping affectionately like a demon with how deep it sounded: “You guys…”\nAfter they left, Don parted ways with them and returned to the settlement, happy that her day was productive. “Ahh… 0.00000000001 XP…” she moaned in satisfaction.\nThe goblins glanced at her before returning to work, passing by a board that read all the problems of the village listed by the [System.]\nNo. Tropical Rainforest Challenge 1. Harsh Environment 2. Disease Outbreaks 3. Limited Clean Water 4. Resource Scarcity 5. Infrastructure Challenges 6. Wildlife Encounters 7. Isolation and Connectivity 8. Cultural Integration 9. Sustainability Practices 10. Natural Hazards Even now, it was hard to pretend that everything would go perfectly well.\n[One of your goblins had gotten sick! Go to them immediately!]\nDon ran and hired a healer from a nearby district to save the goblin.\nThe goblin didn’t die, but that meant something moving forward.\nDon decided to have healers at the city; however, she came to a problem.\nShe lacked the funds. Even if she had the goblins, who chose to follow her, that didn’t mean anyone else would do the same. The healers she wanted in Dontown didn’t care for her or the settlement.\nIn the end, she had to let go of this issue this one time.\nIf things went awry, it would become even worse than the situation now.\nShe had to pay attention, or else.\n"

                content: "⚠️ Novel Under Construction ⚠️ linkThis novel is a work in progress and may undergo changes. Sections may be incomplete or subject to revisions. Thank you for your patience and understanding!\nA man named John with dark hair and a stern expression stands at the center of the cover. He wears a regal purple robe, indicating nobility or magical prowess, and grips a sword with determination. Behind him looms a menacing landscape with twisted trees, shadowy figures, and a distant, ominous castle. The title “John” is prominently displayed in bold, yellow gothic font, suggesting a dark fantasy theme. Below it, the subtitle “the Traitor” is written in a smaller, similar style, hinting at the character’s complex role in the story.\nBook Description:\nJohn the Traitor tells the story of John Lee, a charismatic young man navigating the complexities of life in a world filled with magic, political intrigue, and goblin wars. Themes of family, love, loyalty, and the struggle for peace are explored as John faces challenges that test his morals and push him to his limits. The narrative unfolds through encounters with various characters, including his wife Amanda, a powerful sorceress; Sick, a mysterious and influential figure; and Sophia, a leader of a human resistance against the goblins. As alliances shift and hidden agendas are revealed, John must make difficult choices that will impact the fate of his family and the kingdom. The story includes thrilling battles, magical encounters, and moments of humor and heartbreak, keeping the reader engaged until the very end.\nChapter 1 - Homecoming and Omens linkA young man stepped outside a small inn, carrying a pouch with cups inside. He sat down on the side of the road as a carriage passed by. He raised his head, beret hat, and hand. The carriage stopped, and a couple of soldiers jumped out and pushed him because he was blocking the carriage door.\nHe chuckled when the carriage had left.\nThe young man left, entering a crowd of passersby.\nHe bumped into a group of women and children dressed in purple and yellow.\nHe left through the crowd and entered a small house where a tall, strict-faced woman paced around the room. Despite his rough travel home, the charisma and confidence in his demeanor persisted.\nHe smiled. “Amanda!” He placed down his pouch on a table.\nThe tall woman named “Amanda” showed him a small bed where her and the young man’s son lay and hugged a toy.\nThe young man named “John” picked up the toy and placed it on his son’s forehead.\nHe turned to Amanda. “How did they cancel the event so early? Is it just that way for them all the time?”\nAmanda shrugged. “‘Keep it slow,’ they said. If only Jared had published the books without getting caught, he would’ve been fine.”\nThe young man cursed. “I see now. It has to go this way or another. Anyways, since you went out there and saw the soldiers’ new armbands for yourself, how did the adventurers do?” John ravenously ate a delicious meal, afraid that he might forget to eat later.\nAmanda gave him a smile that reached the eyes. “In trouble.” She chuckled.\nJohn raised his brows. “‘Trouble trouble?’”\n“The good king of trouble. They’re collecting the Remnants right now.” Amanda gave him a suspicious but pleasant expression with a smirk.”\n“Heh, is it that unbelievable that they’re doing well? ‘Something trouble something’?”\n“They could be grazing the fields right now looking for the golden goose they said they found.” Amanda laughed.\nJohn frowned. “They’re not kids anymore, Amanda.”\n“I know.” Amanda gave him a knowing look.\n“No, I’m serious.” John looked half-serious.\n“John! I’m just joking!” Amanda sounded half-exasperated and half-joking.\nJohn kissed her and saluted as a goodbye.\nAmanda gave him a quick, succinct nod.\nJohn left, but he returned. “Did you get the cups?”\nAmanda nodded. “It was right here the whole time.” She shook the waist pouch that contained the cups.\nJohn turned to leave, but he noticed the scratch on her shoes. He fell on his knees and lowered his head. “I’ll fix it.”\nAmanda’s expression became tender toward John. She loved him.\nJohn gave her a quick smile. “I’ll pass by Mr. Sick.”\nAmanda handed him a tiny pouch of coins from a different country.\nJohn grinned. “I told him about you, and I also told him about the Dog Bandits. He was so surprised. He thought you were a ghost.”\nAmanda sat down and tapped the chair as John and her son left his room. Their son pressed against her elbow and hugged it.\nAmanda and John hugged the boy’s head.\nJohn left and entered a small town corner where a store-owner greeted him. “Hi, how’s the limelight, John?”\n“It’s sickening, Mr. Sick.” John’s voice was candid, and his demeanor was polite. He strode around.\nThe store-owner named “Sick” giggled sneakily like a little child. “‘Sickening’? Really?”\nJohn pretended to laugh nervously. “‘Wouldn’t you have loved it if you had a child?’” He imitated a friend.\n“‘Me, oh, John. I can’t believe it. He was beside me the whole time!’” Sick joined him.\nA group of a couple of women and three children emerged from the corner of Sick’s store. One of the women raised a hand that held a small orb.\nThe women greeted him as the children raced to the store and jumped up and down, crying for chocolate candies.\nThe child who held an orb handed it to John.\nJohn showed it to Sick, his expression becoming hostile. “See? Lavender purple like the rest of his works.” He removed the hostility of his voice. “What do you think about Charter’s ‘enterprise’?”\nSick laughed. “You can’t be jealous when your wife is the same woman he had coveted since he was young.”\nJohn furrowed his brows. “A little touchy, but…” He feigned a grin and a laugh. “But seriously though, how about his two sons? Can he seriously put them in a tournament at five years old?”\nSick turned left and right and pulled down the wooden cover for his store. He exited the store. He sprinted up to John, grabbed his shoulder with his left hand, and shook his hand with his other hand.\nThe couple of women gestured as they spoke. “The death cart can’t be that old, right? It should’ve spoiled by then!”\nSick handed the three children the chocolate candies which he had promised a few days ago.\nHe gave John a secretive smile. “John, I can monitor them like I usually did.”\nJohn frowned. “You can, but your spell is only good at ‘invading others’ privacy.’”\n“But like all things, there are always exceptions. I make it a point to divulge the information that I believe should be public.”\nJohn’s frown reached his neck.\nSick returned the orb which John had given him. “See to it that your wife doesn’t have her usual outbursts again, alright?”\nHe left.\nJohn watched him leave, and his mouth was wide open.\nSick forgot to remove his apron, and it was bright-pink.\nA guard reprimanded Sick and fined him for wearing the apron out in the streets.\nJohn shifted between his legs and guessed the distance of the sun now in view of several seconds ago.\nWhen night came, John returned home where Amanda and her friend waved their hands around.\nJohn grabbed a bunch of bananas and split it in half. He handed one half to Amanda’s friend.\nAmanda’s friend taught Amanda magic related to basket strengthening.\nWhen John and Amanda’s son entered the room, Amanda’s friend bowed and said: “Just test the barrier. Don’t let it reach too deep. Treat it like a lamb. It needs to be calm when you’re shearing it.”\nThe child raised his hand, willed a portal to appear, and grabbed a different wooden toy from last time.\nJohn and Amanda clapped.\nThe child leapt, clapped, and tripped. He created a portal to stop his leg from hitting the ground.\nThe child had created two portals between their hands when they clapped their hands.\nTheir hands disappeared and appeared, but when John noticed it, he stopped his hands and Amanda’s.\nAmanda’s friend covered her mouth elegantly and nodded. “Woohoo! Nonetheless, he won’t hurt you.”\nAmanda dropped her jaw. “Can he take care of himself now?”\nAmanda’s friend nodded.\nAmanda fell to her knees and cried, grinning behind her hands.\nJohn tapped her on the shoulder and told her to stand up.\nAmanda stood up.\nJohn prompted Amanda to tell her friend to leave.\nAfter Amanda’s friend left, John told her about Sick’s leaving out of the province.\nAmanda covered her mouth. “He got ordered to!” She sounded offended.\nJohn stared for a few seconds with a pleading expression.\nAmanda composed herself and relaxed her shoulders.\nJohn took a deep breath and sighed. “They hoisted him away from here for the War God Game.”\n“That’s the one where the king tells you you’re not good enough?”\nJohn chuckled. “Exactly.” He stood up and invited her outside.\nThey included their son and left, stopping beside a store where hundreds of tiny toy monkeys screamed and cried.\n“They really don’t want to turn those things off.”\n“They really want to, but people like it when there’s some noise beside the human booms.”\nAmanda nodded. “Right, as a person who had grown up far away from all that, might I ask what it’s like?” She sounded matter-of-factly.\nJohn pressed his lips together. “Imagine a small boat—”\n“No, I mean, specifically.”\n“I’m getting there, I’m getting there.”\n“‘Kay…”\n“Imagine a small boat where hundreds of people row. That’s that.”\n“That’s it?”\n“Their rowing somehow creates these loud booms, and it’s a human sound since the rowers are the ones generating all that noise by transmitting their mana. In reality, it’s their souls’ screaming that gets ‘boomed out.’”\nA human boom sounded and reached John and Amanda’s ears.\nJohn chewed and swallowed. “Like that?”\nTheir son, whom they placed inside a tall, wooden basket, cried, but a nanny emerged and cast a spell that calmed him.\n“Right,” John said. “Doesn’t it sound a little different?”\nAmanda nodded. “I don’t know.” She was so focused on listening and showing that she was listening that she nodded out of habit.\nJohn opened his mouth. “Either way, let’s eat.”\nThey grabbed a bowl and asked for mushroom soup.\nThe store-owners handed him a change of seven copper coins, two silver coins, and one gold coin.\nJohn praised the soup’s taste, but Amanda chewed it with a dissatisfied expression.\nWhen they left, Amanda greeted one of the two women from a while ago and showed them John’s new clothes.\nJohn struck several, sexy poses and raised his leg even.\nThe women nodded several times and praised him in simple words.\nAmanda laughed, but she also whispered to them a warning not to go too wild.\nJohn laughed, jokingly asking the two women for forgiveness with hands of prayer.\nJohn handed them the orb which he had gotten back from Sick. “Tournaments?” He gestured with his implication with his eyes.\nThe two women danced a little, imitating their children.\n“The children haven’t forgotten it!” said one of the women. “They were so ingrained in that. I haven’t forgotten!”\n“Same thing with Adrian,” said the other. “He was utmost voracious about the whole contentment part of the event where you slash and swing your legs like some peacock!”\nThey both sounded energetic, getting a glanced from onlookers.\nJohn turned his chair around. “Is Shiela coming?”\nAmanda’s eyes were open and staring at the table. She was slouching.\nJohn massaged her where her knee was. Amanda wore exquisitely colorful, tight clothes.\nAmanda glanced at him, and her face lit up.\nJohn forced a smile after he had heard the violent imagery that the two women described.\nThe two women paused to breathe.\nThey continued talking, but it was about pet dogs.\nWhen John’s posture became tense and his expression became bored, the two women said that someone was calling them.\nJohn raised a cup of water as they said their goodbyes.\nAmanda had been chewing when the two women danced.\nShe faced the store-owners. “What time do you close?”\n“No comment.”\n“What time do you go outside at morning night to buy food?”\n“No comment.”\n“Where do you go to find inspiration?”\n“No comment.”\n“How long does this stay open on average?”\n“No comment.”\nJohn and Amanda left.\nThey walked up to a set of gates. The gates looked desolate, and the etchings on them were only vulgar and offensive. A long circular rim at the top part of the gates carried hundreds of sleeping goblins. Each of them wore colorful, distinct clothes.\nJohn, Amanda, and their son observed the goblins’ breathing and the shades of their clothes.\nHundreds of goblins teenagers emerged from a cave near the gates and ruined the trees and vegetation. They screamed and threw their rage at nature, grabbing leaves and tearing them apart. Their voices were devilish and piercing.\nJohn and Amanda’s son cried as hundreds of bats flew and passed the goblins.\nThe goblins rejoiced and cheered. “Woohoo! Yahoo! Yaho!”\nTheir voices became calm and pleasant.\nThe bats formed and transformed into a man with silver hair and black clothes. A large spear five times taller than he was flew above him, lying down.\nSeveral groups of hooded travelers behind John and Amanda ran past the gates and disappeared.\nJohn and Amanda ran too, but they stopped before they passed, seeing the strange silver-haired man turn his head toward them.\nThey yelped.\nA tall piston pushed John, Amanda, and their son’s dead bodies into a vertical shaft.\nBy reason of the natural process of the gates’ magic, their bodies became alive again, and they breathed.\nThey stood up, and Amanda frowned, almost crying.\nJohn placed his hand over her head and pointed toward the shadow his hand made. “That’s me. I’m still here.”\nAmanda calmed down and hugged John’s arm as they walked toward a tall statue with etchings of hundreds of offensive symbols.\nSome of them John knew, but Amanda knew all of them.\nThe statue turned into a small boy that pointed toward a wall of darkness.\nJohn and Amanda entered, patting their sleeping son on the side of the head.\nAmanda grabbed a scroll from her pouch and a small compass from John’s pouch.\nJohn tied a rope which he had brought out before they disappeared. “One, two, three.” He whispered. He turned the rope into a hitch, fastening it onto another rope and around his pouch’s opening. He fastened the other rope around a small, red orb. When he pushed it away by accident, the red orb floated through the air.\nAmanda leapt and hit her chin on the ground, but she grabbed the orb.\nJohn and Amanda put the orb on the ground, and when he whispered an incantation, the orb turned stiff and heavy.\nJohn and Amanda entered a portal through the wall of darkness and disappeared.\nTheir bodies shook and flew about.\nThey hit the walls and the ground in the darkness.\nTheir bodies scraped against the walls, but it regenerated magically.\nJohn and Amanda appeared, their clothes returning to what they were before they entered.\nThe orb exploded, and its pieces slammed against the statue.\nJohn and Amanda each held a broken rope, but they smiled.\nAmanda reached inside a basket she and John carried and patted John and her son.\nJohn joined her.\nJohn bumped into a branch, and his feet scraped against vegetation.\nA warty pig fell from a tree and hit the ground, but it stood up and walked well.\nAmanda pointed at a group of finches that cut a branch off and carried it away.\nJohn and Amanda grabbed a small toy in the middle of a glade and left.\nThey returned home, and John lounged near a pile of boxes where a giant, bulky man picked it up litter of shreds of books.\nThe man pointed toward a two-seat table. He walked up to it, sat down, and plucked the armband around its symbol.\nJohn squinted for a split-second when he saw the symbol. Yet, he accepted the man’s invitation and opened his mouth: “The chocolate candies are here, and Jared too published his book.” His tone suggested teasing.\n“It’s not just ‘chocolate candy’ anymore.”\n“Semantics?”\nThe bulky man stared at him for a few seconds, shaking John’s hand with a strong grip.\n“Hmm?” John raised a brow.\nJohn and the bulky man turned around and noticed the purple and white clothes of a passerby.\nThe bulky man’s tone changed, and he chuckled. “No, not semantics. I’ve been experimenting with different flavors and ingredients. I call them ‘gourmet chocolate candies’.”\nJohn smiled. “Sounds delicious. Can’t wait to try them.”\nThe bulky man handed him a small box of the candies. “Here, try these. Tell me what you think.”\nJohn opened the box and took one of the candies out. He took a bite and closed his eyes, savoring the taste. “Wow, this is amazing. The flavor is so complex and rich. I can taste hints of coffee and nuts. Great job.”\nThe bulky man beamed with pride. “I’m glad you like them. I’ve been working on perfecting the recipe for months.”\nJohn nodded. “It shows. These candies are something special. I’m sure they’ll be a hit with the locals.”\nThe bulky man nodded. “I hope so. I’m planning on selling them at the market next week. I’d appreciate your help in promoting them.”\nJohn smiled. “Of course, I’ll help spread the word. These candies are something special, people need to know about them.”\nThe bulky man nodded, grateful for John’s support. “Thanks, I appreciate it.” He chortled.\nThe passerby whom they had noticed went out of earshot.\nThe bulky man’s tone returned to normal. “Dang near twice dead. I avoided that arrow you and your friends pulled. That small, little drake was for me.”\nJohn jokingly scoffed. “I’d like to hear about that when Sick’s gonna be holding the group accountable.”\n“Sick? That’s the son of a man who tried to chase my goslings.”\n“Oh, your goslings, pitiful, isn’t it?” His tone was disbelieving.\nThe bulky man smiled and shrugged. “Can’t be jealous when you have three wives in one.”\nJohn pursed his lips. “Up above, there’s a world where you and Sick can be friends.”\n“Closer than grapes? We can… All he has to is…”\nJohn continued what he was saying, “… eat a bunch of grapes and die.”\nThe bulky man frowned for the first time during their conversation.\nJohn showed an open hand. “The man is not dead yet. Take it from me. Believe that he’s not yet dead at this moment.”\n“You think I’m that heartful? I’ve already pressed against his family time and time again. If I had a choice, I’d mock it and slice.”\nJohn closed his eyes for a few seconds and opened them. “Can’t have dogs if you can’t have…”\nHe craned his head and showed him an expectant stare.\nThe bulky man wrinkled his nose. “What?”\nJohn raised his brows.\nThe bulky man laughed at John’s candid expression. “What? No, what? Seriously?”\nJohn compressed his lips. “You… Whatever. You’re still fine anyway since you and Sick share a plantation.”\nThe bulky man cried and laughed at the same time.\nJohn left in a hurry, but he left a long letter Amanda wrote in John’s words.\nWhen the sun set, a couple of ogres had inspected a dead horse. “What’s up with that?” One of them rubbed his fingers against a horse tail, feeling its softness.\nThe other ogre said: “Pretentious like that.”\nThe ogres greeted the running John.\n“They got the mage-casters on the ceiling about to pounce,” said the second ogre.\nJohn handed them the bulky man’s letter. “It’s that serious?”\nThe ogres forced a smile and nodded, the flaps of their chin making squeaky noise.\nJohn handed them another letter. “This is Amanda’s.”\nThe ogres nodded again.\nJohn handed them another letter. “This is Thomas’.”\nThe second ogre’s expression became disappointed. This ogre turned around, handing it to the first ogre. “See, like this, he puts that all the time.”He snickered, his overbite causing whistle to seep into his voice.\nThe first ogre joined him as he handed John a sack of books.\nJohn left and returned to the bulky man, handing him the sack.\nThe bulky man thanked him, and John received a sack of packed, cold food.\nJohn left and returned home. He handed Amanda the sack and pointed toward a thunderstorm in the distance outside.\nAmanda tied the broken rope which she and John had used at the gates around her arm.\nJohn’s son created two portals. The compass which they had also used at the gates fell continuously through these portals.\nJohn showed his son a sack and opened it, and its smell flew around the room.\nHis son created a portal between John’s neck and head.\nJohn grabbed his neck and pretended he was dead.\nAmanda screamed.\nAfter a whole minute of his son laughing, he reached toward the portal.\nHe tossed it down, treating it like a piece of paper and stepping on it.\n“Muahahaha!”\nAmanda hugged John.\nJohn chuckled, but he stopped when his shoulder became wet. “My clothes… Ey.”\nAmanda continued hugging him and rubbing her head against his neck.\nJohn’s chuckle became nervous. “Did I not tell you he’s fine?”\nThe thunderstorm stopped, and a horde of goblins emerged, fell down, and landed perfectly fine. They charged toward the province Amanda and John were in.\nAmanda left.\nJohn bent over and gestured as he spoke. “Make it stronger and harder by practicing with heavier objects, okay?”\nChapter 2 - Goblin Invasion and Loss linkThe goblins who had fallen from the sky emerged from the trees onto a road. They sprinted past the corner of a cottage, trampling all over a farmer’s field. Hundreds of them looted food and drank. They cheered and stole baskets where they put their valuables. They covered these baskets with stolen cloth, wearing hoods and imitating a child’s walk. They looked like a horde of children when they ran up to a line of houses.\nHundreds of people hid inside these houses. Some of them covered themselves in multiple cloths and clothes to hide.\nThe goblins squeaked when they spoke. “I crave after happy tunes!”\n“I crave after red baskets!”\n“I crave after ceilings too.”\n“The ceilings where mages loom!”\n“They asked us, Parry! They asked us, Marty! They asked us, Cecillia! They did ask us!”\nThey gathered, leapt, and hugged one another. Some of them choked.\n“And we’re here now.”\nThey let those who choked breathe again and scattered.\nThe people sighed in relief.\nJohn said “hi” and opened a door.\nSome of the people froze, but most of them greeted John one after another, shaking his hand and saying his name.\nJohn gave them a smile that reached the eyes and maintained that smile until he left and looked inside the other houses.\nThe three children whom John had handed an orb greeted John.\nJohn held their hands and guided them toward a small well. “Do you want water?”\nThe children nodded, rubbing their eyes.\n“Please don’t rub your eyes!” John sounded tender.\nThe water fell on the children’ legs.\n“Okay.” John tiptoed away, avoiding making too much noise. He turned around. “Raise your leg and wash it under and don’t use all the bucket!”\nThe kids laughed as they poured water over themselves.\nJohn left with a surprised smile, joining Amanda.\nHundreds of dogs ran toward the goblins and joined their march.\nJohn fell to the ground. Bones that belonged to another creature emerged from his back and exited out of his skin.\nAmanda grabbed him and pulled the strange bones out of his back.\nJohn grabbed Amanda’s hand and rubbed it against his face. “Heal me. Quick.”\nAmanda nodded like a woodpecker. She cast a healing spell that failed.\nJohn shouted. “No!”\nAmanda opened her mouth, but she was speechless. She cast the healing spell again and again, but it failed.\nJohn tightened his grasp on her hand. “Stop, stop!”\nAmanda furrowed her brows.\nJohn let her hand go. “I should be fine. I was hoping I could join you in the fight, but go without me.”\nAmanda sat down.\nJohn gave a tired smile. “Go.”\nAmanda ignored him.\nJohn lay down.\nThey stared in different directions and glanced around for danger.\nAmanda pressed her hand against John’s thigh and massaged it.\nJohn closed his eyes and fell asleep.\nAmanda became half-asleep too.\nWhen the sun set, two goblins had passed by her, inspected her body, and sprinted away.\nWhen Amanda got up, she opened a compass and watched it go southward. She threw it away, and it exploded.\nThe three children were watching, their jaws dropped.\nJohn got up. “Stop looking. Go, go, go.”\nThe children joined the rest of those who fled from the goblins.\nA group of a couple of ogres and a bulky man whom John had met guarded those who fled.\nA carriage trundled up to John, and the two soldiers whom John had met jumped off and strangled John.\nJohn fell to the ground and wiggled his body, coughing.\nThe soldiers removed their hands, letting him recover.\nJohn stood awkwardly, pushing himself off the ground with one hand. “You can’t be serious.”\nThe soldiers pointed elsewhere. “You shouldn’t told them to leave earlier,” one of them said, a man with a snarky face and a clean haircut.\n“What?” John imagined Amanda as he rubbed his clothes to remove any dust.\n“They died! You should’ve told them to leave earlier!”\n“Who! Who?” John’s imagination became disturbed, and tears dripped down the imaginary Amanda’s face.\n“The three kids. You were here, weren’t you? Why were they late? They came from here, and you’re the only one with the responsibility to get this done! Son, either go somewhere safe or help us and atone for what you did directly.” The snarky-faced soldier handed John a potion and gestured him to drink fast.\nJohn’s imagination disappeared, and his senses became sharp. The pain he felt stung despite the healing effects of the potion.\n“Blood for blood?” he said.\n“No! Of course not! No one’s getting their blood spilled because someone they cared about died! You dumbie!”\n“Blood for no reason then?” John sounded derisive.\nThe snarky-faced soldier pointed toward the grave of the three children. “Just do the right thing, John!”\nJohn fell to his knees and slowly nodded.\n“Yes?” said the other soldier, a pale-faced young recruit. “Are you going to come?”\nJohn nodded hard, and he pushed himself off the ground and got up. “I… I will join you.”\nThe other soldier cheered with an innocent smile.\nJohn slowly smiled as Amanda tapped his shoulder. She was sitting beside him during his confrontation with the snarky-faced soldier.\nA older man with weak joints emerged from the carriage. He greeted Amanda and John, waving a hand.\nAmanda, the older man, and the soldiers imitated John’s infectious smile.\nAmanda raised a small hand. “Where have the goblins gone?”\n“Far north near the trees,” said the snarky-faced soldier.\n“Seven of them probably contacted some sort of disease if they’re hiding in a cave somewhere.” John rested his chin on the palm of his hand.\n“Closer to us than we think.” Amanda climbed a tree and sat on a low branch. “They’re most likely deep inside the province.”\n“North?” The older man stretched his hands and back, whimpering when he made a bad twist. “Why north?”\nThe snarky-faced soldier squatted. “It’s faster that way and more effective since they can climb well.”\nThe older man strode toward John until he was face-to-face with him. “Why the disease, John?”\n“They could be manipulating the diseases too well that one of them caught it.” John tapped and plucked around his back. “I got the bones.”\n“The bones?” The older man grew tense as he strode around. “What’s the bones?”\n“The bones spell is one where hundreds of goblins sacrifice a body part.” John sat on the ground, dirtied his hands, and rubbed most of the dirt off them. He took a joking tone. “And hundreds of people get bones on their backs. It’s horrible. I’ve tried it myself.”\nAmanda tapped him with a half-disappointed, half-amused look.\nThe snarky-faced soldier raised his hands and tilted his head toward a tiny pool of water. “They could be hiding near the river north.”\nThe older man struggled to squat and tripped. “Okay, James, before that, how about what John said?”\nThe soldiers helped him up.\n“It’s the bones spell.” The snarky-faced soldier named “James” gestured toward the carriage. “I’ve only heard it as much as I’ve seen it myself. No one talks about it because it’s unprecedented.”\nThe soldiers brought the older man to the carriage and handed him a pouch of water.\nThe older man sat down and drank from this pouch. “Half of those who lived here died.” He sounded depressed.\nHe dropped the pouch by mistake.\nJames caught the pouch and returned it. “This situation calls for it to be a problem, but history likes to get the best and the worst.”\nThe older man leaned over toward the soldier and whispered.\nThe soldier nodded and turned his head toward Amanda. “Might I please know your name?”\nAmanda nodded. “I am Amanda Lee.”\n“How did you get your name?”\nAmanda stared at the pool of water where James tilted his head.\nShe took a long, deep breath for over ten seconds.\n“From my birth-father, and my stepfather agreed to keep the name despite a tradition in his family to change names regarding his faith.” Her tender voice carried hints of repulsion and admiration.\nThe older man joked. “I did not need that. Too long. Did not expect that.”\nThe soldiers dropped their jaws.\nAmanda and James showed easy, polite smiles.\nThe older man covered his head and eyes, glancing in the soldiers’ direction. “Either way, since we’re up here, we should go down the mountain.” He coughed, blinking hard. “You guys go do what you need to do. I will be with you shortly.”\nJames whispered to the younger soldier, and the younger soldier scurried up to Amanda and James.\nAmanda and John stared at the older man, furrowing their brows in concern.\nThe younger soldier slapped his hips to get their attention. “Morning.”\nAmanda turned toward John, and John turned toward Amanda.\n“What?” John stretched his arm behind himself.\n“They’re coming. The team.”\n“Who?” Amanda yawned.\nThe younger soldier wrinkled his nose. “They’ll take care of the fighting with you.”\nJohn smiled. “Fighters, alright.”\nThe soldiers joined the older man, and their group left.\nJohn and Amanda left and visited the grave of the three children.\nAmanda broke into tears.\nJohn’s voice was weak.\nThey grieved for them.\nWhen the sun reached its peak, a group of teenagers had emerged from the trees and sprinted up to John and Amanda.\nThese teenagers separated themselves and adopted elegant poses. “We’ve been sent to fight with you.”\nJohn and Amanda shook each of their hands with tender smiles and introduced themselves.\nThe teenagers lowered their heads somewhat.\n“Let’s discuss how we’re going to fight them, shall we?” John said.\nThe teenagers trembled with excitement. “Yes, John and Amanda!”\nJohn and Amanda glanced between one another and the teenagers, waiting for them to introduce themselves. Their glances showed obvious prompting.\nOne of the teenage boys swallowed.\nAnother teenage boy stepped forward. “I’m Handsome.”\nJohn pretended he misunderstood, covering his mouth. “Apparently!”\nAmanda grinned. “He’s kidding. Hi, Handsome.”\nThe teenager named “Handsome” widened his eyes for a whole second, making himself terribly obvious.\nAmanda gave John a knowing look.\nJohn imitated Amanda’s grin. “My son would like to meet some of you if he knew.”\nThe teenagers glanced at one another with half-scolding, half-amused looks.\nAmanda sounded serious. “Excuse me, John, might I please ask if we are heading toward the gates?” She preferred sounding polite in front of the teenagers.\nThe teenagers turned their heads toward John.\nJohn posed and gave an enthusiastic thumbs-up, opposing Amanda’s seriousness.\nAmanda rubbed her forehead as her sweat slip down the tip of her nose.\nThe goblins slept inside a small camp where hundreds of ants traveled across their bodies.\n“Yo! I’m sleeping here. Get me a pillow.”\n“We have no pillows. Want to sing a song?”\n“No! I’m tired!”\n“Yeah, we’re tired!”\n“Me too!”\n‘Alright, then, I’ll be leaving.”\nA goblin trudged outside of the camp and spotted Amanda giving John a massage.\n“Yo, guys, little ones out here doing some bondage.”\n“Those guys are not little, but hey, they’re a tad bigger than normal.”\n“What’s up with them?”\n“Killing them?”\n“No, I mean ‘What’s ‘up up’ with them?’”\n“Strange people that’s for sure. Let’s kill them, alright?”\n“Right.”\n“Alright!”\nAmanda and John handed the teenagers handkerchiefs for their sweat.\nThe teenagers thanked them as the goblins sprinted up behind them.\nJohn leapt and blocked the way.\nThe goblins slammed into John.\nJohn jumped away and tripped.\nThe group of teenagers, around 60 in number, pulled their crossbows and aimed.\nAmanda helped John up.\nThe goblins, around 5,000 in number, retreated to avoid the arrows, preferring self-preservation over an easy victory.\nThe teenagers relaxed their bows and sprinted away alongside Amanda and John.\nThe goblins charged. They had increased their speed twicefold when their targets ran the short 100 meters in the very long 20 seconds.\nJohn grabbed a rock, whispered an incantation, and shot it.\nThe rock exploded, and its tiny pellets slammed into the goblins.\nThe goblins stopped and rubbed themselves, bleeding.\nJohn and Amanda sprinted away away from a hill.\nThe teenagers ran behind this hill and climbed it, raising their bows.\nThey shot their arrows, and a goblin at the front caught all the arrows.\nOne of the goblin men cursed. “Olato got made.”\nThey marched away.\nJohn and Amanda sat on their haunches.\nJohn rubbed his nose. “Do they have something else to do?”\nAmanda grabbed her pouch and grabbed packaged food. She handed it to John.\nJohn grabbed it.\nAmanda handed the teenagers some packaged food.\nThey ate and drank.\nWhen darkness came, they had left, rested somewhere hidden, and left again.\nThey walked up to the gates which John, Amanda, and their son had visited.\nThe goblins pitched camp there for the night.\nJohn, Amanda, and the group of teenagers joined a large group of people that surrounded the goblins.\n“What in the world are they doing?”\nJohn and Amanda stared for several minutes.\nJohn sounded nice. “They look normal. Should we bother them?”\nA group of goblins among the mass of goblins waved balls of light toward John and Amanda. One of the goblin men dropped a painting depicting the dead goblin named “Olato” with his hands outstretched in front of his favorite food. Their faces looked forlorn and wasted.\nHowever, as John stared, their lost expressions shifted to rage.\nThey ran, waking up their goblins and sending a grandiose message.\n“They’re here!”\n“The hateful!”\n“The tyrannical!”\n“The monstrous!”\n“We should remove them! Break their tendons!”\nTheir voices were musical.\nThe goblins who had moved on from Olato’s death in a blink of an eye woke up, grasping weapons and protective gear. They stood, joined the singing, and entered into formation.\nJohn’s face changed.\nHe covered his disgusted expression. “This is hypocrisy. They killed children.” His voice contained venom.\nAmanda raised her hand and adopted a thinking pose. “A talk. A talk will gain something.”\nA group beside Amanda heard her and nodded. “Let’s tell whoever’s in charge.” They bounded away alongside Amanda and John.\n“Stop the plans to fight!”\n“Don’t fight!”\n“No fighting!”\n“We are against fighting!”\n“Please don’t fight!”\nThe shouting in favor of pursuing peace talks with the goblin group soared as John and Amanda spread the message.\nA tall woman gave a tender smile toward John and Amanda and greeted them with a bow. She gestured to the onlookers of people crowding toward her. “I’m Sophia, the mover of these people.” She pointed to a group of men beside her. “And these men are my husbands.”\nAmanda hid her surprise, glancing at John.\nJohn gave a composed smile. “We are against fighting the goblins. Can we give them what they really want?”\nAmanda widened her eyes, failing to hide her surprise.\nThe tall woman named “Sophia” noticed and gave a couple of big nods. “No, too dangerous I think. I’m not the one deciding ‘that that,’ but right now, do tell me why fighting them won’t end up in a win-win in the long run. They carry bombs that’ll destroy the kingdoms from the inside out.”\nAmanda raised a closed fist. “What are you guys talking about? Bombs?”\n“Conceptual.”\nAmanda squinted as her expression grew tense.\n“Not the actual.”\nAmanda raised a brow, widened her eyes, and compressed her lips.\n“Metaphorical.” John sounded serious and somewhat guilty.\nSophia and the group of men giggled.\nAmanda grabbed John’s arm with a tender smile.\nJohn clasped his forehead, covering his eyes, looking somewhat embarrassed.\nThe group of men showed Sophia expectant glances, and Sophia nodded.\nThe men handed Amanda and John some cheesecake.\nJohn and Amanda thanked them, and they ate.\nShe gestured, raising a packaged cheesecake. “We can end it today, but only if they accept this meal. I can do it myself, but you can try since I’m open to either war and peace.”\nJohn and Amanda showed their surprised smiles, turned around, and finished their food.\nSophia rested her chin on the palm of her hand. “Hello?”\nJohn turned around and back several times before he realized.\nHe gave a thumbs-up for the food. “Yes?”\nSophia glanced at the meal for the goblins on her hand.\nJohn raised his shoulders. “Oh, I’m sorry!” He grabbed it and bowed. “Thanks for the food!” He turned around.\n“Chic lavender and mustard.” Sophia paused midway through her return to resting position. Her smile was awkward.\nJohn wore a purple gown layered over yellow trousers. His face outside of Sophia’s view, he raised a brow and left. He took her words as a compliment despite his distaste with the use of the word “mustard.”\nSophia continued her return to resting position and stood at ease. She turned toward the group of men beside her, and the men showed her a map.\nThe map displayed a couple of balls of light that moved at the same time John and Amanda did. It showed their location.\nSophia stretched her back. She raised her brows, showing her approval.\nA goblin connected a couple of his fingers and bit their thick, square-shaped nails from top and below. “What’s up with you guys? You’re mad, but I’m not. Do you really want to fight ‘right right’ now?”\nA goblin fell to the ground as arrows struck it.\nAs the goblins yelled, the group of teenagers alongside whom Sophia and John had expected to fight reloaded their crossbows.\nA goblin rubbed her face and covered her mouth. “Stop! Stop! Stop!”\nJohn and Sophia sneezed, paused, and said “Excuse me.”\nAmanda handed John his handkerchief from his pouch.\nSophia drew lines on a map as mud walls emerged from the ground where she drew.\nThese mud walls emerged and formed a enclosure around a group of goblins closest to John and Amanda.\nSophia touched the drips from her nose. “Ugh.”\nJohn and Amanda imitated the goblin shouting “Stop!” John ran toward the teenagers, and Amanda ran toward Sophia.\nThe teenagers shot a volley of arrows as Sophia drew a line.\nA group of seven men, a couple of ogres, and a bulky man whom John had met blocked Amanda’s way.\nAmanda widened her eyes, covered her mouth with one arm, and flailed her other one as he ran.\nJohn bit his lip, struggling against cursing.\nChapter 3 - Shifting Alliances and Unexpected Betrayal linkSophia smiled with expectant eyes.\nThe teenagers gathered together. “Woohoo!”\n“Let’s go!”\n“Stop holding it like that! I said relax!”\n“Alright!”\nThe goblins marched toward the teenagers, stone-faced with hints of disappointment.\nJohn showed the group of teenagers a package of food. “Guys, stop, you hungry? Let’s eat!”\n“We’re fine.” They shot a goblin dead.\nJohn grabbed them by the shoulders. “Stop! Don’t kill them! We don’t need to fight!”\n“Fighting is fun!” They walked outside of John’s reach.\nJohn pretended he was sorry, falling on his knees and begging them.\n“Stop. Stop doing that. Stop putting yourself down.” The teenagers’ expressions looked disappointed.\nAmanda raised her hands and begged Sophia to stop.\nSophia blinked several times for a few seconds before she turned her head toward Amanda. She stared. “What?” She sounded confused.\n“Is there anything I can do for you?”\nAmanda furrowed her brows. “What?” She sounded more confused than Sophia.\nSophia smiled. “Is there anything I can do for you?”\nShe drew a line.\nAmanda’s voice grew hoarse as she said “Stop!” repeatedly. Her voice was weak since she had been awake alongside John for over 24 hours.\nThe group of goblins who had woken up the rest of the around 5,000 goblins emerged. They stabbed some of the teenagers with one arm, and the teenagers fell to the ground.\n“Hail to Olato!” The goblins fled on four legs.\nJohn sounded exasperated. “Oh no!”\nAmanda grabbed a sheathed dagger from her pouch, unsheathed it, and aimed it at the bulky man whom John had met. “You… why are you still here?”\nThe bulky man frowned. “You think I’m a Johnson like Sick is?”\nAmanda looked down. “I can’t do this anymore. John is fine, but me, with all this?”\nThe couple of ogres whom John had met stepped forward and overshadowed her.\nAmanda calmed her shaking. “This is wrong, and you know it.”\nThe ogres grabbed her and tied her against a tree slimmer than her. “She’ll be fine.” They sounded warm and pleasant.\nJohn opened his pouch and put his hand inside. He furrowed his brows when he touched the pouch of coins which Amanda had given him. He took out the pile of cups which he had brought home.\nHe threw the cups, and the ground turned into slippery ice. The cups disappeared into smoke.\nJohn and the teenagers struggled and fell.\nThe teenagers cursed. “What is this! What’s going on!”\nJohn grabbed them and tied them up. “Don’t move!”\nThe teenagers stared at him with grieving expressions.\nJohn moved the bodies of the dead teenagers and placed them face up side by side. “Guys, you’re grieving, and we’re in a war.” He sounded caring and forgiving.\nHe left and climbed into a mud wall enclosure where a group of goblins ran and avoided crocodiles.\nHe shook his head and groaned. “Sophia!”\n“I’ll help you!” He sprinted toward the goblins.\nThe goblins shook their head.\nJohn climbed the enclosure and extended his hands. “Grab my hand!”\nThe goblins grabbed his hands one by one, and he pulled them outside.\nJohn stared at them, and the goblins stared back.\nJohn nodded.\nThe goblins’ surprised expressions shifted to joy as John clapped.\nThe goblins shouted, panting. “Yes!”\n“Woohoo!”\n“Yey!”\nJohn stared at them as their expressions shifted to grief.\n“Damian!”\n“Matthew!”\n“Richard!”\nJohn frowned, and he offered them his dirty handkerchief.\nSeveral goblins accepted and wiped their tears.\nJohn left.\nAmanda removed herself from the tree to which the ogres had tied her, falling to the ground.\nThe ogres chuckled and grabbed her, stopping her from running.\nAmanda took out the scroll which she had taken out at the gates. “Do you want to go to the island? Here!”\nThe bulky man grabbed his hair. “You…” He sounded surprised and suppressed his happiness.\nHis expression shifted to annoyance as Amanda walked forward.\nThe bulky man pointed at Amanda. “I did it already. I paid the price.”\nAmanda opened her mouth slowly. “W-what price?”\n“You know.” The bulky man sounded betrayed.\n“Jared, can you tell me what’s wrong? Seriously.”\nJared raised his hands face up and looked at them, his eyes wet. “You didn’t give me the money I needed. I needed it to leave with Sick!”\nThe ogre bent over and showed Jared their stone-faced expressions. “Be quiet.”\nJared lowered his head and slowly turned away, and the ogres returned to their rest position.\nAmanda touched an embroidery design depicting a basket on her pouch. “She’s expecting.”\nJared stopped, his eyes wide. He gave the ogres a secretive glance. He raised his hand from the corner of his legs.\n“What are you doing!” Sophia stood and raised a hand.\nThe ogres collapsed and fell unconscious.\nJared turned toward Sophia, and midway through raising his hand, he collapsed and fell unconscious.\nSophia fell to her knees with a groggy expression.\nThe crowd watching the fight became noisy.\nAmanda dropped her jaw and ran toward Sophia. She grabbed a rope from her pouch.\nSophia let out a weak groan and mouthed “Jared.”\nThe group of men whom Sophia had married entered into a shield formation in front of Sophia.\nAmanda stopped. “What are you doing?” She stuttered, and her head trembled. She blinked fast and shut her mouth, yawning. She collapsed.\nThe group of men grabbed her and tied her up against a tree slimmer than her.\nJohn collapsed halfway through his sprint to Amanda, and the goblins whom he had helped took care of him.\nHe became half-awake, and the goblins offered him an energy potion.\nJohn nodded, and the goblins made him drink.\nJohn’s groggy stare wandered. He saw a carriage.\nJames jumped out of it and sprinted toward him, raising a mace.\nJohn got up, and his tired senses became sharp.\nJames lowered his weapon and greeted him.\nJohn greeted him back.\nJames showed him a map. “We found you.”\nA group of a younger soldier and an older man whom John had met emerged from behind James. They gestured toward an army of 100 men behind them.\nJames smiled. “Can you save Amanda with that number?” His voice grew regretful as he spoke because he thought he sounded rude. “The energy potion is kicking in. Apologies.”\nThe older man handed him a box of potions. “This is enough?”\nJohn chuckled.\n“I’m serious. If this saves Amanda, we should be good for the long term right?”\nJohn chuckled nervously.\nThe older man’s voice deepened his voice. “Hey, John. Do you read me?”\nJohn nodded fast.\nA soldier wearing an apron sprinted toward John and greeted him, waving at him.\nJohn took a stance. “Who are you?”\nThe soldier gestured toward the older man.\nThe older man nodded, showing his approval for the apron soldier.\nJohn showed a polite smile.\nThe apron soldier shook John’s hand. “No comment.” His helmet muffled his voice.\nJohn returned to his rest position. “Amanda’s favorite store? You’re the guy with the girl?” He sounded rude.\n“I have food if you guys want. I’m only here for that apparently.” The apron soldier sounded polite. He pulled up his visor. He showed a half-bitter and half-amused smile, avoiding John’s questions.\nJohn furrowed his brows, forgetting he had regretted his rudeness.\nThe older man extended his hand toward John. “Amanda is there, John. Why are you stalling?”\nThe apron soldier offered John mushroom soup.\nJohn turned his head around and sprinted away. “Amanda!” His voice was a whisper.\nThe older man, James, the younger soldier, and the apron soldier chortled and marched behind John.\nThey and the 100-man army sang and blew horns and trumpets, preparing to charge.\nJohn ran up to Amanda and freed her. “You’re okay, Amanda. I’m here. I’m here.”\nAmanda was quiet. Tears dripped down her face.\nJohn hugged her.\nThe 5,000-goblin army emerged and surrounded the group of men whom Sophia had married and the groups of people who had gathered under Sophia’s name. Those under Sophia’s name numbered 3,000.\nJohn and Amanda left them and joined the older man.\nThe apron soldier handed John a fresh, clean handkerchief, and John wiped Amanda’s tears.\nThe goblins whom John had helped out of an enclosure spotted John and ran up to him.\nJohn covered his mouth, trembled, and ran.\nHe tripped. “Stop! Don’t kill them!”\nThe older man raised his hands. “Don’t touch them, everyone!”\nThe goblins pointed toward a path behind them and gestured an escape route.\nJohn nodded, but he gestured that he declined.\nThe goblins left at high speeds.\nJohn frowned and sat down.\nAmanda hugged his leg and massaged him.\nJohn smiled.\nThe goblin army, also referred to as the “Roy Army” and the Sophia army, also referred to as the “Sophian Army” marched toward one another.\nThe group of teenagers whom John had tied up freed themselves and pumped their fists. “Yeah! Finally!”\n“We got them!”\n“We were so close to failing, but here we go!”\nAmanda and John fell asleep.\nSick emerged. “Everyone, let’s focus on the positives. I want to introduce myself. This is Sick. This fleshbag of a person. I’ve been gone to focus on better things, but since you guys are messing all about, I thought I might come in and give you all a little chat. No more fighting. No more.”\nHe handed the Sophia army bags of cash and offered to represent the goblins for peace talks in favor of their self-government. He showed his magical, golden rings as proof of his influence.\nWhen Sick and the Roy Army had left and the Sophian Army returned to their camp, Jared, John, Amanda, and Sophia woke up.\nSophia handed Jared a handkerchief. “Seriously? I was doing this for you, and now, you got all that? What a waste! Why?” She sounded amused.\nJared wiped his tears and returned the handkerchief. “I can tell you’re finished.”\nSophia grinned. “Of course I am.”\nJohn and Amanda screamed. “No!”\n“Why!”\nThe couple of ogres whom John had met chuckled. “Calm down, we didn’t lose the war.”\nJohn and Amanda stared for a few seconds.\nJohn pumped his fists. “Yeah!”\nAmanda laughed, tears dripping.\nA group of dressed people visited and greeted them wearing purple, yellow, mourning clothes.\nJohn and Amanda frowned.\nOne of the mourning-dressed men hummed to get their attention. “We visited the grave already. I blame you partly.”\n“Thank you.” Another mourning-dressed man offered them a stack of letters.\nJohn and Amanda widened their eyes, but they looked relieved. John accepted the stack of letters.\n“But in the end, you didn’t watch them die right?” A mourning-dressed woman plucked the necklace around her wrist.\nJohn and Amanda nodded.\nThe first mourning-dressed man strode away and gestured the couple of women whom John had met. “If you don’t see them…”\nJohn nodded normally, and Amanda nodded like a woodpecker.\nJohn and Amanda returned home where a boy greeted them.\nThe boy stood on tiptoe. “They allowed me.”\nJohn and Amanda shook his hands and nodded.\nAmanda tensed her lips. “If they allowed you…”\nHis hands behind his back, the boy followed John and Amanda inside.\nHe greeted John and Amanda’s son with an enthusiastic howl.\nJohn and Amanda smiled. “I love you.”\n“Love you, too.”\nThey went into a room to the right and locked the door.\nThe boy danced and skipped around. “Michael, Michael, look at this.” He slashed at the air and swung his legs like a peacock.\nJohn and Amanda’s son named “Michael” smiled, tilting his head upward. He created a portal behind the boy.\nThe boy offered Michael chocolate candy from Sick’s store.\nMichael ate it, and his portal disappeared.\nSick’s voice emerged inside the room Michael and the boy were in: “Hiya, pass this message to your father Charter, John, and Amanda: ‘“Ennobled and revoked” is caught. All I need to do is discuss land with the lich, and you and I can save the goblins once and for all.’”\nWhen John and Amanda exited their room, the boy told them Sick’s message.\nJohn and Amanda left and entered a small store where a group of adventurers discussed.\n“We’re late.” Amanda blinked fast and shut her mouth, yawning.\nThe adventurers clapped. “Good job, John. I heard you helped Lord Mark and Imperial Secretary Sick.”\n“Why the titles?” John touched his forehead, adopting a thinking pose. “Anyways, just tell me what we have to do. I’ve already too much on my hands since… Whatever.” He sounded rude.\n“High man now, huh?” One of the adventurer men feigned derisiveness, bounding toward John with an willful, arrogant gait.\nJohn bowed his head. “Are we going to explore the same dungeon? Oh, drake was laughing about Jared. Oh, Jared was laughing about the drake.”\nAmanda walked toward the adventurers.\nAll the adventurers chuckled except for one.\nThis one adventurer covered her face. “Yeah, we heard. He’s in prison for the…”\nThe first adventurer crossed her arms. “Book.”\nAmanda placed a basket beside each of the adventurers and sat down. “Guys.” She waved her hands. “The baskets are worth 50. Take it or leave it.”\nThe adventurers crowded into one spot, grabbing their boxes and displaying it to one another. They took out an embroidered handkerchief from each basket and put it on a table.\nAmanda smirked. “What do you think?”\nOne of the adventurer men tapped his handkerchief gift. “Whoa-ho. Very nice. Look at that.”\nWearing trousers, Amanda adopted a relaxed pose. She raised her leg, bent her knees, and rested her elbow on her knee. Her other arm rested on the base of her other leg. “Picked them up from the embroiderers’ yesterday.”\nThe other adventurers imitated the adventurer who had tapped a handkerchief.\nAnother adventurer pressed his buttocks against a table. “Good coloring.”\nJohn gave Amanda a simple smile.\nAmanda looked at him and imitated his smile.\nTheir smiles grew intense as the adventurers admired the handkerchiefs which Amanda had bought instead of the baskets which she had crafted.\nOne of the adventurer men placed the handkerchiefs in one pouch and stacked the baskets. “We were hoping to use the gooselings.”\n“Easily, we can access the Dog Bandits’ through the goblins Amanda and I had met. Charter’s also willing to supply us with the food, although…” John remembered the apron soldier who gave him mushroom soup.\nAlong with the group of adventurers, John and Amanda returned home.\nAmanda’s friend and the boy who had played with Michael greeted them inside the home.\n“Okay, just sit down there. Amanda and I have prepared—”\n“Unlike last time.” The adventurers and Amanda chuckled.\nThe boy who had played with Michael said “Excuse me” and left.\nJohn left to the gates and bounded toward a mess of leaves. “Where are you? I’m going to need one of you to come down here and meet me.”\nAlong with ten other large families of goblins, the goblins whom John had saved emerged and greeted John. Human mercenaries and four-wheeled, horse-drawn wagons hid behind them.\nJohn pressed his arm against his hip. “I’m here to ask if any of you have taken a heard of the Dog Bandits.”\n“No.”\n“Okay.”\nJohn and the goblins went their separate ways.\nJohn returned home and covered his face, regretting leaving in the first place.\nAmanda, Amanda’s friend, and the adventurers chuckled and guffawed when John explained what happened.\nAmanda touched wine on the ground as hundreds of tiny voices screamed in their ears.\nJohn stood on tiptoe and pointed at the ceiling. “Charter, we got the message! Stop giving us your equivalent of a gift!”\nThe wine that emerged and dripped from the ceiling stopped coming and disappeared.\nOne of the adventurer women chuckled. “John, if the goblins have nothing, should we just have Sick handle it? He announced he’s going to the 500-year-old death cart. Maybe, the lich he mentioned could replace the Dog Bandits and become sort of a proxy for Sick.”\nJohn rubbed his palm. “Who knows?”\nJohn and Amanda brought the adventurers outside to the store where they had bought mushroom soup.\nThey sat down and ate.\n“I have Jared’s book—” One of the adventurer men gave a teasing grin.\n“Hey!” John’s voice was a whisper. He gave them a scolding look.\nThe adventurer’s expression became serious. “I think it’s good.”\nJohn’s expression became angry for a split-second, but he composed himself. “You like it when leaders die?” He clasped his hands together, turned his head away, and covered the bottom half of his face. He glanced around the room.\nThe adventurer raised his voice. “No, this might be one of the best books I’ve seen so far. I feel like it could be better if he just released it. Who knows? People like me might see things differently.”\nJohn pinched the skin above his brow. “Really, Jacob?” He hid his interrogative tone and stared.\nAnother adventurer pretended he was aiming with an arquebus hand gun, poking another. “It’s funny! Nah, nah, nah. Oh, no! Oh, no!”\nAnother adventurer ate politely. “It’s impressive! In that story, everyone slept in a tower, and then, everyone woke up. But he was stuck there for years. He became stronger and stronger until he could fight a giant.”\nAnother adventurer raised several manuscripts. “Yeah, and the funniest part is when the golems start showing they can talk, and he gets so surprised. That made me laugh so much!”\nThe adventurer named “Jacob” showed surprise and realization. He compressed his lips and quieted down.\nWhen the adventurers had cleaned their plates, they, John, and Amanda walked home.\nA couple of teenage girls emerged and asked for John’s signature.\n“You were really friends with the Imperial Secretary?” One of the teenage girls shivered. “That’s so cool! Really, I’ve seen him only once, but I’ve already written so many stories about him!”\nJohn imitated their excitement with his gestures and tone. “Yeah! I thought he was weak at first, but he went and did so many things! Makes me feel like I can be like him, but I want to work alongside him!”\nThe teenagers smiled and ran off. “Thanks John! Thank you, too, Miss! You’re gorgeous!”\nJohn composed himself. He and Amanda gave polite smiles and said “Goodbye,” waving their hands.\nThey returned home.\nWhen they had slept, woke up, and prepared themselves, they prepared to leave along with Michael. John covered his face and shoulders and exchanged his purple gown and yellow trousers for a typical adventurer outfit. Michael hid in a covered basket. Amanda exchanged her typical adventurer outfit for a pink slouchy, striped bodysuit that coordinated well with her pink leg coverings.\nThey left and attended a tournament where the boy who had played with Michael had signed up.\nJohn’s tender smile grew wider as he glanced around. “Where is he?”\nAmanda covered her mouth. “Right over there.”\nAdrian was on the ground as a silver-haired, black-clothed man whom John and Amanda had met beat him.\nChapter 4 - Tournament Troubles and Whispers of Conspiracy linkA 50-teenager group whom John had tied up emerged. They ran up to the boy who had played with Michael and pulled him away.\nThe silver-haired man whom John had met pumped his fists. “Alright!”\nJohn, Amanda, and the crowd around them gave a thumbs-down and booed.\nJohn stomped a foot. “Oh come on! The kid was 19 years old, and the man is—what?—70 plus?”\nAmanda took a deep inhale for a shout and chuckled halfway.\nJohn and Amanda left and bounded up to the boy who had played with Michael. Behind the boy, a mother whom John and Amanda had met emerged. She gave them a warning stare and trudged away along with the boy.\nJohn walked up to the mother. “Pursue litigation at the royal court.”\nThe mother chuckled derisively. “For what?”\nAmanda walked up beside John and showed a warning frown.\nThe woman glanced at her and gave her a polite smile. “Amanda, thanks again.” She raised a concealed basket which Amanda had gifted her.\nAmanda nodded.\nJohn raised his brows and tilted his head toward the mother. “The person who beat him deserves mutilation at least?”\nAmanda and the mother frowned.\nJohn glanced between Amanda and the mother. “It’s the norm for thieves. Some of them are already up for public display.” The mother’s frown grew deeper as John spoke.\nJohn gestured with his hands and nodded, showing his sincerity. “I really think you should at least give the competitor person that.”\nAmanda composed herself and only tensed her lips. “John, John, John.”\n“That’s like bottom level—” John turned toward Amanda. “Yes?”\n“I don’t think she wants it.” Amanda gave him an expectant look.\nJohn opened his mouth and stared at her and the mother.\nThe boy who had played with Michael tapped his mother’s shoulder. “Food?”\nThe mother nodded. “You’ll get it, don’t worry.”\nJohn nodded with a resigned expression.\nHe and Amanda said “Goodbye” and left.\nJohn and Amanda entered an adventurer’s guild and greeted a group of adventurer who had eaten with them.\n“Hello, everyone. Hello Jacob.”\nJacob waved at him and looked elsewhere.\nJohn hid his disapproval and followed Jacob’s gaze.\nA man entered the guild and paused, furrowing his brows. He ignored Jacob and John’s stares and sat down.\nJohn walked up to Jacob and tilted his head toward his face. “What’s wrong?”\nJacob glanced at John and widened his eyes slightly when he saw John’s happy face. “Isn’t that Charter?”\nJohn gave a flurry of nods.\nThe man named “Charter” who had ignored Jacob and John glanced at John and gestured him to come.\nJohn ran up to him and sat down. “Is it too late now to say your coffee is not coming?”\n“Can you ask them please? Thank you.”\nAmanda turned toward John and gave him an expectant look.\nJohn bounded up to her and gave her an affirming expression.\nJohn gestured Charter’s want for a cup of coffee.\nAmanda pointed toward the counter of a retail kiosk. “Might as well.”\nAmanda handed the basket where Michael had hid to John, and John placed it down on a table near the adventurers.\nAmanda patted Michael’s head. “Might I please have 32 cups of coffee? And…”\nJohn gestured toward Charter and raised a finger.\nAmanda nodded as she spoke. “One more coffee.”\nA cashier jotted down and glanced at her. “Thirty-three cups of coffee.”\nAmanda touched her own chin and nodded.\nShe stared at the distant adventurers as the cashier jotted down, calculating.\n“Is it really that hard though?” One of the adventurer men laughed.\nThe cashier showed her an expectant smile. “That’ll be 50 gold coins.”\nAmanda nodded, and she and John walked away and sat down.\nA woman handed her 32 cups of black coffee and turned around toward a co-worker. “Please keep the cahier somewhere out of the cupboards.”\nAmanda ignored her and raised her eyes toward the adventurers.\nThe adventurer who had laughed clasped another’s shoulders. “Would they really have found it if they were that serious? Like ‘Elevated’ serious. No way right?”\nAmanda shifted her eyes to the outside. A man outside carried multiple pouches of bread and milk and hurried along.\nJohn massaged her around her thigh. “Are you okay?”\nAmanda blinked many times as she turned her head toward John. “Many people died today.” She sounded quiet.\nJohn widened his eyes. “Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Hmm. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.” His confused voice grew understanding as he spoke, and he rubbed the back of his head toward his nape and shoulder.\nJohn blinked as he looked toward his bouncing legs. Amanda stared at a table, formed a circle with her mouth, and took a deep breath.\nJohn deepened his voice. “Many people lived today.”\nAmanda gave a small nod.\nAn adventurer made wide gestures as he spoke. “‘It can’t be!’ That’s how he said it. ‘No! No! No, no!’ He was so scared, but that was the most exciting part!”\n“Dogdogdog is a real man for crying and not holding back his tears,” said another adventurer. “When I read the ending and got to that scene, it actually made me cry.”\nA group of people who had dressed in mourning clothes entered the store.\nOne of the mourning-dressed women walked up in front of Amanda. “Kimberly said, ‘Adrian is in prison.’”\nAmanda looked toward John.\nJohn showed her an encouraging, urging smile, nodding his head and raising his brows.\nAmanda chuckled out of surprise. Her chuckle grew nervous while the woman who had walked up in front of Amanda stared and raised her brows.\nJohn lowered his head, grinned, and clapped his hands secretively.\nAmanda touched above her brow. “Ok, I’ll discuss first with John.”\nJohn frowned.\nAmanda gave John a naive, pleading look. “Then, I’ll pass by her and Adrian.”\nThe woman who had walked up in front of her gave her a disbelieving look.\nAmanda gave her a confused look, raising her brow. “Up by 7 tomorrow, so it’s not a problem.”\nThe adventurers crowded toward John, and one of the adventurer women gestured in front of John.\nJohn turned his head toward the adventurers.\nThe adventurer who had gestured gave John an expectant look.\nJohn shook his head.\nThe adventurers nodded.\nJacob took out a notebook and placed it on the table.\nThe adventurers turned their heads toward the notebook. Their voices were loud. “Is this a hand-copied version of Jared’s?”\nJacob bit his lip and stuttered. “I found evidence of the death of Aliyah. It’s here.”\nThe adventurers gave Jacob polite smiles. “Jacob is serious. Wow.”\nJacob gave John an expectant look.\nAmanda stood and walked toward the counter.\nJohn joined Amanda, ignoring Jacob.\nHis head turned elsewhere, Jacob followed John with his eyes and balled his fists under the table.\n“Aliyah…” Jacob grabbed a cup of water and drank it as the adventurers’ faces grew bored.\nJohn sat down with an enthusiastic voice. “What’s Aliyah?”\nJared struggled to speak, opening his mouth several times as the rest of the adventurers realized John’s enthusiasm.\nThe adventurers imitated John’s enthusiasm. “Yeah, Jacob, what’s Aliyah? How did you get Jared’s book anyway? Did you go visit him?”\nJacob hesitated to smile, stood up, and turned around toward his pouch on the chair where he had sat. “That’s right.”\nCharter faced Jacob and handed him a cup of coffee. “Bad for your throat, but it helps.” His voice was quiet.\nJacob smiled wide for a split-second. He led John, Amanda, Michael, the adventurers, and Charter outside to a remote place. “Jared said that if there was a king, he should be the strongest and most intelligent. He should be the wisest and provide the most benefit to the country. To that end, the country must give all their control and sense of self to him for him to receive faith power and become a god. The major reason is that gods can utilize magic beyond our current means to elevate our society as a whole. The second major reason is that gods, as a result of their power, lose the weakened morality of a desperate human. He will seek after his most difficult wishes alone because he now has the power to accomplish them. After he accomplishes them, he becomes a stoic as his destiny is bound to his fulfilled identity. From what I understand, Jared meant that all a country needs is to force a king candidate through the wishes of the country until he ‘becomes’ it.”\nThe adventurers nodded at one another with guilty looks.\nCharter frowned. “Aliyah?”\n“The death of Aliyah is the death of a godless kingdom.”\nJohn spoke fast. “With the joint ruling of Chancellor Sophia, Grand Commandant Andrew ‘Jared’ Miller, and Imperial Secretary Sick, the kingdom fared okay by reason of their magical prowess, but this system failed after Jared alongside Sophia attacked Sick’s new growing forces as a declaration of his ‘godly’ ideals.”\nThe adventurers became nervously quiet as John and Jacob stared at one another.\nJohn gave Jacob a friendly smile.\nJacob rubbed his fingers together, hoping John would affirm and advice him.\nCharter clapped. “Either way, it’s a good study. Jacob, right?”\nJacob nodded, glancing at John.\nJohn raised his brows.\nJacob looked away.\nJohn turned toward Amanda. “Want to go home? I almost forgot. You’re supposed to check Adrian.”\nAmanda spoke slowly. “Royal court.”\nJohn gave her an encouraging smile. “I’ll come with you. Mikey might want to come as well. We should bring him.”\nAmanda nodded, turning toward the adventurers.\nCharter laughed. “Jacob, you should try selling these orbs. If you’re the one at the front, they’ll want to listen to since their bodies are getting drained while you wait.”\n“No, I don’t want to.” Jacob sounded relaxed.\nCharter furrowed his brows. “I have a lord in line since they want to take up holy magic. Come on.”\nJohn glanced at Amanda, ran up to Jacob and Charter, and grabbed their shoulders. “Holy magic!” His voice sounded funny.\nAmanda smiled, and Jacob raised his head and widened his posture. He raised his brows as Charter’s eyes grew bored.\n“How would you do it?” Jacob sounded excited.\nCharter’s eyes widened, imitating Jacob’s excitement. “Like I said. Just practice your hands to stop them from shaking. You don’t want to drop the orb or shake while you’re doing your hand waving.”\nJacob nodded as he left alongside John, Amanda, Michael, and the adventurers.\nAlong with the adventurers, John, Amanda, and Michael returned home. Michael stayed behind as the rest left again.\nThey ran up to the gates which John and Amanda had visited.\nA group of adventurers hid their armbands and emerged from a camp nearby.\nOne of the adventurer men sprinted up to John. “Is that Little John?”\nJohn nodded and shook his hand. “Oh, hi Ryan. It’s good knowing you’re still out here helping the goblin poor.”\nThe adventurers with Ryan clapped.\nOne of the adventurer men with Ryan strode up to John. “That’s right! Even without their mage ones, we wouldn’t be so quick to judge. We’ve been giving them gifts lately.”\nJohn and Amanda gave polite smiles.\nAmanda strode away.\nRyan furrowed his brows. “Why’s she leaving?”\nJohn covered his mouth. “She needs to go. Body calls!” He sounded funny.\nRyan pointed at John. “My bad! With your new look, I thought you got yourself an impudent group of comrades.”\nJohn gave a polite laugh. “It’s only expected that you would’ve thought that. Now, what are you sitting out here for?”\nRyan gave a thumbs-up. “We’re blocking the gates. It’s our first attempt.”\nJohn closed his eyes. “Blocking it?”\nRyan gave a flurry of nods. “Uh-huh! And we’re doing it for free!” He guffawed.\nHis group gave him awkward smiles.\nJohn backed away alongside Amanda and the adventurers. “Either way, I think you’re missing something here. We’re not here to do anything much, but Lord Mark—”\nRyan glared. “You lackey for him? John, stronger John, it’s us against you and your John clique.”\nHe and the adventurers with him showed their symbolic armbands, declaring war against the John, Amanda, and the adventurers with John.\nOne of the adventurers with John raised his arms against his chest, disgusted and irritated. “The Dogs!”\nRyan swung his hand at John, grabbed his shoulder, and sliced at his neck.\nJohn stopped his dagger and slashed it with a sword.\nThe steel dagger broke, and John slashed Ryan’s chest.\nRyan dashed backward as a volley of arrows emerged and struck him.\nJohn fell forward, but Amanda grabbed him, saving him from the arrows.\nHe sprinted and yelped when a volley of arrows hit the ground behind him.\nJacob tripped. “Ugh!” He got up.\nThe other adventurers with John yelled. “No, no, no!”\n“Please, please, please!”\nTen large families of goblins whom John had met and another family whom John had saved emerged. Those among the goblins who had shot each produced a skilled longbow result of 12 arrows in one minute.\nRyan and the most of the adventurers with him lost their lives.\nJohn, Amanda, and the adventurers with them and the 11 families of goblins greeted one another.\n“Thank you!”\n“Thanks!”\n“I love you! Thank you!”\nA group of goblin teenagers wearing purple, yellow clothes whom John and Amanda had met emerged in the light in front of John, far away. They gestured for a meeting with someone from the 11 families of goblins.\nA goblin woman strode up to them and greeted them.\nOne of the purple- and yellow-dressed, teenage goblin boys spoke in a different language. “Imperial Secretary Sick is chasing down the lich, but the lich is nearing Enterprise Town. Can we pay you to get them? I don’t need to pay the adventurer residents.”\nThe goblin woman shook his hand and bowed, accepting his proposal. “No need for the payment.”\nThe teenage goblin boy stared. “Thank you.” He sounded embarrassed.\nThe teenage goblins boys joined the families of goblins and marched toward a town named “Enterprise.”\nJohn, Amanda, and the adventurers with them returned home.\nJohn and Amanda paced around their home as their voice grew terrified. “Where’s Michael?”\nWhen it became midnight, John and Amanda had left, met the older man whom they had met, and returned home.\n“Where is he?” John covered his face with both hands.\nSick’s voice emerged. “John? Amanda? Are you guys there? I called you guys, but Michael’s the only one who came. I’m sorry.” He sounded frustrated.\nJohn glared at the door and opened it, sprinting outside.\nAmanda joined him, bumping against the door into the streets.\nThey silently dashed around corners after corners, ignoring the surprised expressions of bystanders nearby. They slowed down due to crowds and the coming and going of a foreign ambassador. They jumped over a small fence, and John injured himself.\nJohn gave a strained chuckle as Amanda picked him up. “Sorry, I became too enamoured by us running like this now that we’re here.” He stared at Michael.\nMichael hugged Amanda.\nJohn grabbed him and picked him up, playfully aggressively hugging and kissing him on the head.\nHe put him down, while Michael hugged onto Amanda’s arm and rubbed his cheek against his elbow.\nJohn, alongside Michael, walked up to Amanda.\nAmanda was touching a bunch of flowers. “Oh, sorry, this reminds me of the three kids.”\nJohn nodded with a brow raised.\n“Let’s not get complacent, shall we?” Amanda kissed Michael’s head and walked alongside John and Michael toward a tower. She looked stone-faced, but her fingers twisted about in frustration.\nAmanda raised her hand, and the sound of glass breaking emerged from her past John and Michael.\nMichael stopped, biting his lip.\nJohn furrowed his brows and bounded up to Amanda. “Amanda?” His voice was hurried and stressed.\nAmanda closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and turned her head toward John. “I broke my barrier. I think I’m doing it.”\nJohn forced a smile. “The lich? If that’s your target… sure.”\nA group of goblins emerged from a building and sprinted away down the road.\nAmanda stopped. “They’re here.”\n“They’re really purple from here.” John glanced at Amanda’s angry eye twitches. “I guess it’s the street lights.”\nA thunderstorm emerged.\nAmanda’s twitches stopped, twisting her torso toward John. “Is that yours?” Her voice sounded tense.\nJohn pointed toward a bunch of bats emerging. “Yes. And those are the…”\nAmanda’s voice became calm. “The half-naked bat man.”\nThe bats transformed into a silver-haired, black-clothed man whom John had seen at the tournament. A spear five times taller than him flew toward him and floated midair, moving alongside the man.\nA bunch of adventurers carrying baskets with potions emerged, put down their baskets, and recovered their bearing. “John, Amanda,” said one of the adventurers beside Jacob whom John had helped persuade to join Carter. “Michael. Is Lord Mark here with us?”\nAmanda dashed at an absurdly fast speed. “He should be here.” Green particles of magic emerged from under her feet as she dashed, grinned, and grabbed John’s shoulder as a gesture of camaraderie to the adventurers.\nJohn smiled despite his shoulder’s discomfort. “The adventurer guild got us all here, huh.”\nThe silver-haired man walked up to John. “Not all of us. Greetings. I’m Peter.”\n“Greetings.” John’s voice was a mumble.\nJohn, Amanda, Michael, and the adventurers with them stared for several seconds.\nThe silver-haired man named “Peter” raised his brows and walked away with the same confident gait.\nAmanda walked up to two of the adventurers and drunk a potion from their basket. “Thank you, Oliver.”\nOne of the two adventurers nudged the other, and this other one named “Oliver” observed Amanda’s haughty, climbing gait.\nOliver raised his legs and kicked the air. “Doesn’t Imperial Secretary Sick teach us not to walk like that?”\nThe other adventurer beside Oliver crossed his arms and leaned forward as he walked alongside Oliver. “Don’t worry. She knows what she’s doing. John taught Sick, and—inadvertently—produced much of his early feats.”\nJohn walked backward and gave them a knowing look. “I heard my name and what you said. That was a lie I said years ago. I forgot to tell you until now.” He awkwardly sprinted away and joined Amanda.\nJohn patted Michael on the head toward the necklace around his neck.\nMichael gave John a confused look.\nJohn nodded and gave him a meaningful glance.\nMichael opened his mouth and nodded clumsily.\nA group of James, the younger soldier the older man, the apron soldier, and the small army whom John had met emerged behind the adventurers. “Good evening, everyone,” they repeated across the adventurers. Their expressions and words were polite.\nJohn smiled and gave a theatrically shy wave as Amanda’s demeanor along with her outfit became grandiose.\nJames and those along with him walked up to John and Amanda. They greeted them and marched alongside them.\nThe adventurers recited a poem, joining their march.\nJohn slowed down and made a split-second expression of fear toward Amanda’s back.\nChapter 5 - The Lich’s Wrath and Amanda’s Power linkMichael tripped, waved his hands around, and hit his knee.\nAmanda gave a fierce chuckle. John gave an excited smirk.\nMichael yelped and grabbed his necklace.\nAmanda grabbed Michael and picked him up, clasping his cheeks.\nJohn grabbed a potion from Oliver from whom Amanda had grabbed a potion. He handed it to Michael, and Michael drank it.\nMichael grinned. “Yummy.”\nAmanda grabbed the empty potion and returned it to Oliver, smiling at the potion.\nJohn nodded toward the healing of Michael’s wound, reading “Carter” on the potion.\n“Carter, eh, he’s so hairy unlike me, who’s so thin and frail.” He touched above his mouth. His tone carried hints of jealousy.\nAmanda gave him a confused look.\nHer look became irritated as John chuckled.\nJohn stared as his probing expression became annoyed. “I’m just joking.” His tone sounded half sincere.\nAmanda’s irritation extended to her hand on John’s shoulder, and she pressed down.\nJohn yelped, imitating Michael’s yelp.\nThe adventurers and the older man’s group maintained the distance and spoke in hushed tones.\nThe older man frowned. “The bright lights. That’s the lich breaking the barrier. He’s declared his position here. Can we get Sick to bring him away from the city somehow? I haven’t heard of Sick’s abilities, but couldn’t he use that throw thing he used on the wraith dragon?”\n“He’s using it right now.”\nThe lich flew and landed beside the older man.\nThe older man cursed.\nA horde of ghouls emerged in the distance, following the lich.\nSick ran and emerged, fighting the ghouls. “Kill him. He’s down.” His voice emerged and sounded behind the older man.\nThe lich screeched. “Chains of Ice.” His voice was deep and illusory as if it vibrated inside the ear.\nSick cursed and shouted. “No!” His voice emerged from his mouth this time.\nThe older man dashed and dodged as a bunch of chains of ice emerged from the lich’s body. A ghost emerged and grew bigger as it waved the chains up and down.\nThe chains struck the older man and created disgusting skin lesions where they hit.\nThe older man escaped. He drank a potion and gained a portion of his healthy skin back. However, much of the skin lesions persisted.\nJohn and Amanda dodged the chains, recovered, and ran up to the older man alongside James, the apron soldier, and the younger soldier.\nThey pulled the older man out of the beating of the chains.\nThe older man’s expression was full of pain.\nJohn and Amanda pointed away. “Back off!” they repeated.\n“What!” James and younger soldier’s expressions wrinkled in frustration. “Why!”\n“For now only!” John pointed toward Amanda’s glowing hands.\nAmanda stretched her hands and shook them back and forth. Her clothes and skin gained a white, ghostly glow. She compressed her lips and took a deep breath. “The Four Seasons!” Four human-sized tornadoes of orange, yellow, blue, and red emerged, sprinting sidelong at the lich.\nThe lich pressed his hands down, and a door emerged from him, chasing the tornadoes.\nThe tornadoes dodged the door and hit the lich.\nThe lich screamed in pain.\nThe adventurers avoided the chains and struck him.\nThe lich struggled to turn around since it had become weak.\nAmanda raised her hand and gestured the tornadoes back to her.\nThe tornadoes disappeared, turned into four paintings depicting summer, winter, spring, and fall, and appeared in front of Amanda.\nAmanda touched them one by one, and her hands glowed again. She ran up to the lich alongside John.\nThey struck the lich on the first vertebra at the back of the neck with one-knuckle punches using the middle finger.\nThe lich fell to the ground backwards and became vulnerable to the adventurers and the small army’s projectiles.\nJames and the young soldier dashed and landed the last blow on the lich. The lich exploded. Sick emerged behind them and clapped. Sick opened his mouth, and his voice emerged and sounded in many homes in Enterprise Town. He smiled.\nMany townspeople dressed in the same clothes ran up to them, greeted Sick, and cleaned up the dead bodies.\nOne of the townspeople grinned toward another. “With 500 ghouls, I’ll be rich!”\n“Purgatory.” The lich emerged from the ground. “I’m so tired, so annoyed with these imbeciles. How could they…” White tears dripped down his face. “My pride, my home, everything… Sick bastards! Let me show what being a villain is like!”\nThe townspeople turned to dust.\nSick vomited and fell to his knees, the blood on his body becoming lesions.\nThe lesions on the old man’s body turned into parasites that ate his body up.\nChains flew everywhere and hit everyone.\nJames, the younger soldier, the apron soldier, the adventurers, the small army, John, Amanda, and Michael panicked and retreated.\n“I knew he had some secret power!” Peter whom John had given the cold stare emerged from a corner.\nJames opened his mouth.\nA group of the younger goblins and the 11 goblin families whom John had met emerged with expressions of guilt, glancing at the human piles of dust of the ground. They held handcrafted stakes.\nPeter stretched his legs and leapt, striking the lich.\nThe lich screamed as he clasped his head. “Why…” He grabbed Peter’s neck, but the goblins attacked all at once and broke his arm off.\nThe lich cried and retreated with its large cape.\nThe goblins placed a stake one by one.\nThe lich stopped and tripped, hitting his face.\nThe goblins collected and purged the lich through weak but collective magic.\nThe lich’s ghost departed.\nAmanda’s expression turned to rage.\nJohn stared at her and remembered Sick’s words. “No.” His voice was weak. He fell to the ground.\nAmanda grabbed the ghost and disintegrated it with her glowing hands. She leapt, tossing her tornadoes toward the goblins.\nThe younger goblins let out devilish and piercing screams and pointed toward numerous piles of felled trees.\nAll the goblins ran.\nThe tornadoes swallowed them, as her body glowed. Her magic grew in power as she picked each goblin off.\nJohn cried softly. “Not again.”\nJames along with the older man, the younger soldier, the apron soldier, the adventurers, and the small army fled and hid behind Amanda.\nAmanda nodded toward them.\nPeter thrusted at her tornadoes and stabbed them away. He cursed at Amanda, dodging her tornadoes until one of his legs touched. He screamed as the tornadoes swallowed him up along with his spear\nAmanda closed her eyes and crouched, sitting down.\nJohn massaged her leg, and Amanda lay down.\nThe adventurers surrounded them and took care of them.\nThe ghouls’ bodies reeked.\nJames, the younger soldier, the apron soldier, the adventurers, and the small army cast some of their magic to destroy the wealth of ghoul bodies.\nWhen the sun rose, John had woken up and apologized to everyone involved with a expression of extreme disappointment.\n“3 months?” Oliver and Jacob covered their mouths.\nJohn nodded beside sleeping Amanda, closed his eyes, and took a deep breath. “I’ll handle the rest. The town was a little over a mining community. We’re a fast-growing people. Sick is glad Amanda grew in power. Charter wants the potions we used to study them. I will be taking care of the rest.”\nOliver frowned. “Goblins? Sick came from the goblins.”\nJohn smiled. “No, no, the goblins are fine.”\nJacob sighed, and Oliver rubbed his hair. “Why?” they repeated.\nJohn rubbed his chin and straightened his posture, looking outside through a window. “Oh, I thought it was obvious. The Amber goblins struck a deal. Don’t worry. This is small. These goblins and families were part of the Elijah goblins anyway.”\nOliver sat down and massaged and shook his leg. “Oh… oh right, the goblins are in an armed conflict… that’s crazy.” He stressed “armed conflict” as if it was some foreign word.\nJacob showed them Jared’s book. “Read this. The goblins and the truths behind them. If you open your mind, you’ll find out.”\nJohn gave him a disappointed look.\nJacob winced out of surprise. He stood up and walked away, his expression hurt.\nOliver watched him. “I’m guessing… Anyways, seriously, I’ll be outside if you’re ready. I’m going to scout the dungeons and check if the dungeons are being occupied by the goblin scouts again…” His voice became anxious as he spoke.\nJohn stared and nodded, pushing himself and sitting up.\nOliver left, mouthing to himself about a plan.\nJohn left through the window. “Alright.”\nMichael stared at him outside. “W-what are you doing?” He held his necklace and put it through a portal he created. He looked nervous.\nJohn pointed toward him and almost tripped. “I’m coming. Wear the necklace, too. We’re outside. Oh, people are watching. Either way, good job on your debut Michael. Oh, right, your Mom will be out for three months.”\nMichael looked at the ground with a confused stare.\nJohn jumped off a low roof and climbed down. “Why did I do that?” He ran up to Michael and shook his head. “You can do it! I believe in you!” He hugged Michael and pretended to cry.\nMichael glanced at John’s back of the head and created a portal.\nJohn disappeared.\nMichael created another portal and pulled him out. “I practiced.”\nJohn frowned, gulping. “This is dangerous.” He tapped Michael and ran off alongside him.\nHundreds of bystanders watched them as they ran.\nMichael’s necklace fell and hit the ground.\nJohn bought a chocolate candy from a stall. “Here, it should calm your magic.”\nMichael nodded and ate it happily.\nA group of mourning-dressed people in purple and yellow emerged behind John and Michael. “Your wife? Is she holding up?” One of them struck Michael on the back of the head.\nMichael yelped and cried.\nThe rest of the mourning-dressed people reached out toward John.\nA couple of teenage girls whom John had met pointed at them. “Guards! Help! They’re attacking John, the friend of Imperial Secretary Sick!”\nA 50-teenager group whom John had tied up emerged beside the girls and ran up to the mourning-dressed people.\nThe mourning-dressed people fought back and threw a lavender purple orb which John had touched.\nA building exploded as hundreds of papers reading “Enterprise Town is occupied by goblin soldiers!” flew.\nJohn dashed and struck them one by one.\nHe stopped the mourning-dressed people from throwing more lavender purple orbs.\nThe 50-teenager group greeted John and arrested the mourning-dressed people.\nJohn walked up to them. “Are you busy?”\nSome of the teenagers laughed. “Of course!”\n“Do you want some mushroom soup sometime? Here’s a card.” He handed them a business card that read “John Lee”.\nJohn joked around Michael as they returned home. Michael’s confused, depressed expression lightened up.\nAmanda’s friend waved at them, waiting for them.\nJohn gestured as he spoke. “Amanda, as you know, is not well.” He opened his mouth, but he covered it and entered his home.\nAmanda’s friend nodded and followed him and Michael inside.\nJohn turned around. “Since Amanda is gone, I’ll be staying at home most of the time. Please only use the bathroom to the left.” His demeanor was polite, but his voice sounded stressed.\nSick’s voice emerged and sounded in John’s home. “I got the lich’s reason for coming here. The goblins struck a deal with him. There’s something about it having to do with the 500-year-old death cart underground.”\nWhen the sun fell and rose, he and Michael had left toward Amanda.\nThey passed by posters for political candidates and ads or banners congratulating people on passing certain professional exams or degrees. One of the banners showed Adrian whom John had met.\nJohn smiled, but he frowned. He ran to a prison and greeted Adrian there. “Adrian, how are you?” His voice was hurried.\nAdrian raised his hand overhead and rubbed the back of his head. “I can fight him.”\nJohn raised his brows. “Say that again?”\nAdrian looked at John in the eyes. “I can fight that man Peter.”\nJohn showed a expression of realization and smiled. “You will.” His smiled disappeared. “Oh no… he’s dead.”\nAdrian compressed his lips. “That works too.” He smiled\nJohn and Adrian stared at one another as Adrian’s expression grew confused.\nJohn broke into laughter. “I cannot believe you’re a nice guy.”\nAdrian frowned. “Isn’t that a bad thing?”\nJohn raised a brow. “What? ‘Nice guy’?”\nAdrian adopted a thinking pose. “It means you’re soft, right?”\nJohn looked for a seat and sat down. “No, no, not at all. Well, you got to be a little soft sometimes, or else the people you like will go nuts.” He rubbed his chin. “Oh, wait, maybe not. It’s different for everyone.” He returned his eyes to Adrian and stuttered. “Either way, it’s your journey.”\nAdrian nodded.\nJohn opened his cell. “As long as you’re with me though, we’re going places literally.”\nAdrian shook John and Michael’s hand and greeted Michael.\nMichael chuckled with the same tone John had. “I know someone like you.”\nAdrian raised his brow. “Who? Who?”\nMichael glanced at John, who gave him a cherishing smirk. “It’s a girl.”\nJohn looked confused and turned around, walking backwards. “Julie?”\nMichael looked surprised and nodded. “How did you know?”\nJohn adjusted his clothes. “She’s the only girl you’ve met.”\nMichael opened his mouth. “Really?”\nJohn gave him an unsure shake of the head, but he soon raised his brows confidently. “Yeah.”\nAdrian stared at the ground as he walked.\nJohn, Michael, and Adrian left and entered Amanda’s room.\nJames and the younger soldier greeted them.\nJames’ voice was solemn. “He’s with me because we’re here to say that he’s dead.”\nMichael tripped and hit his knee. He yelped, but his knee was fine.\nJohn squatted down and pointed toward a chair. “You can sit down there, both of you.”\nMichael and Adrian sat down.\nJames’ voice became sad. “We have to blame you for this. I hope you can pay us enough gold hopefully to stop Jared from getting out of prison. Imperial Secretary Sick is very lenient, but his ubiquitous voice doesn’t stop ensuring citizens to stay awake and work hard. Petty crimes are plenty, but felonies are nowhere to be found. You can’t have that with Jared. I hope you help Lord Mark achieve it.”\nJohn’s expression became disappointed as James spoke. “I trust Jared to do what he needs to do.”\nThe younger soldier with James looked scared.\nJohn touched his lips. “Lord Richard, yes. I’m a traitor. It was me all along. I’m John the traitor, and I’m going to traitor all over you!”\nThe younger soldier named “Richard” with James cringed. “Was that a joke?”\nJohn’s voice was awkward. “Yeah.”\nOkay, enough with that.” Richard grabbed John and tripped slightly.\nJohn’s expression became tense, and John remembered Richard beating him up.\n“Ah, my joints.” Richard handed him a lavender purple orb with a frustrated look, massaging the back of his legs. “Get Lord Charter to stop ‘dropping’ lavender purple orbs around. We can have you take that ‘traitor’ role of yours.” He took a deep breath and gave him a derisive stare. “You’re not funny.”\nJames shrugged with a kind, handsome face and a shoulder-length, messy hairstyle.\nJohn’s shock turned into frustration as James and Richard left.\nJohn took deep breaths and calmed himself down. “I’m the bigger person here apparently.” His voice carried bitterness.\nHe sighed again and again as he, Michael, and Adrian returned homeward.\nJames waved at Adrian. “Adrian, I’ll call you tomorrow. I’m tired right now.”\nA thunderstorm emerged, and John watched it from inside Amanda’s room. “Amanda, do you have an orb?” He took out a cup which he had received from Amanda from Amanda’s pouch. “It was here all along. Anyways, I can use this.” He kissed her and saluted as a goodbye.\nJohn and Michael left and entered their home.\nSick’s voice emerged in John’s home. “I spoke with James and Lord Mark’s son. Don’t worry. I’ll handle it. John, be careful with those cups. You killed a whole town of captives already.”\nAmanda’s friend smiled and greeted John.\nA group of five bandits whom John had seen with the dead Ryan emerged and greeted John. “Please, help us. We’ve stomped our pride, and we want to join you John somehow. Please, let us help you. That’ll be a great help to our pride as warriors.”\n“Dog Bandits. I remember trying to get the lich to replace your place. Now that the lich and the Dog bandits have disbanded, a few others who are a lot messier occupy the underground economy.”\nOne of the bandits covered his mouth. “The Dog Bandits are not dead. We only need you to convince Sick to make a deal with us against the new gang named after former Grand Commandant Andrew.”\nJohn rubbed his sweaty forehead. “That’s stupid. What are you on? By the way, take a seat or something. I don’t like staying here. It’s colder inside.”\nThe bandits agreed and sat down. “If you don’t help us, there’s no chance that Ryan will be able to do anything about—”\nJohn raised his hand. “Ryan’s dead.”\nThe bandits glanced at one another. “He made a deal with the lich.”\nJohn looked at the ceiling. “Charter, tell Sick about this.”\nA drop of wine fell and hit the ground as a gesture from Charter.\nJohn nodded and turned his head as the bandits raised their weapons toward him.\nThe bandits’ expressions were scared. “Was that…?”\nJohn stood up. “I told Sick about your deal.”\nThe bandits sat down. “Okay, okay, that’s good. Hopefully, Sick agrees to fight Andrew’s new gang.”\nJohn raised a brow. “Andrew is in prison.”\nThe bandits looked surprised. “Lord Charter broke him out.”\nJohn gave them a polite smile. “Okay. Good night.” He gestured them outside and closed the door.\nHe returned to his seat, rubbed his head, and made a long, depressed sigh. “Amanda, help me right now. Why you have to be in a coma?” He sounded frivolous.\nSick’s voice emerged. “I can help you with that. Just tell Julie to join hands with you because I’m giving you an opportunity to join the War God Game. Michael, too, if he can contain his ‘portal excitement.’” He giggled sneakily like a little child. “I coined that, okay?”\nJohn broke into laughter, and he cursed and touched his chest. “I needed that.” He smiled. However, as Amanda’s friend and Michael’s voices continued behind him, his expression turned angry, tears dripping. He was quiet, suppressing all noise. “Amanda,” he mouthed. “I will become you if I have to.”\nMichael created a large portal that swallowed a chair and guffawed alongside Amanda’s friend named “Julie.”\nJohn wiped his tears and laughed. “No, no, no. That’s a big portal! You’ll swallow our entire house if you let that loose!”\nMichael covered his mouth elegantly the same way Julie did. “Really?”\nChapter 6 linkJulie split a bunch of bananas in half. He handed one half to John and Michael.\nJohn thanked her.\nHe sat on his haunches, hugged Michael, and showed him a steel sword. “This is a sword. Don’t worry. It’s sheathed.”\nMichael touched it and rubbed his cheek. His voice was squeaky. “Is this a—” He sneezed.\nJohn grimaced. “Oh, right, you’re allergic.”\nJohn stood up and rubbed his palm, gesturing toward the furnitures in the room. “Since we’re going to the War God Game, we’ll be fighting in against probably 97 other people.”\nHe, Michael, and Julie left, entered a field, passed a statue of a golden goose, and greeted a bunch of farmers. “Do you guys have the Remnants?”\n“Oh, sure, we do.” One of them raised their hands and opened their fists. Small ghost humanoids emerged and waved at John.\nJohn gave them an affirming smirk.\nThey left and walked up to Sick’s store.\nJohn greeted a hatted man sitting nearby. “Wouldn’t you have loved it if you had a child?” He imitated the man’s tone.\nThe man glared at him, but his glare disappeared to make way for a broken-toothed smile. He greeted John and shook his hand, joining him.\n“You… did the golden goose get you?” The man gestured toward the farmers with John.\nThe farmers gave a polite shrug. “We could’ve gotten it if we were there where it appeared.”\nThe man reciprocated their shrug.\nThey left and entered a tower where two boys holding ceremonial swords greeted John and bowed. “Our father is waiting upstairs.”\nThey climbed the tower, and John greeted Charter and Jacob. “Jacob, I trusted Charter with you and look where you are.”\nJacob’s work clothes were gorgeous and badass.\nA muffled boom sounded.\nJohn raised his brows, remembering Amanda.\nJacob gave him an awkward smile.\nJohn, Michael, Julie, the hatted man, and the farmers left and stopped in front of a group of dogs. A gate behind the dogs opened, and a woman whom John had met along with the mother of Adrian emerged. The woman tripped, and she gave a shy smile.\nShe looked nervous with the many people with John watching her.\nThe dogs’ expressions became nervous and licked John to appease him.\nJohn walked up to the woman and cast a calming spell.\nThe woman took a deep breath as if all her anxieties went away with her breath. She thanked John.\nJohn entered a small cave where an older man attacked a smithing anvil. John greeted him and bowed his head. “Sick is doing fine.”\nThe older man gave a tearful smile. “He is and has always been an overachiever.”\nThe older man joined John. “John, I want to know what you want.” He studied the other people with John. “And it seems, I’m not the only one.”\nJohn followed his eyes, paused walking, stared, and nodded with an appreciative smile.\nThey left and walked up to a set of gates. Their long circular rim at the top part of the gates carried hundreds of sleeping goblins. Each of them wore colorful, distinct clothes.\nJohn and his company entered as John revealed tons of ropes and red orbs.\nThey passed the statue that turned into a boy and entered a wall of darkness where a tall piston slammed them around into a vertical shaft.\nMany of them fell asleep from their wounds.\nJohn ran and grabbed a small toy in the middle of a glade, placing against Michael’s forehead. The toy turned into dust.\nA group of finches flew overhead, dropping logs.\nJohn gestured Michael to create portals to swallow the logs and pointed toward a cave.\nMichael’s portals swallowed the logs, but the finches brought more logs.\nThey entered a cave.\nThe older man smiled. “Hunger and Thirst for Righteousness.” He cast a spell that stopped their hunger and thirst temporarily.\nA bunch of warty pigs charged at them with bitter expressions.\n“Wait, why do we have to fight these things?” said one of the farmers with John. “I can easily soothe them with the Remnants.”\nJohn gave them an urging smile. “Sure!”\nThe farmers summoned spirits named “Remnants,” and the Remnants ran up to the pigs and calmed them one by one.\nThe pigs stopped and wandered away.\nAn army of undead dressed in butler and maid clothes and the voice of a lich emerged from the ceiling behind them. “Elevate.”\nThe undead scratched and bit the men, and the flesh where the undead hit gained the texture of red baskets.\nA group of three children with shiny skin whom John had met emerged from the undead and raised their hands toward John and those with him. They cast a spell.\nSweat emerged on John and his company’s foreheads, and their expressions became pale. Their stances became clumsy, as their eyes winced in pain.\nJohn stood on tiptoe and rubbed his eyes to get a better look, but they bled.\nHe fell to the ground. Bones that belonged to another creature emerged from his back and exited out of his skin.\nJohn and his company retreated, pulling one another away.\nCharter’s voice emerged and cast a spell. “Burn.”\nThe undead fell to the ground, their throats burning.\nJohn’s company of the farmers, the woman, the older man, the hatted man, and Michael escaped.\nThey looked at John’s desolate face and imitated his infectious frustration.\nJohn stared at a pool of water where they tilted their heads toward him.\nHe took a long, deep breath for over ten seconds.\n“Far south near the lake.” He struggled to speak.\nThey marched off.\nThey passed by a camp where several group of hooded travelers whom John had seen at the gates greeted them.\nJohn and his company greeted them back and traveled to a stopping point.\nJohn pointed at a small inn. “That’s my favorite inn. Step inside.”\nThey entered the inn and hid in a room to clean one another up. They drank the potions and healed themselves.\nThe farmers handed John a small cup, but John pushed the cup away..\nJohn flinched, but he forced a smile and accepted what he did. “I have cup bombs.”\nThe lights in the inn turned red as a group of adventurers sprinted through the hallway and barged inside John and his company’s room. “We heard bomb?”\nJohn clasped his forehead. “You didn’t see me?”\n“Oh, John, thanks man, you keep us entertained everytime.” They each gave John a four-step embrace: hand clasp, shoulder bump, back pat, release. “John, you are a king.”\nThe lights in the inn flashed a brighter red and fractured. The magic inside it dissipated.\nAnother group of adventurers emerged at the door, clasping one another’s shoulders. “Oh, John, thanks for coming! You guys really love beating the red light, don’t you?”\nJohn smiled at them and handed them a letter which Amanda had written with his words in mind. They mouthed and read the letter. They noticed damages on John and his company’s shoes and worked alongside one another to fix it.\nThey left, leaving behind him a small pouch of gold.\nJohn thanked them, tears dripping.\nThe farmers handed John a map.\nJohn pushed the map away and palmed his forehead.\nThe farmers had questioning looks, glancing at one another.\nJohn stuttered. “Sophia. The war.” He rubbed the sides of his head, sweat dripping down his chin.\nThe farmers nodded with accepting expressions.\nThey helped him lie down and fall asleep.\nThe farmers chuckled. “With the remnants, we stopped. We can just plant little plants here and there around our home, and any undead will die in an instant.”\nJohn gave a surprised chuckle. “Is that like murderous plants or something? How does that work?\nA crocodile greeted them. “Chase the way down to the refectory. You’ll find Sick there.”\nThey passed by a poster with the symbol on Jared’s armband.\nJohn’s expression became frightened for a split second.\nSophia whom John had met greeted them and led them to a table. “Please, write down your names. Chic hat, John.”\nJohn frowned. “I can’t write. Michael.” He turned his body and craned his neck around.\nMichael raised his hand and pressed through the crowd from the back. “Yes, Dad.”\nJared, thin and frail with eyebags, slouched on a chair and greeted Michael who sat beside him. He was reading a bunch of books and ripping apart the pages after he finished, tossing them in a bag. Sophia sat across him.\nJohn’s eyes widened. “Michael, you…” He touched his chest and calmed himself down. “Michael, make a portal around my neck.”\nJohn pretended he was dead, hoping to diffuse the tension.\nMichael created a portal, but John disappeared.\nMichael pulled John out and returned him to a chair.\nJohn’s shocked expression worried the people with him. He lowered his beret hat until it overshadowed his face, frowning.\nSick opened a door, emerged, and did a curtsy with a bloodied, bright-pink apron. “Where’s my money!” His voice sounded aggravated.\nJohn’s frown reached his neck, and he took out a large pouch of coins from a different country. “It’s delightful, Mr. Sick.”\nSick’s angry expression turned into a polite frown. “Delightful? The lich’s actions have made my life miserable. It’s sickening… especially with you putting off stopping your wife’s outbursts, right?” His expression turned bitter yet still polite.\nJohn compressed his lips and glanced at the hatted man with him.\nJohn smiled. “Did Jared eat a bunch of grapes and die? I heard he escaped.” He glanced toward Jared in the same room. He took out a sack of books and a sack with food bits and placed them on the table.\nJared glanced at the sacks.\nSophia rested her chin on the palm of her hand and played around with a used handkerchief. “The bandits didn’t know. He’s still inside. This is his prison. If their leaders need to lie to keep things in order, well… At least, I’m not a part of that stinky group.” She handed John a dessert plate with cheescake on it.\nJohn tasted it and glanced outside with longing eyes. His expression softened.\nA couple of ogres whom John had met cleaned a group of horses outside, waving at him.\nJohn palmed his face. He looked away and covered his face with both hands. He imagined Amanda’s face.\nAdrian danced and skipped around. “Michael, Michael, look at this.” He slashed at the air and swung his legs like a peacock. He slashed a—\nJohn rubbed around his open mouth. “Adrian, why are you here?”\nAdrian disappeared.\nJohn fell to the ground.\nMichael patted his leg and massaged it.\n“John, it’s me Amanda.”\nAmanda’s face replaced Michael’s despite Michael’s body still being there.\nJohn fell backwards. “Argh!” His scream was frantic.\nThe face of Olato whom John had seen with the goblins emerged from the ground. Everyone became Olato.\nEveryone panicked except for Imperial Secretary Sick, Chancellor Sophia, and former Grand Commandant Andrew ‘Jared’ Miller.\nSick forced a smile. “Stop this madness.” He stopped an illusion spell and the effects of the illusions on everyone. “The goblins? They’ve occupied Enterprise Town, but they seem to be closer than we think.”\nWhen the rest recovered, Sick, Sophia, and Jared had sat down.\nSophia sounded awkward but sincere. “Is everyone okay? I know everyone wants to run right now, but sit down even if it’s scary. Calm down. If they attack again, at least we’re in our chairs.”\nSick walked up to Jared and beat him up, throwing onto the wall. Jared healed himself. “Is that my father?” He sprinted up to the older man with John and greeted him.\nThe older man looked confused yet confident. “Sick? The Sick I know treated Andrew like a friend. Why did you do that?”\nSick pretended to think and stared outside for a while.\nSick’s voice sounded serious. “Andrew is a good man, but right now, he’s under me. It’s only correct that I follow the rules that I’ve set.” He stretched his arms outward as a gesture to hug.\nWhen Sick said “the rules,” the older man raised his brows. He accepted Sick’s gesture and hugged him.\nJohn made a grimace out of disgust, his face beside Michael’s. He was carrying and embracing Michael.\nMichael looked confused and glanced at John from time to time with a questioning look. His finger touched his mouth.\nMichael’s magic is toy monkeys.\n"

I was not able to face him, and he was not able to face me. Even if we longed for companionship, it was too late for us to be together. What we knew to be normal was long gone. Today marks a new day for both of us. Let us celebrate it together.”\nLater, Mark spat on the ground with a furrowed glare.\nHe lived in a mountainous land with paths that led down a vegetated slope, and his home lay in a village far from the various cities that crafted a sense of order in this world.\nEarlier, in the morning, Mark woke up, having seen things that he felt obligated not to see in his dreams. He chastised himself for “choosing his dreams,” having convinced himself that they were a product of decision rather than the subconscious mind. In the end, this was a feature of the culture that raised him.\nEveryday sounded like wet slops being chewed hastily and messily next to the ear. The beating noise perpetrated by the isolation his village cultivated made his day-to-day living hellish.\nIt could only be fixed with one solution—taking over this village and fixing things himself. He couldn’t bear to see his father be so irrational with his behavior, so he had to erect a world-renowned stronghold capable of dismantling the so-called virtues and values his father and his relatives and his lineage stood for to the point of stunting all growth. He had no time for games, so he had to prepare.\nIn the quiet noises buzzing and taking over the air, he continued silently in the dark, shutting himself away from the world his village had made. This time, he would seek out the broader land and the broader kingdom, that thematic term for the cities of the world, “Kingdom,” which his parents swayed him from. This way, he could get rid of this evil. He was repeating himself, but this emphasis transcended his psychological landscape.\nIt inhabited his actions with his sowing, with his trench digging, with his pit preparing, with his body looting on the periphery of a conflict, with his planting of suggestive evidences that contributed to his father’s descent to isolation. To explain all of this, if he could get his father raging on his side, then he could enact his next plan—division and control.\nOnce his father confessed his desire to leave the village, he looked around and made his way through and around the village, planning to meet his working father.\nBut his father had his head down, his body like a wet flag, his eyes like a sorry boy, his soul visibly displaced through the slumping body of his. Mark was enraged, but he held back his anger with rationality and control.\nNo more pain! No more suffering! No more endless torture!\nMark left the village, taking the big risk of his life. But it was rational! Oh, it was rational!\nHe ran through the forest, meeting monsters of various sizes. He made a deal. He didn’t even prepare for this, but he had to gamble.\nHe didn’t have to gamble, but this was his last resort. The monsters were not sentient nor were they even in psychological understanding with this deal. But he would bring them and bait them.\nOnce the monsters destroyed the villagers, he would win. No more pain! No more suffering!\nHe was a sociopathic murderer, and he would admit that. But at least, he didn’t live a life not worth living.\nWhen the monsters revealed themselves, his father was terrified, and with the drop of a hammer, Mark heard the familiar term, smirking.\n“Goblins!”\nThis was exactly the dream he foresaw.\nShifting focus elsewhere, after he saw how quick his father fell to the chops of a goblin horde, he knew the precision in which he would break open his emotional well needed to be consistent. In order words, he had to make sure the guilt didn’t breech his emotional gates.\nWith several grandiose gestures and devilish affirmations, he blasted away the guilt mites and crafted within himself a temple of violence.\n“I am the sin of man and the birth of a new age. Let me gamble with your lives together. These goblins will be your new fathers through freshly bathed blood. You are but children undergoing discipline. This is discipline. You must mature spiritually in the seconds before your deaths. Eventually, you will die, but pray that you will be saved prior to this…”\nHe stopped talking, not really taking what he said seriously because they were just fanciful projections of power. If he truly needed to gloat, he could sit down and feel arrogant all by himself. He was already in power anyway. All he needed was more.\nIt was not about power. It was about claiming what was rightfully his.\nAs soon as the goblins got bored and left, he came out of his hiding place, zeroing in on the various houses of the village.\nHe needed to store up his resources in order to move forward.\nHundreds of soldiers would be visiting soon, and he had to be prepared. Of course, they weren’t aware of the village massacre, but every so often, soldiers in twos visited. By the time six months had passed, hundreds of soldiers would have come.\nAfter directing his arms and legs forward, having dealt with the repercussions assigned to him by guilt, he grabbed loot from the crates, vaces, barrels, chests, and piles, making sure that anything of use was identified. Even if he didn’t get much, having gone through the effort of appraising a village boosted his skill in machinations later on.\nAfterwards, he discovered five sticks, several glowing orbs, and eight manuscripts that detailed common spells. As for the rest, he threw them into a single large container and made sure to toss it properly on the side. Violence required empathy toward neatness.\nWith these new items, he ventured toward the next village, following the smoothest path through which his father guided him during his early years. In response, he felt like vomiting, ounces of guilt bottling up toward the surface of his well. He had to cut down this guilt tree.\nHe made a swift, round motion, swinging his arms up and down. He physically attempted to expel the guilt demon inside of him because tears were already flowing down his face. The shock of having seen his whole village murderer in front of him had a subtle effect on him.\nHe couldn’t bear to see it again, which was why he had to distract himself.\nAfter successfully tossing the guilt to the side, he pressed forward, entering a new stage in his path. Now that the smoothest part of the path was over, he would be encountering various wild animals of various dispositions. He had to be alert and react appropriately, or else he might lose out on prey and hesitant too long near a predator.\nAs the seconds crawled forward, its limbs creating marks on the ground, he focused on the textures of the earth, following a line from the moss to the grasses to the trees to the canopy. He redid this repetitively, scanning the forest.\nEach second required a smooth orchestration of his limbs toward a crouching walk, paying mind to alternative postures and gaits if need be. It was excruciating to expect high, sustained attention toward his environment while keeping guilt at bay and his body agile.\nAt every stretch, he needed to find new blind spots and corner from which monsters could bounce. He smelled the air and kept his ears peeled, else he won in the who-dies-first game.\nHis hunger and thirst intensified enough, accentuating his foggy head. His feet and legs began to ache, his limbs having carefully balanced around the hand-carried items he had taken from the village.\nThis took hours, enough to break a man to dust.\nHe burst forward at the end of the day, finding himself in front of a village.\nThis was where he could escape.\nSo he did, blending with the villagers. His guilt dispersed in the meantime.\nNow, he was under a new sun that didn’t know what he did wrong.\nHe counted his targets.\nOne, a man named “Shallow” began opening a box, checking for what he needed for the day.\nTwo, a woman named “Redhurt” launched her fingers against a cookery pan, inserting them skillfully to ensure that the sharp edges of her blades kept succinct alignment with the meat she was cooking. It was a strange technique having basis in magic.\nThree, a child named “Soal” occupied his mind with his crush, seeing her everyday at the fence gates where the men worked.\nFour, a foot soldier named Reeda counted coins everyday, keeping his spear lying next to an old, broken wall.\nIn the beginning, Mark patiently worked as one of the villagers, observing his fellows and waiting hours upon hours for his time to shine.\nLater on, he readied his hands, rolling some cloth and wrapping it around his hands. A blade emerged from his pocket where it raised its tip in the event of a brutal cutdown.\nMark noticed that one of the villagers obtained information regarding the location of the soldiers, and he took advantage of the opportunity by befriending the the villager and offering his skills.\nAfter establishing some initial trust with a test, Mark located several distant outposts when the villager asked him to travel far out of the village to obtain a few flowers. It was another case of magic being the basis for what would have been an arbitrary mission if magic was absent.\nMark didn’t want to think too much, so with his spell manuscripts, he took one of them, saving the rest for later.\nFor context, before this, He put his items in a small container, and the villagers were kind enough to give him a place to stay and have privacy. So none of them had any qualms about his presence and his items.\nReturning to the present, if he consumed the spell manuscript he took after placing it in boiling water and letting the words and runes on it separate, he obtained a new ability—[Cold Gaze].\nSince the villager who had information and [Cold Gaze] were now among his cards, he looked for a new cards to play with to complete a set.\nIf that set turned to fruition, he would execute it immediately, breaking open the canister.\nChapter 2 - The Unraveling Alliance linkHowever, as Mark engaged in forethought, a stranger cocked her gaze at him, basically wearing the attire of a foot soldier but with much better equipment, wide-eyed like a predator.\nMark had a feeling that he would need to get the hell out of there fast.\nHe got up as one would do with a rabid dog and walked away, gradually increasing in speed so as to avoid provoking the dog more.\nThis had to be done carefully. He looked at various points in the village, so he had to make an efficient turn. He wasn’t looking behind him, but with enough time and focus, he could make a perfect beeline toward an escape zone where most of the villagers hung out.\nThe footsteps behind him made sounds. It was like horses.\nMark gritted his teeth and made even more awkward movements, sacrificing naturalness for speed.\nThe stranger behind him stopped, and Mark immediately shifted to a more natural gait, taking a deep breath and pretending that his limbs had been crying for a good stretch.\n“Mark…” said the stranger, a woman.\nNothing in Mark’s body language and face indicated surprise and fear.\n“Why do you have the title ‘Village Murderer’?” said the stranger.\nMark knew nothing about that. How did the stranger know?\nThe stranger knew Mark was powerless to stop her, so she confessed: “Follow me. I know things you don’t. I will help you achieve your goal.”\nMark’s ego could handle some help, but he was more concerned about his options currently. His options were not sure wins, and in the end, he had to choose between maybes. It was a matter of chance, and if the one he chose didn’t work, he could only curse himself out of frustration.\nIn the end, he chose the stranger’s command.\nFollowing her, he began to notice her beauty, but that was not important to his goal. So he ignored it.\nLater, Mark was still in shock.\n“I come from another world, and I was gifted with this thing called the [System]. And it shows me things I would never have known by myself. It’s actually crazy! Lol.”\n“???” Mark smiled with furrowed brows.\nInside him, he was hearing something his murderer ass couldn’t understand. After risking his life to take down a village, he now had to deal with a lunatic, possibly powerful beyond measure?\nHe laughed politely with the woman because she was the one to start laughing.\nHe didn’t even know why they were laughing. “Lol?”\n“Don’t mind it,” said the woman. “I’m Sophia.”\nMark squinted briefly and shook her hand, but the woman was offering a fist. “Are you angry at me?” It was a straight question, not something Mark would’ve done normally. He was usually the keep-it-all-in kind, but the woman’s personality was strangely disarming.\n“Who are you?” he continued.\n“Sophia Strong.”\nMark was asking a different question, but whatever. “Do you know why you intend to help me?” It was a weird way to phrase that question, but he didn’t know how to respond to her either. She was weird.\nSophia smiled and showed him her hands, telling him to give her his items.\nMark pressed his right brow, looking down. “You know?”\n“Yeah, I check every container. It’s a game mechanic!”\nMark began rubbing both brows, finding himself in a pickle. Yeah, she was a pickle, an ugly, maybe not so ugly, good-looking pickle that bothered him and made him feel awkward.\nHe sighed, but the fact that he was so openly annoyed in front of her meant something about the girl.\n“You.” Mark was tired of this charade. “Who are you?”\n“Sophia Strong—”\n“Where did you come from?” He noted the blade in Sophia’s sheath.\n“Town of God—the title. They called it ‘Marshishi-something’.”\n“‘Marshishi-shy’?”\n“Yeah.” Sophia began looking around, showing her back, grabbing things from her uncannily ornate bag.\nMark had no blade right now, but he wished that he could get it. If Sophia was too much of a risk, then he had to get rid of her. Even if she might help him, he couldn’t determine her intentions and motivations fully, making her a wild card.\nHe was supposed to be all-powerful, but Sophia was annoying and possibly capable of killing him on the spot.\n“Okay, now here you go.” She handed Mark a red potion. “For when you get hit by a monster and almost die—”\nMark burst into laughter before realizing that Sophia didn’t intend for her words to be taken as a joke.\nLater, Sophia led him to a cave near the village where they explored for exposed ores. After venturing deep inside the cave network, Mark was worried that she was going to use him as bait.\nBut Sophia was insistent on him using the potion she gave him.\nHe didn’t know how to repay her if she killed him this early. It was such a wonderful thing for his life to be treated like a ragdoll. How cool is that!\nSophia smiled the whole way, not paying Mark’s visible irritation any mind.\nShe was making him so obvious. Every expression he made was so revealing to her. It was as if she was controlling him to be honest.\n“Damn, he felt guilt about killing his father, okay?” he shouted, his voice ringing through the tunnel.\nIt was his voice that invited the monsters.\nMark frowned, staring at his hands and forearms, wondering when he became so weak.\nSophia began thrusting forward with a spear, using distance to keep her foes dissatisfied.\nThe monsters were 7 spiders, 3 zombies, and one skeleton archer.\nAfter Sophia cut them down to size, she used her arms and feet to beat them up like toys.\nMark’s frown grew deeper and deeper until he eventually looked away and pretended to cry.\nSophia snorted when he saw that, returning them to the surface.\n“What did we even do there?” Mark said, his expression full of regret after being honest earlier about his feelings. He didn’t want to be a psychopath after all.\nAfter rummaging through his items in his hidden container, Sophia gave him his blade. “Kill the villagers.”\nMark trembled for a moment before saying, “Are you crazy!”\nHer smile dropped.\nHe continued: “I thought I was not supposed to kill anyone! This is wrong! This is bad!”\n“I want you to kill people. Isn’t that what you did… before?” Her gaze was threatening, and her voice was cold.\n“No, no, not this…” Mark pressed his hands against his temples for a while, eventually groaning, smirking. “Let’s do it then!” Though, his worried brows said otherwise.\n“I made you my friend because I needed a tool.” She pointed at her and then at him. “You are my tool.”\n“Ugh…” Mark’s expression was distraught.\nShe was crazier than he was.\nHe followed her, and the villagers that were calm a moment ago began screaming in rage and epiphany.\nWhatever magic Sophia was doing to them, it was dangerous and broke their minds.\nMark grew sick, wanting to vomit, but he couldn’t after everything he did. He had to fulfill his goal and become powerful.\nWhile Sophia was looking at him, he demanded that she let him try and prove himself. He wanted to show her that he was the [Village Murderer].\nSoon enough, they both stood side by side, with her blade unsheathed and traveling over to Mark. This was their new alliance, a cursed dynamic.\nWhile Sophia wasn’t looking, he stabbed her in the temples with her blade and his.\n“You disgusting monster!”\nSophia’s body fell like a wet ragdoll. “Damn you!”\nHe breathed hard, wishing that he was lying when he said that he was the sin of man. “It would be so great to be a sin of man right now, whatever that means.” He huffed as he lay down.\nIn the meantime, the villagers fled, and this gave him an opportunity to flee with them.\nBut what he didn’t realize was that the villager elder was watching.\nLater, in a house far from the village, the villagers took refuge, arming themselves and stuffing their stomachs with energy food. If they had to fight, they needed to be prepared.\nThroughout all the fuss and grief expressed by the villagers, the village elder was leading their planning. Even after what Mark did, he still offerred himself as aid, saying that he used to be the son of his father, who was a solid adventurer back in the day.\nIn response, the elder was glad to employ his skills in strategy.\nTheir strategy would involve mobilizing more units from other villages, but they couldn’t do that without making a deal.\nWhat Mark didn’t realize was that his skill [Cold Gaze] was still off cooldown, which meant that he could still use it. He also realized that his muscles were now slightly more toned than before, and he remembered experiencing a sense of newness after he killed Sophia. He wondered if it had to do with his emotions or the [System] she was speaking of.\nIn the distance, Sophia still crawled like a frog breaking up floating petals, creating explosive craters with her legs. Her mana was releasing magic actively without her intention. It was because Mark damaged her head. Moreover, she was heavily wounded, leaving her little time to recover. If she didn’t give her potion to Mark, she would have been able to heal up.\nMark knew that Sophia was still out there, so with the permission of the elder, he gathered three men and scanned the burning village for Sophia.\nSince he was in a hurry, he didn’t confirm Sophia’s status and whether she was dead, wounded, or well. But the fact that Sophia didn’t follow them hinted at good possibilities.\nWhen he located Sophia, Mark and the three men held their offensive weapons: a scythe, a hunting knife, a hammer, and a butcher’s knife.\nSophia raised her hand, pedaling her legs until she got off the ground. But the ground met her face again. The strong feet of several men bursted her back and rolled her arms into soft putty. The excruciating blood loss left her unconscious.\nHer death signified a third stage of Mark’s life, making him smirk with delight. “You will not defeat me.”\n“Sorry what?” said one of the men.\n“Oh, uh, nevermind.” Mark still had that confessing habit that Sophia had spawned in him. It was disgusting to imagine her limbs entering his body and breaking down his emotional walls. That sounded horrid, considering how evil Sophia really was.\nMark expressed his discomfort with a stonefaced stare and moved on, reuniting with the villagers, ending the discussion about getting help and mobilization.\nChapter 3 - The Machinations of Mark: Division and Conquest linkThe next day, in Mark’s former village, a young goblin entered one of the houses.\nShe opened up a small cannister, discovering a hidden compartment inside.\nShe took it open and stomped it, breaking it and revealing a shining gauntlet.\nShe grabbed it and tucked it under her arm, viewing the wide assortment of new goblin villagers before her.\nThey were moving from their caves 6 kilometers away and exploiting this new location.\nThe assortment before her also went over to an arriving wagon and collected crates from it, unloading them into the houses. They would leave for now and venture into the nearby caves to wake up the goblins and other monsters hiding there.\nThe goblins left behind began to restructure the village.\nMeanwhile, a kilometer from Mark’s current village, monsters roamed, cutting trees down and putting them together into various wagons. They were delivering it to their bases.\nIn another scene, 25 kilometers away, tens of humans shot arrows at a small fort where tens of orcs threw rocks at a charging 6-man cavalry troop with prominently excellent armor. The cavalry slammed into the gate, but they bounced back with a roar of resistance from the gate. The projectiles rained on.\n5 kilometers closer to Mark, a 30-year-old man shot an arrow, opening a large exit hole in a beast, magic influencing his great strength. His bow was impossible to draw without the level of power his magically empowered muscles brought. He rained down several more arrows throughout the patient course of twenty minutes, interspaced with long hiking and traveling and repositioning. Monsters fell to the ground, and his stealthy attacks gained notice. He retreated when the monsters acquired full vision control of the area.\nReturning to Mark, from one of the villagers circulating the village, he got word of several goblins wandering around one of several spots that the adventurers spread traps around. The village was prepared, having dedicated much of their resources throughout the years into fortifications and palisades. Though, this much time spent into defences reduced their nutritious food and thus made them much more vulnerable to disease. As a result, several villagers had died since the village transitioned their focus to defences 3 months ago.\nNow, Mark was at the forefront of this mess, so he had to contribute by helping out with farming. If he didn’t manage skillfully enough, they were going to force him to leave or give up sleep just to do in 18 hours what could have been done in 6 hours by the average villager there.\nIn the end, he had to navigate through the challenges posed by his village amid the foundation of benefits it had offered him. He took this objective’s offer.\nA day after Sophia Strong’s death, Mark sat on his haunches under an open wooden shed, engaged in a challenging task. He was separating the skin from pigeon peas, using only his fingers.\nIn the meantime, a group of several juvenile villagers removed peanuts from shells one by one, being one of many tasks teams constituting the male work force.\nAs for the assertion that hunting and violence were embodiments of masculine work, hunting was only done during the dry season when the food source from agriculture was scarce. Moreover, they synchronized their hunting activities on plant phenology. Having observed that warty pigs fed on a specific plant during the mid-dry season, they targeted them when the plant species “Ulayan” and “Kalingag” actively flowered and fruited. In addition, hunting teams were only composed of two to three individuals accompanied by domesticated dogs. Overall, hunting varied within the year, done chiefly out of necessity rather than social traditions.\nUltimately, Mark’s previous violent actions were not pragmatic or philosophical. It was done for personal or emotional reasons.\nAfter Sophia’s death, Mark began to notice signs of life around him. Now that he saw that the fire was survived by a second-growth village area, he noticed the fresh and simple aroma filling his lungs. Furthermore, the late, richer and more complex scent of the village was survived by this new one.\nMark began to make his move, collecting baskets. Instead of distributing the resources he learned to get with the help of the villagers, he decided to look for goblins to lure. With the baskets full of pigeon peas, they would be convinced much easily.\nMeanwhile, several kilometers away, a goblin, slashing the earth, began releasing his frustration upon a stone, his arms tensing virtuously according to his God-given instincts. He was given freedom to create, and so he destroyed, shattering the constituents of matter. A rock stood in his way, and he crushed it with ease, letting his heart relish the moment of surprise. The dust-like remnants waited, and soon, the air lifted it up in swirls. The sun highlighted the goblin across the gaps in the trees.\nHe walked around, gazing for a human. He shivered when he saw a stick before sighing with relief.\nHe began running, traversing the forest grounds, his movements swallowing a dance-like pattern wherein swirling became succinct.\nHe danced upon the ground, the rocks full of arrogance but fallen against his illustrious stooping.\nHe reached a thicket of trees through which he viewed over a wide arc, spotting several distant figures that appeared trapped inside the holes between the leaves.\nHe readied his blade, infusing it with his spirit. The blade swung several times on its own, controlling the fine muscles within the goblin’s dominant arm. It continued swinging until the goblin was tired, but by that time, the spirit remembered the blade. And the goblin dashed out in a courageous charge, his form taking the secondary form of a bestial shadow whisking the distance off.\nHe slashed several figures to the ground, stomping them and clashing with their remaining strengths. They fell unabated.\nThe world crystalized in the palm of the goblin’s hand as fast as a sip, usurping the area’s power, but most of the power, which he couldn’t carry, zoomed off.\nThe goblin retained the power he received, equipping himself with new agency.\nThe next targets lay in the distance, but they were out of his sight.\nHe jogged, climbing each step of the way, trespassing amid the wards stationed to give his opponents vision of him, his form creating more speed and tenacity.\nHe zoomed with a heroic sprint, grabbing and taking what he needed from the branches. launching himself further beyond.\nHe stopped, his essence relaxing, his weapon becoming primed with spirit.\nHe disappeared, blending into the trees.\nReturning to Mark, his expression was frail because he knew that the longer he stayed in the village, the nearer he was to becoming its captive.\nHe was growing exhausted.\nHe gritted his teeth. All he had to do with his past village was invite the goblins at the best time, but he had spent his whole life in that village, knowing the ins and outs, knowing the people, knowing his father, knowing the goblins. Yet, now, he was in a place where he couldn’t just use the same formula-solution. He was angry, but he knew that it made logical sense that this new village would present a hurdle.\nHe should have known! He should have known! Now, he was getting the whipping of a lifetime!\nAnd the thing was that he knew all along! It was this stupid ass world that kept on giving and giving.\nHe had to find a way to control the village and fast. He was making progress, and sure, it was excellent by the standards his former village had applied to visitors. But he was starting to get impatient.\nIf he waited too long, he would spend two years being a loser-dooby-douser again! He was not going to do that anymore!\nHe prayed that his current village just burned to hell. He had to ruin his former village. He had to. If he hadn’t done it, he would have gotten stuck. This village was the same. If this village didn’t give him power beyond what he envisioned of a village, he would destroy it all. He couldn’t sit down here and wait for things to change on their own. He had to do something!\nBut he couldn’t just lure the goblins again without control of the village and its surroundings.\nHe needed all the help he could get. He had to destroy complacency and weakness and helplessness. He was tired of seeing his father suffer and be sad all the time. He had to remove his sadness. He had to do it! He couldn’t bear to see him cry and insidiously ruin himself and the lives of those around him. He couldn’t bear to see the children so weak and frail. He had to break this cycle of pain, so he had killed them all in one fell swoop. This was the war to end all wars. They were going to Heaven anyway. He would take responsibility for this because he was tired of being helpless all the time. He didn’t want to see someone suffer and do nothing. He had to do something, and if he couldn’t help someone suffering for too long, he might just kill them due to how helpless they made him feel. He would kill a human being if it meant they didn’t hurt anyone anymore and hurt themselves in the process. Instead of killing someone throughout the course of their entire life, it was better to confront them. But if that didn’t work after many years and the issues were worsening and still being ignored and not addressed, he had to destroy this suffering by getting rid of it all. He couldn’t bear to see the children suffer under a banal system of ruination.\nThe system didn’t address his concerns over people who were suffering that he decided to destroy the system in one fell swoop, freeing them all from this insidious massacre by releasing their souls into Paradise.\nHe couldn’t live his entire life pretending any more. In the end, he spent years watching the children suffer under neglect and abuse. He had to do something. He couldn’t let someone go through what he did. Just because his father was suffering didn’t give him the right to worsen the lives of others. He had to stop it all. The children could never find peace in this world after what they had gone through—they didn’t deserve this!—so he decided that it was better for them to live outside of their bodies and trauma. They were free now.\nShifting away from Mark toward a more objective, omniscient perspective, he was abused and neglected growing up in a remote village and had no access to education and alternative knowledge systems, so his framework of mind was likely a manifestation of that.\nHonestly, the lesson to be learned was that well-rounded education and open-mindedness went a long way to preventing something like this.\nObjective thoughts aside, Mark was already making his way up the mountain next to the village. Most villages were situated a distance from a mountain range.\nHe came upon a hamlet and began talking to the people there. However, he couldn’t understand them, so he returned again to the village and asked about it.\n“Those people are not with us…” said one of the villagers ominously. “Those are the Mongyon. They don’t belong here.”\n“Here?” Mark was merely pretending to be confused because he knew all along that the hamlet was an indigenous community, having seen his former village killing them. But he didn’t understand why they did this.\n“Have you seen their appearances?” said another villager. “They’re goblins!”\n“What…?” Even Mark wasn’t this dumb to say that humans were goblins. There was a very clear difference between goblins and humans, so the notion that the people from the hamlet were goblins was clearly racist scapegoat tactics. He might be a sociopathic murderer, but he wasn’t discriminatory.\nBut seriously what the hell was wrong with these people? At this point, he just wanted to destroy this stupid village right now. He was one of them for now, but what was the point? It was annoying having to deal with their political shit. Nothing about this was fucking pleasant.\n“Can I just say that the people from the hamlet don’t look like goblins to me?”\n“They are!” continued the villager. “Have you seen their faces?”\n“What…?” Mark was reaching his limit. He might just execute this person right here, but he already had a plan in his mind.\nWith the baskets he had hidden, he lured tens of goblins into the village without making it inconspicuous.\nAs a result, the village spent all day fighting, leading to significantly weakened tempo and strength.\nNow, Mark visited the hamlet, saying that he was finally leaving. The village couldn’t stop him.\nWhen he came there, he said that the village was attacked and the villagers were pinning the blame on them. He warned that foot soldiers would be coming.\nThe hamlet didn’t believe him at first, but Mark showed him the coat that the village women gifted him. It was clean, so Mark dipped these clothes in goblin’s blood and presented it as evidence of a goblin attack.\nMark added that it was advisable to attack the village now because they were still recovering for several days.\nA deep sigh followed by a weary “It is what it is,” embodied the hamlet’s reaction.\nThe hamlet began walking to the village.\nMark tiptoed forward, reinforcing his message with details, his flavorous tones crafting the perfect guise of hurry.\nAs soon as the hamlet arrived, the hamlet leader offered to talk. But one of the villagers saw Mark collapse.\nSeeing him groaning in pain, the hamlet decided to leave Mark with the village, expressing sorry because of the awry state of the village and returning to the hamlet. They would rather not hurt anyone, being peace-loving.\nAs soon as Mark stopped pretending, he said that earlier, he asked the hamlet for help, but they poisoned him and forced him to come help attack the weakened village. He added that as soon as the hamlet saw the village, they likely decided to wait for more goblins to stockpile weapons before they joined the next attack. He even alleged that the goblins and the “goblin” humans assaulted and murdered a village woman in his former village.\nSeveral days later, the villager men approached the hamlet, attacking it, waging war, racking up the deaths of each individual in that hamlet, killing every single Mongyon there.\nEven if Mark failed, he succeeded in dividing and conquering them as one of the villagers.\nSoon, after Mark was gone, the actual goblins would return, destroying the battle-exhausted villagers.\nChapter 4 - Unraveling the Threads of Fate linkEarlier, Mark learned that Sophia’s death gave him access to a holographic view of the [System] that showed him his levels, stats, skills, and so forth. It had belonged to Sophia, but now it was his.\n[Level up! You have gained a new skill—“Redburst”]\n[Redburst (INNATE): Any enemy within 1 meter becomes marked with a red mark. If you or your allies basic attacks a marked enemy, they deal an extra 10 damage.]\n[Level 2: Mark Reader\nHealth: 610/610\nMana: 311/311\nArmor: 47\nMagic Resistance: 32\nSkills: Redburst; Cold Gaze]\n[Cold Gaze (ACTIVE): Any enemy your eyes meet becomes affected with Cold. Cold reduces damage dealt, attack speed, and movement speed by 15%.]\nOne morning, Mark travelled to the nearest town with the help of a foot soldier named “Reeda”.\nThe village was now set as a checkpoint and a second base with the town potentially being his primary base of operations. He still didn’t know that it would be occupied by goblins by the time he returned.\nWhen he reached the town, he discovered that goblin villagers were placed inside a small prison-like community within the borders of the town. They were being made to work and supply specialty goods as exchange for protection, security, and opportunity. Giant walls kept the goblins inside, and this made sure that the goblins were being exploited to maximum efficiency. Many of them worked in quarries and mines.\nThis was considered the natural progression of goblin subjugation, since goblins couldn’t just be wiped out without significant losses on both sides. It was easier to trap and convince them to surrender in order to process them efficiently and systematically.\nThe goblins’ professions included the armorer, butcher, cartographer, cleric, fisherman, fletcher, leatherworker, librarian, mason, nitwit (a villager without a profession), shepherd, toolsmith, and weaponsmith. Some goblins were even trapped in tiny, tight booths to keep them from wandering.\nThough, at one point, the land where the town was built decades ago belonged to the goblins.\nAnyway, if Mark was careful, he could abuse this situation.\nAs soon as he reached the adventurer guild, he learned that the adventurers made up a significant portion of the public enforcement. However, policing activities varied within the year, resting upon necessity. Ultimately, he began assessing how the adventurers pathed around the town.\nHe learned a breadth of things.\nFor example, with domesticated goblins, the adventurers were able to bring the utility to the front line of monster hunting and dungeon station checkpointing (the installment of forward operating bases in the context of adventuring).\nReeda, his companion, left Mark as soon as he arrived at the village, trusting him to navigate his own challenges and the town for himself.\nFortunately, Mark found an inn willing to accept him for work; however, he realized that none of the ten positions offered suited him. He left looking for another place. Wandering long and hard, he encountered a man who told him he was looking for someone who could read and write. Mark Reader, being surnamed such much later after birth due to his uncommon ability to read and write, was offerred 8 positions: scribe/record keeper, translator, message courier, map reader/navigator, researcher/librarian assistant, inventory manager, apprentice mage/scholar, chronicler/storyteller.\nHe later discovered that the recruiter was part of an adventurer faction.\nThe faction reverbrated across multiple divisions occupied by squads of individuals.\nThis was the time to commence the workload.\nMark climbed slowly, joining the faction and starting from the bottom of this high ladder.\nThe faction itself was a behemoth as visible from the various buildings that made up its influence.\nThe divisions were multiple giants, guiding the groups toward their aims.\nThe specialists broke ground in new ways, tearing through classifications and having groups circle around their unique potentials.\nThe squads separated across the expanse, sounding echoes into the nooks and crannies where goblins hid cowardly.\nMark stood before this sky.\nAt the training grounds, he was expected to learn his swings in order to develop camaraderie with his fellows, but for the most part, he did work as an inventory manager, spending most of my time watching the various training equipment and how they were used. In the end, he would see the various skills that adventurers exployed.\nOne time, a woman danced, sundering the earth, creating swathes of balls of colorful light, their beauty spreading across the scenery. Her eyes became disfigured like boiling flesh, her arms continuing to wrap around itself in never-ending bends and folds. She transformed into a floating bird with several arm-like appendances sprouting from her back, her form levitating above the ground, her buttocks separating into various compartments.\nFurthermore, she summoned herself forward, casting a spell that wrapped around several dogs into a package, casting another spell that shooed several blades flying around her, casting a third spell that broke the earth and coated it with a black tearing acid.\nFinaly, she emerged like a little pod, crafitng several different motionary steps toward oblivion. Her form hid among thousands of lights, she gloated, her soul tearing through them and bursting out of death.\nMark stared.\n“Hey,” he said.\nThe woman furrowed her brows in response.\n“Uh. I was wondering if you can tell me how you did that?”\nThe woman was glaring.\n“If you don’t want to, it’s fine.”\nAfter leaving, Mark entered another room.\nIt led outside where various villagers had gathered under the shade in front of a large gate.\nThey were resting, wiping their sweat with cloth, relaxing, and drinking water.\nOn the ground, next to the villagers, yokes attached to baskets rested.\nMark stared and began to recognize that this situation was familiar. He remembered what it was like to see hundreds of villagers in one place. He saw it many times during his village’s interaction with other villages during feasts.\nThe ceiling was too high, and maybe, the ceiling was the friends he made along the way.\nHe fell to the earth, remembering the bodies of his friends when he passed them after he lured the goblins to massacre them all.\nThey were not his friends anymore. They had gone without him, and he had been left behind here on this dying world. They were free now.\nHe smirked, his lips trembling, his eyes flickering between grief and a smug expression. Under his eye, a twitch of frustration reared its head.\nHe was not to be limited. He was not bound by this stupidity!\nHe saw the woman again. This time, behind his polite eyes, he wanted to exploit her being, which meant empathizing with her and being sensitive to her humanity. This way, he would harness her power optimally. But with his empathy came a harrowing sensation of guilt. Though faint, it came alive like a thousand stars at midnight.\nHe walked up to her and greeted her politely with his head bowed momentarily. This served as a buffer for his next attack—he asked if she could tell him where the latrines were. When she helped him with this, he left for a moment before returning to say that he realized that his body didn’t need to go after all. So in the meantime, pretending to have stuck himself in an awkward situation and be looking for a way to escape it, he asked her how she was doing, adding, “It’s nice, no?” It was intentionally vague enough for her to fill in the blanks.\n“Yeah, it was a good thing they finally got the goblin system functioning,” said the woman.\n“I was surprised that it happened so fast.”\n“I mean, I guess 50 years is quite fast.”\n‘I’m talking about how it was placed.\"\n“Uh, yeah, I guess they did have the whole town around it pretty quickly.”\n“I was wondering how long it would take though before it actually started working, you know?”\n“Yeah, I’m guessing they’re still testing to see if it can really help the goblins work faster.”\n“Uh-huh. But I meant that the people responsible were not really that.”\nHis question made it seem as if she was the one being awkward and misunderstanding. So she felt the need to compensate. “You’re right. Jay and Lumi have been really adamant against unpermitted constructions, so it’s honestly problematic with how much adventurers have to build around.”\n“Basically,” Mark said. “Something like that.” He was rewarding her engagement with post-disagreement post-disapproval agreement and approval, laying the groundwork for him being a source of confidence to her.\nNext, he pretended as if he was interested in having a regular talking with her because of her and as if they had much more to discuss and do together.\nHowever, seeing that the woman was starting to feel too comfortable, he left, making her tense up and wonder if she did anything wrong. She also wondered who Mark was with the confident and self-willed way he left. It was unusual to see someone so leader-like, as if he was secretly the boss that controlled the area and didn’t know how to feel fear, nervousness, and anxiety.\nHer second-guessing and curiosity were groundwork for a potential informant, one that overshared and overexplained to hedge against every possible misunderstanding and root of offense.\nIf someone was so confident, respectful, and sociable with her, then she didn’t want to say anything wrong.\nMark took a deep breath, and then he raised his delicate fingers, letting them dance around in a twirl. “Maybe I should be careful…”\nHis face became pinched with a smile.\nIt was a complexity, but who was he to stop now?\nIt was the destiny had been given—to destroy the ruination of this world.\nHe would do with his own hands instead of waiting for help as he did all those years. No one came to save him! No one did!\nHe grinned, assured that he would save someone this time. Indeed, he would save himself through them.\nAs for how he would do that, he needed to become the epitome of grace and beauty.\nMark viewed the [System].\n[You may pick up leaves on the ground to improve your affinity with nature. Identify a leaf!]\nMark picked up two leaves and focused his vision on it until everything else blurred into the background.\n[Leaf +2]\n[Affinity with nature: 100/0.00000000000000000001]\n[Witchman 💀💀💀 sent you a friend request.]\nMark was already inexperienced with the [System], so something like this was outside his expectations. Who sent this? What were their intentions? He wanted to know quickly.\nHe tried to get the [System] to answer him about what this friend request was.\nThe [System] immediately magically made him understand that he could send messages to others through it. However, the default settings made it so that two individuals needed to have each other as [Friend] first before the could send each other messages.\nHe decided to try turning off this setting. When he did, hundreds of messages immediately began pouring.\nThese messages were not private messages, but they were public ones sent throughout the entire world.\nHe looked for another setting that blocked public messages.\nNow that he was calm, he wondered if the public messages offered free knowledge and information that he could use. So he asked the [System] how he could go through the public messages easily without getting bombarded with notifications and messages.\nThe [System] informed him that he could go to the [Forums] where messages were separated by categories and threads.\nWhen he went here, the [Forums] showed up as a large rectangle that he could scroll through. He found several words that caught his attention. “Found diamond at 65 y.”\n“Survive the disasters ist still the best spell.”\nHundreds of vague titles like these broke his curiosity and made him close it to relax. The stimulation was getting to him. How did people cope with this [System]? And who got access to view the [System] and who didn’t? For most of his life, he knew about the [System], but he never knew about that it was possible for some to see it. The fact that he got access to [Forums] and private messages just because he could now view the [System] and interact with it better instead of using it only for skills made him a little nervous.\nThis great power he now held daunted him.\nAfter accepting Matthew Cruz’s friend request, the first message he received was friendly.\n[Witchman 💀💀💀: Hello, I forgot that I shouldn’t be contacting newbies. But welcome to the world. I’m also from Earth. I notice you’ve been ignoring my friend requests for a while now, so I’ve been spamming you the whole time. Plus, I notice your name’s changed? How did you do that? Weren’t you Sophia Strong before?]**\n[Mark Reader: Oh nice!]\nHe didn’t know what to say because he didn’t know how things worked in private messages, so he just threw out something vague. Of course, staying vague for too long could be troublesome, so he had to add more to his current response later.\nBut now was not the time.\nChapter 5 - The Web of Opportunity linkMark already knew what to do, as he had a lot on his plate. But it was sufficient for him.\nHe began searching through the [Forums], finding locations of various dungeons and treasure. He also found the locations of cities of which he had never heard before. This continued on and on until he compiled a list, but he couldn’t write it down because he was poor.\nSo he used his first pay to buy a pen and paper. The pen used minimal mana to create ink, and it allowed him to write for days. Though, he did wonder what he could do with ink. If he poured magically created floods of ink into a forest, what would happen?\nHe wrote the list of locations, finally accomplishing his goal.\nBut he wanted to see how well the people knew about these places, so he decided to kick up conversations with customer-facing employees, asking questions about the locations. However, he was immediately dismissed and directed toward an information shop. He was stumped that information ahd to be bought around here. His father would often tell him stories about dragons, monsters, and terrifying cities where bandits created factions and tortured peasants with summoning magic. But he was not here, so he had to rely on whoever was available. It wasn’t as if his father knew everything. He had been stuck in that village for who knew how long. And based on the way he told those stories, they were probably all hearsay. In the end, he was glad that he had to pay for information because it made him extra sure that it was genuine. But who could say still?\nHis thoughts about Witchman remained pending, as he still had no clue what to do about the [System] really. He was still pondering how he could distribute his stats effectively after learning about them from the [System]. In the end, anything that had to do with holographic text was on hold until further notice, except for the [Forums] of course.\nHe tried to look for locations that he knew, but he found none. In fact, mentally typing place names he knew into the search bar yielded absolutely nothing. He was mortified about the idea that this world might be bigger than he thought, and his small world in the village and around was very small.\nThe only thing he could do was move forward until he found exactly what this world was keeping from him.\nHe sighted several adventurers standing around on the side of the street and approached them, asking if they knew about the locations he found on the [Forums]. None of them had anything to say, so he really gave up and went to the information shop a few meters away.\nAt the information shop, he greeted the shopkeeper, a man wearing several glasses all on top of each other. He had six eyes, but the two pairs of glasses and eyes above the respective firsts were illusory and transparent. So a few seconds after his greeting, these extra pairs of glasses and eyes disappeared.\nMark offered a piece of paper on which his list of locations were written. As soon as the shopkeeper stopped to pick it up and placed it on the counter at the opening of the fence protecting him, he smiled. “I have no idea what these are,” he said.\nHis smile looked insincere and ambiguous, but Mark gave up immediately and left. He didn’t want to piss off someone who probably knew people that he didn’t want to meet on a bad day.\nSince this ended in failure, he adjusted to his next plan—he reunited with Reeda, asking him about the village. Reeda told him that the village was destroyed, and he only learned about it recently from his fellow foot soldiers.\nMark didn’t like the sound of the people he had spent so much time cultivating a relationship with killed. He spent so much time and effort grinding to cultivate that, and he didn’t want to deal with setbacks this early in his journey.\nReeda frowned when he saw Mark’s frustration, thinking it hinted at grief. “I also didn’t know… I’m sorry…”\nMark was also happy to know that he could easily destroy villages with the right timing. He had intended to kill the villagers anyway, but he didn’t have to this time. He just wanted to cut down their numbers to ensure that he maintained control of the situation. It was like bullying others just to remove the worry that they could be a threat. If they were, then the bullying would stop. He didn’t want to have a bunch of people just within range doing whatever they wanted outside of his knowledge. He could predict people for so long before one of the people at the hamlet suddenly decided to lure goblins like he did. He didn’t trust people because he knew how easy it was to hurt people.\nIn the end, he told Reeda that he wanted to find books to read.\nReeda responded by saying that they both didn’t have enough money, and it was very expensive. But Mark said that he would soon have enough money.\nMark allowed Reeda to glimpse into his short-term objectives of intelligence gathering, but he only did this because he was planning to pull Reeda into the role of an informant.\nIf Reeda saw Mark struggling, as a foot soldier, he could provide clues as to what was going on.\nHaving a committed relationship with others was part of Mark’s goals, but he was only there for their benefits. As soon as it became too rocky to manage, he would duck out.\nAfter stringing Reeda along to get him some food for both of them, Mark found out that Reeda had a family here, so he asked if he could visit one day to give gifts. And Reeda, recognizing Mark was probably scared and grieving after what happened to the village, said that he could go. Though, he did add that Mark had to make sure that he was holy because being holy prevented sicknesses.\nMark, having ties with the [System], knew he was referring to the [Holy] buff that was also a debuff if the person who had it was undead or deemed evil.\nReeda was especially careful about diseases because it was expensive to request for a cure. Requesting healing at the temple involved buying animals. If a priest confirmed that the animals were holy, he would allow them to be used for sacrifice. If the sacrifice went smoothly, then a single use of healing was provided.\nSince Mark was worried that he would be outed as evil and possibly killed, he said nevermind with regard to the family visit. His goal was to create footing in this town by having family friends that could make his presence here normal. The more normal he was, the easier it was for him to integrate into the broader community. Moreover, having friends was beneficial for his spirit and mind, even if he did intend to break off with them if necessary.\nSince he was not one to think about things so much, he went to various establishments in order to look for the one most attuned to stranger conversation. He found that the adventurer guild was pretty slow-paced, but the groups of people were discussing at length, notably standing up. So he approached one of them.\nAs soon as he edged close, one of the adventurers sighted him, met him halfway, and offered to shake his hand, saying, “We’re taking rabbits, want to come…?”\nMark declined, heading to another establishment—an inn where people were seated and more rowdy. He approached a 1-person table and asked if he could chat with them.\nThe person declined and pointed outside with an annoyed look.\nMark approached another 1-person table and succeeded.\nWhen he sat down, the person across from him offered to buy him a drink, but Mark declined.\nAfter that, Mark said, “I’ve always been surprised by the way the people here have been handling things lately.”\nThe person smiled, squinting, before bursting into laughter. “Yeah, I had nothing the other day, but now I’m here.”\nAfter a few seconds, the door of the inn opened, squeaking loudly, as people entered and left.\n“Oh, shoot, someone’s calling to me,” Mark said, standing up.\nWhen he left the inn, he pretended to look around for a while before returning inside, sitting back down with the same person.\nThe person, with a look of clarity, said, “Who was that?”\nMark smiled politely. “It was a friend, but I didn’t see them. Maybe, I was wrong about having seen them call me. Anyway, I was wondering about the events lately. It’s crazy, right?”\n“Yeah, yeah, the goblin system was the first time I’ve seen anything move that fast.”\nMark nodded slowly before smiling in a way that very subtly expressed that it wasn’t what he meant.\nWith a slightly surprised expression, the person switched topic. “Yeah, after the queen in Azkaelstra, I didn’t have time to finish up the cards. It would’ve been great if I won a bet this early in the year.”\nMark repeated his slow nod and particular smile to make sure that it looked more like a mannerism in case the person started nearing the point of suspicion where he realized Mark’s more subtle style of communication. Most people had those very slight doubts at the bottom, which was a level strong enough to shift behavior but weak enough to be actual suspicion. Now that he had fooled the person into believing that his slow nod and particular smile was manneristic, he succeeded.\n“The queen?” Mark asked, finally finding a potential well of information.\nAfter the conversation, he came to understand that the queen was planning on creating a variety of goblin systems for the sake of generating goblin power.\nWhat he didn’t know what this was often compared to the use of sunlight as clean energy to power golems magically instead of embedding them with magical ores. Moreover, the new trend saw enchanced goblins being used to free humans from tasks that were dangerous, monotonous, or physically demanding.\nNot bothering too much with it, he decided to go check out one of these goblin systems.\nEven if he was aware of the [Forums], he preferred allocating his precious time toward tried-and-true methods of investigation—that of firsthand experience.\nSo at the site of a goblin system, it looked like a giant contraption with many different magical machines in lines and zigzags, all leading to a large pot.\nHe didn’t want to bother too much about it, so he focused his energy on exploring the land, heading to an adventurer guild.\nHere, he was able to verify his assumptions of adventurers. They were often very rowdy and rough-mouthed with their vulgar wording.\nHe didn’t want to spent too much time with such problematic people since his late father used to be one of them and Sophia Strong probably as well.\nExiting the guild, he was quick to furrow his brows at the sight of a different kind of community, that of crafting.\nHundreds of dwarves—each accompanied by 10 to 30 adventurers making up a party with a few larger party exceptions with more than one dwarf—exited the guild building. They were an immigrated minority population inherited for the sake of exploiting their particular skills, but Mark didn’t understand this.\nBecause they looked more reasonable and proper-placed than the adventurers, he approached them.\nHowever, he was immediately motioned away by a foot soldier, and it was Reeda. Nearby, different teams of workers travelled along, not paying the dwarves too much mind.\n“You cannot do this…” Reeda said, referring to the dwarves. “These… dwarves… are a specialized community actively working with the adventurers, really special. I know this is your first time, but look, assassin mages are watching.” Furthermore, an assassin mage was commonly known as “coloraz”—or “colorazs” when plural—but he used a synonym to respect Mark’s lack of world experience.\nUnknowningly, Mark was taking hits from various areas, but how could he know? He was still a little babe about to take flight. Where was the eagle mother? She was pushing him off the cliff.\nReturning to his awaited response, he was interrupted by the sight of a goblin that got stuck in a lying barrel, running from adventurers. He was being beaten from the bottom side of the barrel.\nMark ran to him and pulled its arms with all his might, its screams getting increasingly desperate. He could hear the heavy blows of the adventurers on the other side of the barrel. When he finally pulled the goblin through, it died. Its spine had been shattered.\nFrom an objective viewpoint, Mark stood still for around 30 minutes, changing his posture every half a minute, his hands stretching around for much of the time. Furthermore, he turned around to scan the area every five minutes. Eventually, his eyes met the viewpoint.\nHis face twitched, dead-still everywhere else.\nHe suddenly smiled, shaking a little.\nMark left and returned his attention to progress.\nIn the city, he sighted various services offered by mages throughout the town. He saw a service for the “perfect haircut”, another service for the “best wooden shoes”, another service for the “most robust goblin thralls.”\nHe went to a shoe store and asked how much one was.\nIt was 2 gold coins.\nSo he looked for a simple job, realizing that he would not be able to succeed in this town by being a hateful person. He had to build connections.\nHe found a small stall where a young man was selling. He had a long list of customers, selling shampoo.\nMark didn’t know what it was, so he came to look. As soon as the young man saw him, he widened his eyes briefly before returning to normal with a smile as if nothing happened.\nMark was curious, so he waited for them to finish, beginning to feel his stomach grumbling. With Reeda’s help, he ate outside his house for a while before returning to the stall.\nThere, he saw the young man putting various crates, chairs, and tent poles, among other things, into several wagons. He was alone, but he was doing all this hard work.\nWhat Mark noticed was that the young man was carrying many things at once.\nMark didn’t think much of it at first, but when he saw the young man carrying things that couldn’t be carried with one hand alone, his eyes became wide open, and his mouth turned agape.\nThe young man was no ordinary man. He had Mark’s curiosity at first, but now he had his attention.\nIf he could get into his man’s good graces, he would be working with a powerful creature.\nEven if he was exaggerating, he wanted to take the first opportunity at this point, or else he would starve to death.\nChapter 6 - Embracing Change: A Journey of Redemption and Discovery linkThe dripping rain waged a war with the heathen dirt, making mud civilizations under the ominous, staring sky.\nHere, within this pin of a world, Mark carried several boxes, following the pouring rain and the man named “Richard” who sold shampoos at a stall.\nMark saw the customers coming close and away, into attention and out of it, and far off into the horizon where he could no longer see them.\nHe wondered what happened to people beyond what he could see.\nThis was the thoughts that spawned from his boredom, as he was busy helping out with carrying the things and helping explain to passersby why shampoo could save their life and health.\nHe didn’t know what it meant to be like this, but he wondered if he could go visit an adventurer guild now.\nAfter work, it marked his seventh day of work, having spent that time earning enough money to get a pace going enough that he could stay at an inn. He didn’t have a cottage or somewhere quiet he could hide, since he had to be there at the stall at all times, starting from the early morning to late at night. He didn’t know what he was doing beyond the physical, concrete, and first-hand level, but it was his focus right now.\nSince he only got meager pay, he was asked by the young man whether he knew how to sauté jalapeños.\nMark was unaware of the terms “sauté” and “jalapeños,” but he tried to do it anyway. With the help of Richard, he was able to get it down to memory.\n“Richard?” he said, unable to comprehend a few things about Richard.\n“Yes?” said Richard, turning around to face Mark.\n“Why did you help me?” Mark began to cook a dish called “sisig,” pouring oil first and then putting the ingredients into a pan.\n“Because… everyone deserves a second chance,” Richard said, as he accepted papers of recommendation from a group of colorfully dressed travelers.\nIn response to Richard, Mark rubbed his temples, feeling the same confusion he felt in Sophia Strong’s presence. People were overwhelmingly unique and hard to interpret, predict, and understand.\n“Why?” he said.\nRichard smiled and gave a thumbs-up to a farmer father and his child. “It’s also that feeling you get when you see a child.”\n“What feeling?” Mark said, rubbing his nose due to the numbness and tingling from his lack of sleep. The smell of the jalapeños he was cooking were also slightly strong.\nRichard continued to sell shampoo, putting together various ingredients and combining them with a skill. “Your heart opens up, and you feel an overwhelming need, possibly even frustration, to appreciate life through them. You’ll want to appreciate beauty and wonder, and it’s not because they’re children or they’re them necessarily. Everyone is unique, but beauty is everywhere in abundance. You’ll feel that feeling, something that you can only feel if you’ve lived a big life.”\nMark stared at him. “A big life?”\nRichard hurled a shampoo bottle accurately at the farmer father, who caught it with ease, both of them laughing at a joke he made in passing. He had been in a another conversation alongside the one he was having with Mark. “A big life, one that you feel afraid of forgetting due to its great abundance.”\nMark kept tossing and turning the sisig pork. “Abundance? Of memories? Of events?”\nRichard gave a thank-you, a thumbs-up, and a smile to a leaving regular customer. “Yes, but more than that, perspectives, feelings, and people. Images, flavors, smells, senses, long conversations, that idea that you had in your head and how you saw it throughout time. It’s that and so much more.”\nMark placed a plate of food to a group of cheery, loud, boisterous adventurers seated at an eight-top table separate from the three tables enclosing him and Richard right now in a square. “Really?”\nRichard searched Mark’s expression for a moment before he smiled softly. “Yes.”\nMark slowed down his pace at the stall as the customers lessened in the afternoon.\nDuring this time, he long realized that the streets belonged to everyone, being a community gathering, being a faster pace of life compared to his former village. It was much more exciting and full of so much opportunities for connection and larger goals.\nMark couldn’t feel anything. He felt numb, yet he was relaxed and immersed in his surroundings.\nAs a manifestation of fluid intelligence, He knew well that the only reason things were along well was because of the provisions of magic. If it wasn’t for that, everything would have fallen apart. Child mortality would be soaring probably up to every other child below 5 years old, but with the help of healing magic, that wasn’t the case at all.\nHe wondered what was the philosophy behind his actions, and if evil could easily be quantified. He had so much time to think, and because he had a functioning brain, he didn’t just sit there and plot narrowly around murder. If he had such a narrow-minded brain, he wouldn’t succeed. It was through taking in everything as much as possible that he would be able to make effective decisions when the time came to kill. This was why killing was difficult, because when factors such as starvation, malnutrition, and living in a war-torn country were not at play, it demanded a very conscious decision.\nHe realized that he didn’t need to kill after all. It was not the world he lived in. It was the world he had believed he lived in.\nHe couldn’t find a good reason to kill. It was not pragmatic anymore to kill the way he did.\nBut he didn’t experience guilt the same others did, so the only thing he could do was accept that what he had done was wrong.\nHe didn’t need to be right anyway. He didn’t have an ego to defend in the same way many others did. His relationship with his actions and his sense of self was unique to his circumstances.\nWith the same succinctness that he annihilated his former village, he came to terms with the consequences of his actions and acknowledged that moving away from that kind of life would be more pragmatic.\nTo explain the reasoning behind his change of mind, he was intelligent in terms of being able to manipulate and do complex social things without remorse, so that was be a sign that his intelligence could lead to an intellectual acceptance of the lack of pragmatic value that violence held. Moreover, Richard provided that opportunity by exposing Mark to new frameworks for empathy, community and viewing others and himself. Furthermore, curiosity, a natural facet of intellect, led to the fiasco with Sophia Strong, but it also provided him with knowledge and power he wouldn’t have had if he didn’t experience it. Lastly, he did experience guilt to some capacity.\nUltimately, Mark had reformed.\nShifting away from this cumulative accomplishment, Mark began his next plan, spending years in study.\n“I want to get an education,” Mark said.\nRichard smiled. “Okay. What kind? If you keep working with me, then I’ll show you all around the town. If you want to read books, we can visit Mrs. Sally. If you want to try swimming, we can go to the lake where you’ll see boys like Adrian and Andrei swimming and fishing…” He continued on and on for thirty minutes, listing down as much names as he could remember and adding details about each one.\nHe ended with, “Whatever you want to do, I can help you.\n“This place can be big enough for you, I promise.”\nRichard lived in this town for his entire life, and not once did he think that it was too small for him. In fact, it kept growing, and everything changed so fast. He remembered what it was like walking by that corner. That used to feel so big and giant. Now, it looked like any other corner he would see when traveling in other towns. He recognized that travelers would see that corner that way. To him, it was so many memories. To others, it never once made a single feathery touch.\nHe believed that people didn’t have to live in a big city to be happy. In fact, he believed that a town only 30 kilometers away from the city was the happiest place to be. Many nobles also lived in towns like these.\nMark knew Richard was likely right, so he decided to stay for a year or two.\nHe stayed for a year, and he didn’t understand many things. But as time passed, he learned.\nOne day, a young man walked around, finding his chest bleeding after he cut it to make room for the spiritual transformation. He found his arms developing emerging spikes. He screamed, his heart bursting with fervor. He giggled before laughing. The arrogance bled from his jaw.\nHe learned that the only true joy in the world arose from murder.\nHe slashed, crushing the heretical bastards, running into the streets, finding Richard and Mark selling.\nMark tilted his head before running.\nThe young man stopped, glancing around and assessing his situation relative to Mark.\nMark stopped as well.\nThe young man slowed down and prepared to fight Mark carefully.\nMark grabbed a blade and looked around. He flourished his sword skillfully, amazing the onlookers.\nThe young man squinted before charging.\nMark smiled before using a spell that allowed him to teleport a short distance away.\nThe young man had committed already, so the reinforcements on Mark’s side caught him, killing him quickly.\nMark got a nod from the adventurers who ate at his and Richard’s shop.\nMeanwhile, several other goblins, tired from the lonesome feeling of being crushed and beaten. How long had they been tortured? How long had they been hidden away by adventurer scum.\nThey screamed for the rise of freedom.\nThey ran, bursting down the cages with the help of a secret helper among the prison guards.\nThe guards fell apart to the onslaught, having lessened their numbers in preparation for a coming war. It was a bad decision by the ruler, but what could the guards do?\nThey were massacred.\nThe goblins screamed. Did they see them? Did they see the beauty in death!\nThey ran around, crowding the way out of the prison into the streets.\nHundreds of them gathered at the city center, catching the attention of a mobilized army of soldiers.\nThe soldiers charged, cutting through the goblin horde.\nThe goblin squealed, casting magic with their hands and feet chained.\nThe soldiers fell apart slightly before bouncing back and overwhelming the goblins.\nThe last goblin ran clumsily and hastily, his foot getting caught on a rock. He tripped, stumbling before catching himself. He stood up and burst into a dash, his feet getting sick and tired, aching from the pain. He saw a way out—a door leading to a vast field.\nBut Mark stood there, watching him.\nSeeing the soldiers behind him, the goblin ran, raising his sword.\nMark slashed and beat it down, crushing its leg.\nThe screams of the goblin made the soldiers call out to Mark to preclude his attempt to torture the goblin to death.\nMark nodded, making himself look meek.\nThe soldiers quickly gathered and pulled the goblin away, the goblin’s screams dying down and becoming faint overtime.\nMark sniffed the air, smelling the blood of the goblin. He knew that blood was just an object, and he knew that the scream was just a sound.\nThe goblin was a different species from human beings. He knew that as well.\nHe knew that whatever he would do next had consequences.\nHe knew that he had power.\nHe tilted his head, watching the buildings around him. Even if they loomed over him, he didn’t feel that at all.\n[Your body has heated up slightly with a sense of empowerment. +1 XP]\nTo explain his seemingly contradictory behavior, it was okay to pretend. He would pretend for a long time. The comfort, the complexities of social groups, and the knowledge gained through interacting intimately with the populace were all necessary components to destroy. One year was enough for him to soak up experience in an otherwise disorienting new city, since he had lived all his life in a village. This was not calculated. It was patient and brooding, allowing him to hold his cards together until the perfect time struck. His enemies would come to him, using up all their cards and energy just to get his attention. But his teeth, ever so soft, would show their fangs at just the right time.\nHe minded the beggar in front of him, careful not to make unnecessary enemies and dismantle his own reputation, paying respect to the potential hidden strength by others, specifically in his own particularly vulnerable state. Indeed, he lacked information, experience, and vision.\nHe would appear strong when he was weak, and he would appear weak when he was strong. Aggression was not always the winning strategy, and it often wasn’t. Instead, he would bait.\nChapter 7 - The Abyss Within linkHe went up to a tower and watched the city, sighting several strategic locations and vantage points. He climbed up a particular road, sighting the nearby buildings of the city from the side of a small cliff. This road continued up the mountain until he reached the summit, seeing the whole city from a very safe place. Here, he found many travelers, workers, guards, soldiers, and workers roaming around. This strategic location was turned into a waypoint and a self-sufficient community directly connected to the larger town and city.\nIf he wanted to break objectives like this community to destroy the city, he needed knowledge and power. If he knew about the inner workings of the city and how they delegated power, then he might find key individuals responsible for defending this community. Once he found them, he would have to work around his limitations and these particular individuals’ weaknesses. Sometimes, killing them was easiest, but that was rarely the case in a social fabric as cohesive as the city was. But that also meant that these individuals were rarely the best targets. Sometimes, working on indirect ways to dismantle the city’s defences was more effective. Instead of risking massive amounts of resources for the unlikely chance of breaking the defences through assassinating the individuals directly responsible, it was better to hold an office or show promise in a certain field that could lead to a potential intersection between that field and the community. That way, even if it would still be rare, it would give him a better chance at getting information and giving it to an enemy. One man couldn’t just destroy an interconnected city. Moreover, pretending as a regular person for very long was often insufficient to gain enough power to destroy a city. He had to shine and get attention, making himself out of to be of value. If he could do that, then that would allow him two options: he could integrate further into the city or he could utilize the advantage he gained from garnering approval, influence, and power to help enemies of the town and city. Anyway, returning to the social cohesiveness of the city fabric, indeed, the infrastructure that led to various objectives and vantage points was especially potent because they were on mountains that commanded a view of much of the region. The city would be very vulnerable if these objectives were lost, but in the case that they remained strong, the city was impenetrable in terms of vision. He had to study the city dutifully.\nIn the end, a spy could sabotage and gather information to send to an enemy, but he couldn’t just destroy the city if he wanted to. If he had one-use magic that could wipe out an entire city, he would have to have a valid justification to do it if he represented a country, and if he was a non-state actor, he would be hunted down by the entire world who only wanted stability and territory. Furthermore, a terrorist that operated alone was the easiest target. Lastly, the world would probably be hiding magic far stronger than he could ever imagine.\nThis was why he couldn’t just destroy things. This interconnected world would always find a way to hold him accoutable, and if he got away with it, he would have required a vast array of resources beyond his wildest dreams. In some shape or form, his actions would always come back to bite him. That was why he needed to invest into positive efforts if he wanted his negative (destructive) actions to work.\nThis was the “mutual assured destruction and benefit” that civilization offered.\nThroughout one year, he learned all of this with the help of education, and it was all sponsored by his wealthier friends, those that he gained due to being Richard’s employee and friend. This was during his integration with the particular part of town he started with.\nThis was Mark’s more mature, strategic mindset.\nHe met with several boys, having gained an affinity with them through his own childhood memories of play. Certainly, even if he grew up in an unhealthy manner, he could empathize and connect with children.\nHe wanted to understand their mindsets, having low information on the perspective of children and what they would inevitably grow up to be years from now. He didn’t only gain foresight due to this. He gained a broader understanding of instincts, play, and how people operated in teams and potentially in broader schemes of operation. Even if it was small, the nuances of play extended to far-reaching horizons. These were the benefits of exposing himself to children effectively.\nHe met with a group of laborers, having been intercepted by one because they knew him and that he sold sisig and wanted to buy it from him. Their behavior could be characterized by a more mature dynamic between the expectations of work and the elements of play present in their boisterous, inebriated behavior and their sarcastic and satirical humor. Even kids were expected to excel in the realms of study and more primitive precursors to work. However, these laborers had spent many years streamlining their lifestyle toward being a productive enough worker to reach standards while maintaining a certain level of self-care. But their lives had much room for improvements in health, productivity, and wellbeing, given the many issues plaguing them and their society. The adults were not only mature versions of their younger selves, but they were also mature indicators of the pressing issues of the time period they grew up in, having well soaked up the negative effects.\nIt mattered to Mark only to the extent that he understood the weaknesses of his enemy.\nIf his enemy was a child, it was fair game. But no human was ever alone.\nIf his enemy was a laborer, it was fair game. But no human was ever alone.\nIt took intentional effort to be alone, because even the poor were especially more likely to develop strong bonds due to pressing needs they shared.\nThis was why Mark had to be skillful if crushing his enemies totally was the goal.\nThis was why isolating an enemy, both in social groups and in warfare, was most effective.\nAn assassin couldn’t just isolate an enemy physically. An assassination had to have been complemented by other forms of isolation: political, social, socioeconomic, and cultural isolation, among others—support networks, alliances, and societal standing. No one would take revenge for a man unloved by his people. Many wars erupted due to an incomplete assassination, one that focused too much on physically killing the target instead of killing them politically.\nPunching an enemy and triggering a huge explosion were very low-level forms of power. Truly destroying a country’s identity and turning it into something very foreign so as to influence the direction of evey single life birthed in that country potentially for centuries through cheap, strategic means instead of having to spend trillions of cash using hard power was an even higher-level form of power. It was easier to fight against a threat external than that which is introduced insidiously inside that even the white blood cells were insensible to the point that that very human being took that covert injection of subtlety as gospel.\nThis was massacre when it was most unseen and discouraged from conversation because it was “too political.” Even murder could be excused if higher-level forms of power found a way to make people avoid addressing it.\nThis was power.\nThis was the key. He would descend into darkness as he sought revenge and liberation from his oppressive environment.\nSince it had been a year, he had spent much of his time studying rather than getting experience with the broader world as much, he was able to integrate into a community of friends, families, relatives, co-workers, and church mates.\nHe got up, watching the sunset. “How did I ever get here?”\nHe went to church, but today was a strangely weak day. Nothing happened, and he wasn’t given a strong enough power to destroy everything.\nHe even forgot about his ambitions.\nHe was a shadow of the sociopathic murderer that he used to be. Now he was a regular person. It was better than being part of a very vulnerable, marginalized population.\nSo now, his next goal was to break open this earth.\nHe crushed the earth with a mighty hoe. This was a symbolic process.\nHe was regaining his sense of self—the murderer hidden within.\nHe struck and struck. “Come back,” he mouthed. “Come back.”\nHe struck it again and again, striking vertically and diagonally with smooth, elegant motions. He struck it with his heart and with his soul.\nHe wished upon it death.\nThe ground continued to be broken apart, but slowly.\nHe breathed deep, and he found his heart returning to murder.\nHe saw a human being who isolated himself.\nHe hunted him down with a knife.\nHe stabbed him and cut his spine up and down.\nHe enveloped him with his loving touches, breaking him apart his spine.\nHe crushed and stomped his life out of him like removing from him his sense of self and agency. It was like breaking a child from the womb.\nThis was how evil he was.\nHe rendered them to be undying flesh, for he would preserve their agency in himself. He never wasted a breath.\nHe struck again and again.\nThe earth was now broken open.\nHe walked upon the streets, and there he felt at ease because he was now both Regular Person and Tyrannical. But with his regained self, he was also Sociopathic Murderer. These identities continued to simmer and blend together like a hot pot.\nIf someone struck him down during this time, they would have interrupted this ongoing transformation.\nThis was why even now with his newfound power, he needed to be cautious.\nThe human Mark had indeed killed lay on the ground, his agency robbed.\nMark made his way to Richard’s shop, remembering that even now, with the challenges present, he knew that Richard had never intended to put up shop here and stay here for a year. He had wanted only to earn enough money to become a stronger adventurer, but life was harder than he thought.\nMark would exploit that wish.\nHe told Richard that he could help him become an adventurer after months of rejecting Richard’s suggestions to visit the dungeons alongside the adventurers.\nAt the dungeon, Mark waited.\nRichard came out, coming here on Mark’s word.\nMark slashed it, ripping his clothes.\nRichard backed off, raising his hands.\nMark was masked, but his form was telling.\n“Mark?” Richard said, his voice breaking.\nMark broke through his shield and weapons, slashing at his head.\nThe helmet Richard wore blocked it.\nMoreover, other adventurers were coming.\nMark retreated, realizing that this risky decision broke one year of investment. It was not strategical or based on efficiency. It was primal and instinctive, that centered around murder as an elevated mode of function.\nWhile Richard rested nearby, he waited.\nThey wanted to enter the dungeon to find Mark.\nBut Mark didn’t let them do so, as they were afraid of him coming to kill them.\nMark hid further into the dungeon where he encountered monsters.\nHe ran for his life, dodging arrows and the bodies of zombies.\nHe kept going, entering another chamber of the dungeon with a treasure chest.\nBut there was a large monster acting as a boss.\nMark ran, but he was blocked by the zombies and skeletons that followed him.\nHe went around the boss chamber, touching the chest.\nBut it was locked hard.\nHe pulled it, but it was too late.\nHe dodged an attack before leaping to the side, hitting his shoulder against the wall.\nHis life was going to drift away.\nStrategy and effectiveness were lost.\nWhat he needed was a divine savior.\nHe crawled before standing up quickly and burst forward toward the exit.\nHe slipped away, returning to the entrance of the dungeon.\nRichard and the other adventurers weren’t there.\nHe fled into the trees, bleeding from his shoulder.\nHe gritted his teeth, his mind beating hard with ferocity and terror.\nThe near-death made his nerves pop with quickness, and now, the energy crash left him on the ground. Lying like a fragile peanut, he stared at the horizon past the sunlight-colored interstices of the trees.\nHe didn’t have it in him to stand up.\nHe was ashamed and helpless.\nHe got up weakly and kept walking toward the forest.\nBeasts lay there in wait.\nHe gritted his teeth again.\nHe grabbed a makeshift weapon and flourished it in front of the coming, roaring beasts. He begged for mercy, because at this point, it was either he won or he died.\nHe won, crushing the beasts with a total victory, leaving only his legs aching and exhausted. He fell to his knees before falling to the ground sideways. Now, on the ground, he recalled the world he lived in.\nHe imagined his dead face reflected in the eyes of the human he killed earlier.\nThis was helplessness when it was most unseen.\nHe wished only to control the world.\nHe said: “I have to do it. Whatever it takes.”\nHe screamed with pain and frustration, as he got up, hardened by his first near-death full-combat experience.\nNo one would stop him.\nHe realized that he was contradicting himself. He was unstable from the start. The guilt he experienced from eliminating his entire village was real, but he also wanted to “fulfill his destiny to resist the oppressive nature of his environment.” But bloodlust from the empowering feeling killing gave him conflicted with these guilt and this idealism. Moreover, on top of those three, a more mature and strategic mindset emphasizing the long-term only served as part of his thought process, rather than his actual applied behavior.\nIn the end, the desire to become everything—effectively stretching him in so many extreme directions—left him inconsistent as a human being. No one could truly engage in extremely contradictory behavior for too long, not even psychopaths and sociopaths.\nThis sudden break was not just a break from morality. More importantly, it was a momentous mental breakdown overshadowed by a drive to kill. This drive to take control of his insane cognitive dissonance through murder was merely a symptom of an deeply, intricately dysfunctional and distorted psychological landscape.\nThis was only a framework to bring to light the underlying pathology driving his abnormal behavior. It would be different for everyone else.\nThe fact that he survived the dungeon was besides the point, but it did provide room for further psychological exploration, even if his goal was more physical.\nNo one would stop him.\nChapter 8 - The Sociopath’s Descent linkMark stared at the quiet. He realized that after all this time, he made a big mistake. He spent a year in suspense and then ended everything.\nHe shook his head and got up. This was a minor setback.\nHe took out several orbs and went to the city before seeing a lone hunter aiming a bow at a giant scorpion rock creature.\nHe threw one of the orbs, which created a ball-shaped area that drained the life force of anything inside it.\nIt hit the hunter, who fell to the ground and died by hitting his head. The greatness that he was was conquered.\nMark sauntered, leapt to him, and bit him before taking the hunter’s knife and cutting more human flesh. He bit and healed himself up by consuming human flesh. “I don’t need morals to deny this world its disgusting nature.”\nHe raised the knife and plunged again and again.\nHe earned sweet loot from this, having a new enchanted obsidian knife, an enchanted bow, an enchanted robe, an enchanted tunic, an enchanted surcoat, an purple-and-yellow insignia, and several different bracelets that added 5 [Health], [Attack Damage], and [Ability Power] each. He wore it, collecting it and preparing his next bandit attack.\nHe sighted several groups of travelers hiking up from a valley. He drank water from a nearby pond before crawling on all fours to watch them from a thicket.\nAfter they sighted him, he got up and showed the insignia.\nThe travelers nodded, saluting casually.\nMark looked around before blending with the forest.\nHe reappeared in front of one of the travelers, slashing him on the neck. He learned that from Richard. He slashed several more times before the man grabbed his weapon.\nShields emerged from the other travelers.\nMark retreated, looking around for other food to consume.\nHe was hungry, sleepy, and thirsty.\nThe heat was oppressing him.\nIncidentally, he cut a cloth out of his hoodless robe and used it for his head to keep his shoulders extra-padded for the heat. They were particularly sensitive and itchy.\nAnyway, he looked for food, locating a source far away—a group of monkeys.\nHe grabbed them and broke their stride, pushing them to the ground before standing as if to leap and then pulverizing them with a sharp blade.\nThe blade bled them apart, leaving a trace across the earth, as Mark dragged them aside.\nHe retreated, dodging one of the monkey’s attacks toward his person.\nHe slashed the monkey’s arm mid-swing and crushed its posture with his foot, stabbing it several times before knee-choking it.\nThe monkey flailed its arms in fear before it aimed at Mark’s face.\nMark punched it and crushed it before a monkey caught him mid-leap.\nHe slashed it before pushing it to the ground, breaking its stride before immobilizing it with a series of faints. He then turned and stabbed it sideways through the temple. (It fell aside.)\nThe monkeys reached for him together, but he slipped through them and above them by slashing forward in a series of faints, striding quickly ahead toward the travelers.\nHe rushed and arrived there within five hours.\nHaving been thirsty, he drank from several ponds earlier.\nThe travelers watched him before asking if he was there to attack them, summoning totem golems with a giant hole revealing a source of magical fire inside at the end of each limb.\nHe grinned before retreating, shooting a rock at them from afar.\nThe newly emerging magical shields blocked it, while the travelers looked pissed off.\nMark left, drank water, and ate from the monkeys he collected earlier.\nHe grabbed as much items as he could and focused his attention on preparing for the onslaught between him and the adventurers.\nWhen they sighted him, he shot a skill that had come from the common skill–holding manuscripts. He shot 8 skills, breaking their defence multiple at a time.\nHe shot a rock and pissed them off, stealing their patience.\nOne of them broke out and stabbed at Mark with a spear.\nMark postured for it, slashing the spear enough to make the man fall forward. He pushed him back before slashing him at the perfect distance.\nThe man fell to the ground, as several others moved forward to help the man.\nHe slashed several of them, destroying their already-broken defences. He stabbed them one by one, cleaning them up and leaving them on the ground.\nHe collected their items and located the most important ones, sorting them by order of importance.\nHe had them put into a bag before equipping some of the wearable items, drinking the healing potions, switching his sword with a more powerful spear, and consuming two skill-giving manuscripts luckily left unused.\nHe gained a colorful appearance from the different styles of the original owners of the various items he now wielded as part of his person.\nHe moved forward, locating a group of adventurers attending a coalition raid. Furthermore, they were alone, having separated from the group within the dungeon in order because they were specialized for a specific chamber.\nFor context, he visited this dungeon in hopes of collecting information, and that was how he found them walking in one of the larger hub chambers.\nAfter replenishing himself adequately outside, he entered the chamber where these adventurers were in through the dungeon entrance and hallway, having passed through many different chambers to get to them.\nOne of the adventurers was quick to ask for help.\nBut he said no, saying that it was advisable for him to focus on gaining experience alone. He said that he would wait for them to finish before he continued their work.\nAs soon as the adventurers finished, he eliminated them one by one, since they didn’t have spells off cooldown anymore.\nThe armor failed to protect them long enough, shattering under the weight of his many skills.\nHe stabbed their necks one by one, putting them aside once it was over.\nHe watched their bodies decaying slowly, their faces like dog-shaped macabre objects.\nHe aimed his focus toward the monsters arriving.\nHe grabbed the bodies and threw them, taking the smallest and youngest body and consuming it.\nWith a sigh of satisfaction, he left the scene, exiting the dungeon and lying in wait near the entrance.\nHis patience was unravalled, and the only thing he needed to do next was contain and control.\nSo after the first group of adventurers exited the dungeon, not being able to wait to get home.\nHe dropped the boulders he had prepared, slaying only one adventurer.\nBut it was enough to terrorize the rest.\nHe retreated before he was seen.\nThe adventurers were in a state of terror after one adventurer came from inside the dungeon and reported the deaths of the adventurers inside one of the chambers that was supposed to have been the location of a specialized mission.\nMark was relentless, slowing his stride to watch for steps. He didn’t want to have his focus and relaxation deterred when he had completed so many tasks today.\nBeing tired, he fell asleep on a tree, putting his back next to a bush of leaves and having his head-supporting arm fall asleep and cramping the day after.\nHe woke up with a startle, feeling his itchy butt, neck, and skin on his arms. He wasn’t used to this, but he would have to cope.\nHe ran back down the diagonal-shaped tree and rested near the dungeon entrance, sighting several adventurers looking at him.\nHe ran when he saw their suspicious, intense looks.\nHe was caught, saying that he was a hunter who hunted large scorpion beasts, showing his insignia.\nThey nodded, believing him.\nHe left, following a trail that led to another dungeon. This was a larger dungeon, and it came after a large river that he couldn’t pass.\nHe waited for a canoe paddler to come get him. Since he had to pay, he used the gold coins he got from the bodies and went to the other side of the river, finding the dungeon waiting at the horizon.\nHe travelled for a while before taking a break, finding himself in need of various containers to put his things in.\nHe only was able to get little things from the bodies of the adventurers who died in the chamber yesterday. But today, if ever he encountered a large group like that again, he would need a lot of large containers in order to supply himself for long.\nHe found a group of travelers that were seeking lodging.\nHe joined them, saying that he was a hunter and showing his insignia. Since he was an adept conversationalist, he operated them like a cannon, guiding them toward the understanding that he was a fair, common-thinking man, one that followed the rules but hated the nobles. This was the way common people thought, so he followed suit in his interactions. He didn’t actually want to express his deep-seated feelings of anger, and he could control them easily.\nHe slept after paying the inn receptionist and slept in one of ten rooms, staying at the room farthest from the entrance. He wanted to have his next actions be secret.\nHe located a coming guest who wasn’t staying at the inn, but he was entertaining people. He noticed that he wanted free lodging and drink, so he watched him, pretending to be entertained. Afterwards, Mark suggested that he would pay the fee needed to stay the night.\nWhen the man agreed, he handed the man the money and waited for him to tire. As soon as he headed to one of the rooms, Mark told the man that he stayed at the room farthest from the entrance, indirectly insisting that it was a good idea for the man to do so as well. When the man entered his room, Mark pushed the man inside and killed him.\nSome people saw him, but they thought they were friends or lovers.\nSo he was able to kill the man smoothly without question.\nAfter man died from getting stabbed through the head, he threw the man outside the window, noticing earlier that the windows at the rooms farthest from the entrance were safe and hidden.\nHe dropped the body and left through the window, leaving the body behind the inn. Some people went there and saw him, but he merely said that he was looking for the bathroom. They didn’t believe him, but he said that he could pay them. Before the men caught him off guard with an attack, he killed these unprepared, unarmored, and exhausted laborers and threw them behind him. He almost got his progress restarted since he was exhausted himself. Killing two grown men drained the last of his strength, so he returned to the same inn and fell asleep.\nThe night before, the receptionist questioned him, but he lied and told her that she was wrong about seeing him go up to the rooms already.\nReturning to the present, he left the inn in a rush, wanting to avoid the city and the forest in the meantime to cover his tracks.\nHe chose the forest and hid in one of the palm trees.\nAfter several days had passed and many groups of adventurers passed the area where he slept, he escaped and went to another forest and hid in a palm tree there.\nAfter a whole week, he left the insecure border and entered a much larger rainforest, finding various species of animals and plants along the way.\nHe was stuck, having spent most of his time preparing to kill Richard only to fail. The good thing was that he was skilled enough to do so much.\nLong after the patrols stopped months later, he reentered the city, finding that the wanted posters of him had grown old.\nHe looked distinct enough from the posters to blend in with the populace.\nHe entered the same forest and found that the roads were much better in certain places and certain dungeons were fortified while others looked abandoned. He concluded that the city had consolidated itself in response to some threat or because of some factors.\nHe entered the dungeon, finding himself at a loss when he noticed that the adventurers he expected to see were long gone. They had been replaced by miners.\n“What’s this?” he demanded, asking where the adventurers were.\nThe miners said that the city had not been an adventurer branch for two months already.\nMark was astounded, so he looked for adventurers in the city and found so few people who wore typical adventurer clothes like before.\nHe might have changed the city when he engaged in those killings.\nHe relocated to a different city, finding himself with a whole new set of ponds waiting in store.\nHe drank from them and found the water they provided particularly delicious.\nHe ate meat from bodies that had long rotten inside dungeons. It was a good thing monsters didn’t just stay in one place after killing adventurers.\nThe dungeon was full of life, but he didn’t want to eliminate monsters. He focused his attention on making sure he created a small slice of life.\nHe began to integrate once again into the populace.\nHe saw a group of ladies taking part in an event.\nChapter 9 - Ascent to Power: Establishing Criminal Connections and Delegating Responsibilities linkHe saw the ladies dancing, and he watched them as part of a small audience.\nHe saw their opportunity and gave them money, supporting them.\nHe showed even more money and said that if they kept dancing but changed their location to a place near where people could eat, they would get more money.\nListening to his suggestion, the ladies didn’t want to take it at first, fearing that the man would be much more controlling afterwards, but after a few days, they moved to an area near food stalls.\nMark was there, supporting them as usual, but this time, he wasn’t the only one. A group of men, women, and children emerged to support her.\nThe ladies, at the end of their dance event, were glad to have gotten so much support.\nMark represented their new support, especially after he finished their dance by offering the audience a way to help the ladies. He said that if they gave the ladies orbs, manuscripts, and other adventurer items, the ladies would be able to chase their dreams as dancers.\nThe ladies didn’t know what to do, so they let him say all that.\nWhen adventurers, who enjoyed watching the dancers, heard Mark say that at the end of each dance event, they soon began donating manuscripts, orbs, and items that they didn’t think were useful. Since it was not money and they only wanted “useless” stuff, they didn’t think it was predatory.\nAs for what the ladies got, Mark continued to advise them on how they could get more dancers, being someone with a year-long experience in selling food at a large stall alongside Richard.\nThis became a cycle, one that both the ladies, Mark, and the audience benefitted from.\nSooner or later, Mark was raking in items of all kinds, increasing his skill count and orbs by so many. He found himself with so many new equipment as well.\nAfter supporting them for so long, he pressed the suggestion for them to take a break for a day and that he would explain to the audience that it was their anniversary or the birthday of one of them.\nAfter they agreed, he left to the forest, bringing some of the items he had hidden in 10 large chests and other containers.\nHe saw a group of travelers, finding himself troubled by their silence. He would usually hear them bantering, joking, and gossiping.\nAfter a while, he shot at them with a bow, striking one of them down.\nHe returned to invisibility, blending between the interstices between the trees.\nHe shot at them again, striking a magical shield.\nHe was starting to realize the commonness of magic shields.\nHe shot again and again, moving to different angles to surprise them each time.\nAfter the travelers retreated, he followed them, shooting them down one by one until the last traveler merely ran in his general direction. This last traveler got shot in the head.\nHe was inexperienced with bows, but since he spent months only hiding, he was able to train himself to wield the bow.\nHe admitted he perfected the craft, watching the last enemy fall to the ground.\nHe pulled them together and roped them to make them look like targets of a group or something. He wanted to make his tracks look less obvious and repetitive. It would make it harder to point the incident to him if none of his crime scenes looked the same.\nHe used the bodies as food and cooked them under a fire. It was hard to start a fire, but he learned that too over the months he was hiding. It was satisfying to admit that he had not wasted a single second.\nHe made sure to take off their stuff first before burning them. This would make them look like victims of a group kill more, since if it was just one person, it would likely look less like they had been tied up and burned by many hands.\nHe had to maximize the tomfoolery expected from a group of bandits.\nFurthermore, he made sure to leave most of the items behind.\nHe didn’t want to hide for months again clearly.\nAfter returning to the city, he immediately contacted the ladies to prepare them mentally for tomorrow and to show that he truly cared about them even when they weren’t actively making him money in the form of adventurer items.\nHe ate with them at an expensive restaurant, not making it obvious that he was doing it to bribe them further into his control.\nIt only looked like a wealthier person wanting to start a new enterprise and treating his employees to delicious food as part of an after-work session.\nWhen the ladies were finally full, he asked them if they knew anyone else that needed helping.\nHe didn’t want to make them feel that their positions were being threatened by future connections so as to discourage them from helping him network. So he showed them a magical contract that they would be working together for a year.\nThe ladies agreed, finding the idea of earning well for a year exciting and ambitious.\nWith the contract signed, the ladies finally got a salary directly from Mark, and they immediately helped Mark network more.\nMark learned about a hundred more people and requested the ladies to notify these new people about Mark before he made contact with them himself in person. This would facilitate the process and earn him a way into the network without looking like a random.\nAt the end of their session, they parted ways casually, and Mark realized that it would take months to go through all these hundred people, since the ladies were surely not going to want to spend the time to notify them in person about Mark in only a week.\nSo in the meantime, he supported the ladies, waiting months. He didn’t hunt stray people in the meantime, leaving his tracks clear.\nWhen he finally made contact with the hundred people, he was now a more established gentleman in a society, having coming into his own socially, similar to how a noble would debut into society.\nHe was among non-nobles though, but it was still sufficient for his proceedings, having contacted various adventurers with connections to higher powers.\nIndeed, this encroaching establishment of violence and power (social and political)-control was his modus operandi.\nHe broke the will of flesh and the sky of mind. He raised his banner like a man of victory and a man of failure.\nHe showed off his greatness like a cloak, flourishing it and sensually dancing according to the tune expected from him.\nHe was establishment. He was greatness. He was I-see-I kind of creation. He was the fulfillment of all injustices.\nHe was gambit.\nThis more grandiose self-image was pragmatic in order to navigate an even higher realm of social needs, that of the need to impress and charm the likes of nobles.\nHe danced, ripping apart the lossy lines and preying upon those he mocked. He shut out the criticisms and cast his mocking gaze upon the ethereal and the magical, proclaiming his dividence (divine confidence; division)—the bifurcation into true darkness.\nBut it was all mechanistic.\nAfter gaining a vast sea of societal authority, he left to the forest, embracing the night like a sea bat.\nHe entered the aftermath of a monster-human engagement and gorged the various bodies therein, replenishing himself.\nHe sliced several bodies to warm up and retrain himself.\nFor the next several weeks, he practiced his fighting skills to return to efficiency and streamlined ease.\nAfterwards, when the ladies took a break again, he returned to the forest again, having obtained new items by looting the bodies.\nOnly bringing some of his items again, collecting specific range of items for his particular job. He sighted a wizard practicing in the forest and shot a bow at her.\nThe wizard fell, blasting magic toward him.\nHe collected the carcass and dumped it in a pond, looking at how the blood made this murky galaxy-like fog with many long outstretched lines that, if looked from a very close view, looked like roots.\nHe ran, waiting for someone to check the pond to drink.\nHe saw a bunch of archers, and they gasped at the sight of the body.\nHe walked up to them and slashed all of them to death, finding one of them hard to kill due to being trained in spear combat, using a shield, and certain skills.\nHis new assortment of skills, items, and orbs overwhelmed them though.\nHe had identified their skills though, and he already knew what they did, only targeting enemies that lay far beneath his presumed level of strength.\nHe almost always beat them by a landslide however, even if he expected to be a closer fight than usual. This meant that he was just that cautious and prepared, always focusing on taking gold, getting items, orbs, and manuscripts, and patiently waiting for enemies to make mistakes.\nThe problem was that mistakes were everywhere.\nAnd that was because they weren’t walking around and traveling expecting to get hit by one of their own. They could prepare for bandits, but it depended on the class of bandit.\nHe was different class of criminal, being one of a superior caliber.\nHe grabbed their bodies and dumped them into the same pond they had drunk from. This was after grabbing everything useful and taking a few bites from them.\nHe waited again.\nHe wished he could delegate this resource-collecting process that so happened to involve killing and maiming adventurers to other lesser bandits. The issue was that he had not stretched far into the criminal underworld.\nHe saw a group of bandits hiding at one of his previous hiding spots and also waiting for people to come to the pond.\nHe confronted them, saying that he was stronger than them by a long shot.\nThe bandits were fast to shoot ranged skills and arrows at him, seeing a lone target.\nHe retreated, reciprocating their projectiles.\nBut the bandits were much stronger, tougher, and more prepared to fight against other people. In fact, Mark survived very long for a lone target, indicating that he was probably also a bandit himself.\nThe bandits stopped due to this realization, offering Mark a position among them.\nMark said that a non-predatory magical contract that prevented friendly fire had to be signed.\nThey did, and Mark was accepted among the bandits.\nThe bandits prepared him for a mission, offering training aids since they were skilled at keeping each other prepared and trained for human-human combat.\nMark was quick to learn, sometimes guiding the bandits themselves in training.\nThe bandits didn’t know everything, so they happily complied with his rare advice.\nSoon enough, these bandits connected Mark to a broader criminal system organized under a boss.\nSince a bandit organization was often loose like an adventurer guild, they spent most of their time working as adventurers or in adventurer-adjacent professions undercover. This made it easier to explain their physique.\nMark never got into adventuring, but he was tasked with working as an adventurer undercover.\nWhen he did so, he immediately had to slow down his interactions with the ladies and delegate this task to a team. This was better for the ladies since Mark was never that involved and studied in dancing. Moreover, even if Mark wasn’t there, many others had his type of people and street skills but better. So Mark didn’t care to preen in that facilitator role with respect to the ladies. He began interviewing and filtering through connections, expecting it to last months.\nReturning to the bandit organization and Mark being an adventurer, he switched tasks to that of someone who acted as an ambush initiator, especially since they learned that he killed the archers earlier.\nOne day, when the ladies had a break day, he met up with a group of bandits, and they immediately moved to a scene Mark suggested.\nHere, they waited, and Mark noticed that none of the bandits were wearing fitting clothes for sleeping on trees. He realized then why he was more skilled than these bandits at hunting humans. He had much more experience living in the wild alone.\nThe process to delegating the hunting to the bandits was going to be very long, since he needed to become the boss.\nSimilarly, finding the right people to delegate the task of facilitator for the ladies was also a lengthy process.\nHe sought advice from his connections, finding that some of them wanted to help him out of their own good will.\nChapter 10 - Bonds of Fate linkAfter helping the bandits, back at the city, Mark walked around, being watched by a group of men far away.\nTheir smiles were bright.\nIt was a new day for them, and everyday was a quiet moment of celebration. As long-time friends, they concluded that it was easy to live in a world as cruel as this when one had friends behind one’s back.\nSoon, when they left, they disappeared into a church.\nMark found himself standing in the distance behind them.\nHe followed them.\nMeanwhile, the men sat down, talking happily with the people around them.\nMark didn’t know what he was missing.\nEventually, the men saw him and gestured at him, motioning him to come close.\nMark glanced from side to side and behind him before he turned to the men, who continued to beckoned him forward.\nThey had him sit down next to them, treating him as a friend.\n“How are you, brother?” said one of them, Markus, his smile as genuine as what Mark had did to his first village.\nMark stared at the ground for a second before he looked up in response, his brows raising. “Oh, me? I’m alright… How are you?” He was just letting things happen.\nMarkus grinned. “How’s it been? I’ve been seeing you there and here with the girls and the adventurers.”\n“You…? Really? I didn’t know that.” Mark genuinely didn’t know, but now, gathering information, he would know everything.\nThe man showed him the three others. “He’s…”\n“I’m Lot, and this is Rebekah,” said one of the three, his arms around the women next to him. From Mark’s eyes, their dynamic looked standard, and the woman didn’t show any subtle emotions indicating otherwise. “How…” He kept talking, but Mark tuned him out.\nIn the meantime, Rebekah nodded in a way that made it look more like she was shrugging. After a few good looks, Mark recognized this was only a mannerism, underscoring the idea that her mannerisms were the only thing distinct about her, her role in the group serving as a mere function. Indeed, she was invisible among the men, Mark having not registered her enough to call the group three men and one woman and only seeing them as a group of men.\nAnyway, the last person among the three said, “I’m Esau…” He talked long as well, saying things that weren’t too important to Mark’s journey.\nAfter the introductions, the first speaker, Markus, gave his name, prompting Mark to say that their names were similar before revealing that his name was “Mark.”\nThe two bonded over the same name, and soon enough, they were eating at a carinderia. The men lived simple lives, so they laughed over simple things.\nMark found them hilarious as well, discovering it easy to laugh when his whole life had been so tense and marked by an almost feverish ambition toward ruthless behavior.\nHe was a self-aware person, but that didn’t stop him from engaging in bloodshed.\nA young adventurer came close, having stopped riding his lizard mount to ask questions about a guild entrapment between him and two other individuals wanting him dead in the pond. It was less about actual murder and more about reputational loss and removal of respect in the guild. So he was in a hurry to gather information, just like Mark was.\nMark wasn’t the only system collecting data.\nSoon, Markus concluded to the young adventurer, having wasted some time to tell a good story he had been keeping to himself for a while now: “It was then that they were declared dead. I couldn’t stop laughing at how fast it all happened. But that was not all. Every time I sat there, I was immediately pulled in by how unstoppably fast that guy was. Like, how do you even… Is that like a super power, brother! Honestly, that wasn’t everything, but that’ll do for now. You should check at the information gathering guild. They should help.”\nThe young man left, gesturing awkwardly and with a troubled stare at Markus.\nMark didn’t really feel anything, but it was nice to see life that didn’t revolve around him.\nEven a sociopathic murderer needed foot massages.\nHe was massaging his feet right now as he sat, putting one leg over the other with his sandals on the ground. To easy any concerns, it was not impolite or indecent to do this among the everyday folk. In fact, it was common and a cultural trait.\nSoon enough, the men were dancing and imitating someone, laughing all the while. This made Mark snicker as well.\nIt was hard not to like people genuinely in a good mood and friendly.\nMark smiled, eroding the thick ice wall that preventing him from connecting deeper with the men.\nEventually, Rebekah proactively walked up to him, releasing herself from her Lot’s adjacence. “You guys didn’t ask Mark whether he wants to stay or not. Did you guys even invite him to church?”\nMarkus responded: “Yes! You saw it yourself! We did! But of course, we’ll let him stay with us. Mark, do you need somewhere to sleep? We can let you stay with us.”\nMark didn’t know how safe it was, so he declined politely. If he ended up going with them, who knew what would happen to his body?\nNow that that ended, he soon found himself at the feet of a larger inn, entering inside.\nVarious people threw paper cards on the ground playing board games. It was an unusual atmosphere, but it was focused, polite, and almost looked like a discussion between men of high power. But in the end, the polite silence was due to the tense phase of the round they were on.\nMark sat down, grabbing a chair from on a table and placing it down, making a slight noise.\nIt didn’t bother the people too much since it was only as loud as the intermittent coughs.\nBut when he sat, he soon found his eyes adjusting to the dimness of the inn, his focus gravitating toward the focus of the orange lamps.\nThey were seated around a single table, centered upon two people playing their last moves.\nWhen they expanded their game time, various sides of the inn began whispering.\nEventually, it ended, and the whole crowd erupted with playful jeers and applause.\nMark was a little lost, but later, when the crowd began clearing, he sat down at the counter and asked for a drink from the servers, glancing at two women wearing archers’ clothes. He was astonished at how much more sway they held here that they could just wear these battle clothes compared to his village of birth. Though he was surprised at Rebekah’s level of authority within the group of men earlier, it was still within his ingrained understanding of reasonable limits. Even now, he still retained numerous attributes and sings of his lineage and upbringing, but he was more open-minded. He had to be, or else he would not survive in this city that expected much from its citizens. Even more relevantly, it expected barely anything from rural-to-urban immigrants like him.\nIf he wanted to survive, he would have to take hold of opportunities, not just as a man of suave business-think, but as an everyday man according to these cityfolk.\nTo grab hold of a red flag of opportunity, he walked outside and waited.\nAfter some time, various people went out, but he was looking for someone lost or someone particularly lonely or vulnerable.\nAfter a while, the two women came out, but he didn’t see a sign of weakness from them.\nSooner or later, he found an older man stumbling about, sitting down on his haunches a short distance from a stall.\nMark approached him and asked for directions to probe into how the older man would respond.\nThe older man gradually stood up, shaking. After stabilizing himself, he pointed and made sounds with his mouth nonverbally. It was just a mannerism this time. The man had a condition.\nThe older man was an easy target, but Mark found more opportunity in looking for a vulnerable young master than a lost older man on the street.\nSo his first idea was to find a way to get this man on his side if ever he needed someone with his particular set of skills.\nHe told the man that he would buy food for him for giving him directions without asking for anything.\nThe older man was surprised, but he soon nodded.\nMark was a kind person, if it counted toward his goals.\nGlimpses of humanity and nuance could be seen even within the sociopathic framework.\nMark had the older man follow him. He didn’t want to underestimate him. In fact, he was worried that the older man would begin to love him excessively. However, if the older man remained dependent on him, that was his independence to act freely and remain in poise with his social environment.\nAt the guild, the older man and Mark stood in front of a giant lobby, darting adventurers zipping past and treading with gigantic footsteps. The place was a fountation of activity, providing avenues through which Mark could soar. But Mark didn’t want to soar. He was an egg, waiting to break out of its cage to crawl upon the slithering vines, fully engorged with hope. This was salvation when it was most frail, because right now, he truly was an outsider with very little connections. In the village, he knew 100% of the village. Here, he knew much, much less than 1 percent of the whole city. This was his perspective on the issue.\nThat was why the older man was his first knowable thing. If he could get more knowables like cards on a playing deck, then the time to launch a ferocious attack on the board would be surely optimal-optimum.\nFor clarity, knowables were items or pieces of information that were within the realm of knowledge or understanding.\nMark struck treasure chest gold when a three young adventurers took them in as part of a mission into the muddy hills, where goblins would be hiding in caves.\nThe good thing was that Mark was an experienced climber, being a man of a village close to a mountain range.\nThis was why he went bare-foot at the event a few days later.\nThe older man was with him, and so was another woman, the one he spoke to at the faction before. As for why he wasn’t working at the faction yet, he never signed up, only having assessed the place. It would have been a bad idea to take the first sign of light given to him, when he lacked so much information at the time.\nAnyway, the woman and the older man had two different goals in mind. The woman wanted to remain in connection with Mark, whom she saw as one having authority, while the older man merely wanted someone to attach to in his time of great need.\nMark could exploit both requirements. The woman’s was superficial, while the older man’s was easily paid in roughly pressed gold coins.\nHe didn’t even know their names, and that made it all the more easier to commit to the plan, his guilt bearing no presential burden upon his mind’s eye.\nHis clarity was perfect.\nHe shot at a goblin, pushing it again and again with his awkward rocks, soon enough tearing it away from its grasp on the hillside and causing it to tumble down toward its concussion.\nMark was tasked with clearing away the goblins advancing by the hillside. With the pressure release one by one with every goblin fall, the woman, the older man, and the three young adventurers rushed into the cave, slashing every goblin in their sight.\nThe older man was tasked with blocking, and even if he was malnutritioned, Mark had been feeding him these past few days. And with Mark’s oversight, the older man had decided to join up.\nThe goblins fell one way or the other.\nThe team was no longer bound by the fleshling nailed grips the goblins spurred.\nBut he would embrace them for as long as he wanted, because they were bound by fate. And six years was long enough for people to have known each other their entire lives, only for it to dissipate suddenly as if it was all a surreal, disorienting dream of a man who was and used to be and never became again.\n(He could love and be a part of someone’s life for their “entire lives.” But sooner or later, it would dissipate suddenly as if it was all a surreal, disorienting dream of a man who was and used to be and never became again. He didn’t hate them or would severe their relationship. To be more accurate, even the most meaningful connections that might have seemingly been bound by destiny grew apart. Him embracing them for as long as he wanted meant that he could be with them and be a part of their lives with a sense of freedom and strong intimate investment.)\nIn conclusion, Mark might have conversed with them. But in his view, it was not equality in the sense that it meant neither to rule or be ruled. He “ruled” over the older man and the woman. This was like violence in that it was mute and that it could never be great—a prepolitical act. But slaves were subject to violence.\nTo offer a more hopeful interpretation, the older man and the woman chose this path, and Mark was engaging in the facsimile of “collective housekeeping” (Volkswirtschaft).\nChapter 11 - Embracing Change link Author’s Note\nThe schedule will change to 8 PM EST. I appreciate your understanding.\nMark stood at a hill, raising his weapon and slashing at a goblin.\nThe goblin blocked his attack and struck him several times in the gut before kicking him away.\nThe goblin ran, dodging several arrows, but he soon slowed down to a magical effect draining his life force.\nMeanwhile, Mark fell back and hit the ground, saved by a healer.\nHe was in a battle, and it had been three days since the mission.\nHe was no longer fighting with the intention to kill. He was fighting with the intention to assess his opponents—the goblins were surely enemies. But he was talking about the adventurers he fought alongside.\nHe aimed a bow at a goblin, failing miserably. He joined up a line of archers for a volley. It was a loose organization from these archers to the rest of the adventurers in this skirmish, so he voluntarily lined up to shoot.\nEven with his bad aim, the volley was able to keep out goblin reinforcements crossing a mountain pass.\nMark was beginning to tire, his arms aching terribly.\nEven with his numerous skills, he could only provide so much damage against a coordinated goblin foe. The barriers and harnessing of terrain and fortifications to mitigate area-of-effect damage and completely nullify certain magical attacks made him helpless.\nBut this was a lesson for him in warfare mechanics.\nIf he wanted to kill, guerilla hunt-downs were effective to some degree, but it was also very taxing. He lost so much potential waiting out adventurers and killing them when he could be upgrading his skills, hunting more powerful enemies with more powerful rewards, and gaining reputation as a reliable and trusted beacon of the community. All the advantages of society he didn’t have were there in the fog, waiting for him.\nHe hardened his fists and stood up.\nLarge artillery explosions rippled across the adventurer forces, dismantling their mage formations.\nMany died in this skirmish, and eventually, the humans were forced to retreat, as the goblins chased them down on all fours, slaying them rapidly.\nMark and some others found themselves back at their fortified camp, but they had clearly lost.\nSo they fled the camp as well, hoping the camp’s forfications to slow them down.\nMark kept running.\nMany groups were separating to catch fleeing, isolated adventurers.\nMark used one of his spells to dig underground and hid. It would do for now.\nOnce they were gone, he returned to the city, thirsty more than he was hungry. His lungs were aching, and his legs were heating up, his back sweating and prickly, the back of his hands wet with sweat from his head. He walked like a zombie.\nBut when he returned, he immediately washed and fixed himself up.\nTime never waited for anyone.\nSo he armed himself and put on whatever armor and equipment he had like rings, gems, amulets, bracelets, and belts.\nWalking outside, his next goal was to embrace the more peaceful side of the city with the hope of disparaging it in the long term. His patience failed before. It would not fail again.\nSoon, while he foraged around and assessed the environment, several goblins appeared in the horizon.\nHe stopped, begging them for a fair fight.\nThe goblins watched his every move, walking close.\nMark glanced at the other goblins standing farther away, a tree and some vegetation partially blocking his view of them.\nMark waited for the goblin to make a decision.\nBut the goblin was only slowly taking a stance, as if it had not done it several times before. It began to form a gesture—that which expressed his desire for peace.\nMark nodded and readily showed what he presumed to be the same gesture.\nThe goblin gave an affirming nod, and soon enough, their fight ended with peace without verbal communication.\nMark decided to befriend the goblins, showing them gifts that he had prepared.\nThe goblins took these gifts respectfully and commanded their youngest member to offer a gift of their own.\nThis communication event marked a new step in Mark’s progress as a bandit, especially since he had been tasked to visit the goblins by his bandit lord.\nBut even as he was being commanded, he had utter freedom to create connections that only he could.\nHe offered his skills as a hunter, describing humans and how he slew them as if they were animals, but never saying once that he was referring to humans.\nThe goblins readily listened, and soon, their connection became economically organized, as they offered each other a quest and accepted.\nMark’s quest for the goblins was to hand him information about skills, levels, and stats from the knowledge systems the goblins had accrued over centuries.\nThe goblins’ quest involved damning the human freaks one by one and handing them their heads, which they referred to as “pellets.” It was then that the goblins clearly expressed their understanding of Mark’s man-hunter role.\nMark was also informed that they could make arrangements for the human captives to be released if their “arrangement”’ was “productive.” He was sure that these captives included the camp followers from the goblin-human engagement earlier.\nHe accepted the offer, hoping to rope in more companions that would love to get on board with anyone saving human captives. If different kinds of people relied on his authority more, then naturally, it would be easier to move through the strata of civilization. Essentially, it meant more power.\nOverall, having set up early leads in various areas, including bandits, goblins, an entertainment business, his position was much more secured, and people would be willing to work with him instead of against him, depending on how much others needed his authority.\nShifting to a more interesting acquisition from this partnership, the goblins showed him a path to a goblin seaside fishing town with 50 families actively living there.\nMark joined them, walking alongside them by the rugged, mudded, rock-studded trails that ran and spread through a tropically vast and diverse ecoregion of opportunity and potential development; though, because of this high potential, it was important to promote policies that aligned with a approach that could sustain its breeding ground perpetually.\nThe light shone upon the town, and soon, Mark found various walking simple people walking, some carrying logs on wagons, the sounds of working in the shops, among other details.\nHe came toe-to-toe with a new way of living life, that of simple progression.\nHe noticed that being in this village granted him a sense of experience.\nEven the [System] rewarded him so.\n[Your body has learned to love simplicity! This is empowerment! +1 XP]\nMark didn’t understand what this meant for him moving forward, but he had a long history of violence. And he knew that he couldn’t just reject who he was. He would inevitably return to that cycle.\nMaybe, he was wrong.\nMaybe, he could change.\nBut he didn’t want to spend too long figuring it out.\nSo after staying there for a while, he found out that the town itself had a hidden entrance to a dungeon.\nEven if there weren’t any humans there, he knew well that sooner or later, he would grab the next human blocking his way and drag him down straight to Sidapa, the goddess of death.\n“Will you smile at me one more time?” said a father to his daughter nearby.\nMark found that he couldn’t move. The memories flashed through his mind of being an innocent, kind, caring child. He was never like this.\nBut time refined him.\nHe walked to the father and daughter and offered them packed food that he had prepared.\nThe father and daughter thanked him and moved onward. They were goblins, but they shared the human quality of thankfulness.\nMark wanted to make sure that everyone had a happy life, and on the side, he would engage in all sorts of murderous conduct to resist his oppressive environment. It was relaxing as being able to fish while reading a book.\nWhen he returned to the city, he noticed a wounded man on the way.\nHe aided him and picked him up.\nThe older man he helped and the woman he convinced gathered together under his flock. He was their shepherd, and now, the wounded man that he helped joined this troupe.\nHe needed fresh troops.\nHe stood and opened his hands, using hundreds of words without lifting a violent finger to get what he wanted.\nSo when the time came, he could fight the battles that words never could.\nSoon, he slashed a human in the face, burning his eyes with lava that he brought in a crucible. He brought it all the way here because he had obtained a magic bag that made storing it easy. The human was particularly hard to kill, having a shield that blocked all his skills and attacks. So this was his last resort.\nThe human screamed, dying under duress.\n[You have received a bountiful reward! +1 Gold Coin +1 Skill Point]\nHe expended this skill point by upgraded one of his skills, the one that allowed to dig into the ground and hide from the goblins earlier. It was called [Dig Straight Down].\nAnd now, it was level 2. It was noticeably faster, but only slightly.\nWhen it came to the names of his group of members, the wounded man that he saved was apparently a gay young man named “Roservelt.” And the fact that he liked men made it easier for him to integrate him, since it was always those who were treated unfairly by society that were the easiest to convince when any semblance of acceptance finally came. The older man, Blanc, was the beggar. The woman was Summune, a member of the faction he had gunned to get into at one point.\nAnyway, he was all alone here after killing the human, who was a traveler. He noticed several other humans coming his way, so he dragged the body into the doom of the darkness of the dungeon and threw him there to be eaten by tendril-controlling wolves. This ensured the true defeat of a particularly nasty enemy.\nHe was the true enemy.\nThe travelers that came next were fast and smart in areas such as navigation and exploration, but they didn’t exactly know when to attack.\nHe immediately grabbed one of his skills [Wheezing Aura] and emitted it toward the travelers.\nThe travelers began coughing.\nMark noticed that one of them was coughing more than normal. The man had asthma, but Mark didn’t know that.\nWith the help of his [System]-sponsored skills, he began a sequence of attacks.\nHe kicked up a dust cloud to obscure vision temporarily, creating confusion and limiting the travelers’ visibility.\nThe travelers retreated a short distance to deny further deterioration over the battle, making sure of the extra space even within a sparse rainforest. But Mark was close enough, tossing a rock within an accurate range.\nThe travelers protected their heads with their arms, but this also lowered their visibility briefly.\nMark was already running, having anticipated this, swinging and striking with his blade.\nHe wasn’t able to scratch them, slap them, or poke them.\nBut he faked a stumble to avoid one of the travelers’ spears.\nHe taunted the opponent, using insults that the older man taught him. And he successfully confused and made the travelers slightly impatient, provoking them to make a hasty decision.\nThe travelers expressed this impatience by jump-running forward practically and grabbing at him, using their strong calves to avoid the momentum loss and imbalance.\nMark used [Minor Distraction] this time, and the grip of the travelers became slightly weakened as a result.\nHe also spat at them and blocked them, nudging them, dodging, and parrying. These were all skills.\nHe barely got away from their grips, as their hands presssed tightly on his wrists.\nHe continued to pester them with feints, scratching, slapping, and poking them before bringing his blade to do heavy damage.\nAfter slaying them, he backed off, falling to his knees.\nHe then used up all his other skills hopefully to get the [System] to level them up.\nHere’s the provided list formatted as a markdown table:\nSkill Name Description Paper Cut Inflicts a minor scratch on the opponent with a sheet of paper. Dust Cloud Kick up a small cloud of dust to temporarily obscure vision. Rock Toss Hurl a small pebble at the opponent for minimal damage. Weak Swing Swing your weapon with little force, dealing minimal damage. Feeble Strike Attempt a weak attack that is easily blocked or dodged. Scratch Lightly scratch the opponent with your fingernails. Slap Deliver a weak slap to the opponent’s face. Poke Poke the opponent with your weapon or fingers for minimal damage. Stumble Intentionally trip or stumble, possibly causing the opponent to hesitate. Taunt Insult or mock the opponent, potentially lowering their morale slightly. Slight Push Give the opponent a gentle push, causing minimal disruption. Minor Distraction Create a minor distraction to momentarily divert the opponent’s attention. Feeble Parry Attempt to parry an attack with little skill or strength. Weak Shove Push the opponent weakly in an attempt to create distance. Glancing Blow Deliver a weak strike that barely affects the opponent. Feeble Kick Execute a weak kick aimed at the opponent’s shins or knees. Hair Pull Grab a handful of the opponent’s hair and pull lightly. Spit Spit in the opponent’s direction, more for annoyance than damage. Feeble Thrust Attempt a weak thrust with a weapon, easily countered. Minor Jostle Bump into the opponent lightly, causing minimal disruption. Barely Block Block an attack with minimal skill or strength. Flick Flick a small object (like a pebble) at the opponent for minimal damage. Feeble Grapple Attempt a weak grappling maneuver with little effect. Dishearten Say something discouraging to lower the opponent’s morale slightly. Pinch Pinch the opponent with minimal force. Distracting Whistle Emit a weak whistle to momentarily distract the opponent. Slight Nudge Nudge the opponent with your shoulder or elbow. Weak Charge Charge at the opponent with minimal speed and force. Feeble Tackle Attempt a weak tackle, easily shrugged off by the opponent. Barely Dodge Dodge an attack with minimal agility or finesse. Wheezing Aura Emit an aura that subtly disrupts the enemy’s breathing, making it harder for them to catch their breath. Dig Straight Down Digging straight down. He had 32 common combat skills that he had gained through hunting humans. Sure, he could hunt monsters, and they were easier to fight. But humans gave tons of XP and skill points, which allowed him to upgrade his skills. Moreover, the [System] rewarded him with these skills in the first place. Though, they were rather weak compared to the skills he had seen. The good thing was that he only fought people with weaker skills. The [System] offered him an ability called [Identity] that allowed him to look at fellow humans’ status page and see their levels, skills, spells, and titles. So he naturally avoided fighting stronger enemies due to this. He had looked very, very cunning to the point as if he predicted whether or not he could kill them or not, but he was just exploiting what was already available to him. And not everyone could see the [System] as he did and use [Identify] here. So that was his secret power.\nChapter 12 - Confrontation and Consolidation link Author’s Note\nIf you want an unapologetic author’s note:\nFor future readers who complain that it’s too fast-paced, I don’t like fillers and padding the story with dialogue and slice-of-life scenes. I prefer a very fast-paced, plot-oriented story moving forward, so most dialogue and slower slice-of-life scenes will be strongly tied to the plot. And If you want a slower story, this might not be for you. Still, It is character-driven in a sense, so don’t expect the main character to kill every single character in sight. He will kill a lot though, so be excited for that. He also will not have a redemption arc. He does good things, but please don’t mistake it for kindness or goodness in his heart. He can experience love and emotions, but he isn’t a savior in the true sense. He will kill and discard and dispose of the kindest of individuals, and he will turn close friendships upside-down. He doesn’t hate for the most part, but when he does, expect it to be calm and calculated. The first ## Chapters showed him at his worst: expect to see him at his best time and time again. This world is hatching a plan to destroy him, but he is relentless, unyielding, and defiant. He genuinely believes he is being oppressed, so believe that he will do something about it.\nSoon, he used all his skills in sequence again. He treaded the path between monster and human when he began smiling and engaging in casual conversation with a group of traders some time after the fight.\nAll the while, an elf followed him like a child with a mother who liked talking for hours when she encountered an old friend.\nEarlier, he did notice that the two travelers he killed had come with a slave—an elf slave, a woman, beautiful in every category.\nDuring that time, he first picked her up, fed her, quenched her thirst, made her bathe, helped her dress up in clean clothes, and made her feel pretty again by showing her that the world was beautiful and that she was a part of it in a humorous, light-hearted way. It was a simple gesture and cliche, but the hints of Mark’s serious, unyielding, intelligent demeanor validated that a million times over. Moreover, Summune, the only woman in his group, helped in this regard.\nHe wanted to use her, but he needed her to be happy and motivated to improve herself. Coercion was too difficult to maintain, so he cared about her insofar as she benefitted him in the long run, even if she inevitably became free from him.\nBut the elf was traumatized and struggling to make sense of herself and the world, having lost something precious inherent only to her in the process of being enslaved.\nMark knew that he couldn’t save her outright and that the only thing he could do was give her time and space and resources. He had to show her that she could exist even in a world that hated her so badly. She deserved a second chance. And no one could take away her uniqueness.\nThat was specifically what he wanted to exploit—her potential and her uniqueness. He saw the person behind the beauty that invalidated her pain tenfold and that others had used against her. He saw the human being inside that form that she now considered putrid and disgusting because it had “inevitably” brought her great suffering. He saw the soul behind that, and he didn’t need her to satisfy his physical needs. He needed her to be herself and be useful. He knew that the soul made her distinctly useful among thousands of hosts of people, so he wanted to cultivate that.\nUltimately, he would dispose her if needed. He wasn’t compromising. He was adapting.\nMark let her be weak and helpless. He let her be lost, be confused. He let her think, ponder. But he had to remain present, or else she might do something that ruined her own life out of impulsiveness.\nHe expected that she would become useful after years of recovery, but that was the point. He wanted long-term investments. He chose to love her as he would a sibling or a close friend, because that was what a human truly needed—someone to see them as a person because they were flawed. No one was a beautiful elf, a sociopathic murderer, an older beggar, a faction member, or a gay young man. Those facades never encompassed a human’s full identity. Human beings were too complicated to be defined in such an invalidating manner.\nThose was Mark’s eyes amid his sociopathy.\nFurthermore, one could argue that Mark’s actions, while stemming from selfish motivations, could have a net positive outcome for the elf slave.\nAnyway, the traders introduced to him a line of new swords produced thanks to the collaboration between craftsman and traders in the city guild. The dwarves were complicit in this celebrative event.\nBefore buying, he returned to collect money from his workers, including the ladies that he had procured.\nHe was happy to have his money reach the maximum again, since the [System] had limited him only to 50 gold coins. As for whether he could hide it, the [System] was all-knowing and acted instantly.\nIt was the benefit and cons of having such a [System].\nHe gave the 450 coins he couldn’t use to his group, and this was why he was so confident about taking care of the elf woman and taking in his current members.\nNow because he didn’t want those coins being used carelessly, he regulated their usage as an overseer, giving them options to choose and then redirecting them toward more sustainable options. He basically gave them a list of options, and whatever they chose led to another list of options. This way, he could understand their true intentions since most people expected to get the first thing they chose. He did with all 4 members, including the elf woman, and they were all pretty reasonable. Even then, he wasn’t discouraged and planned to keep using this method of verification.\nWhile Mark was walking back to an inn to rest, some guy dressed in purple and yellow clothes emerged and said: “Hey boys, what’s a good day for all of us, today! Huhuhuhu! I haven’t been so glad since the day I was a little poopoo! Isn’t it crazy! I cannot believe it! My entire existence is like molten lava! It burns! It burns! It burns! Tell me! What the hell is happening here!”\nMark cringed. “Who are you?”\nThe guy continued: “I love it when somebody looks at me and says that question! Isn’t it crazy! We’re all here because of a good reason? I don’t know. I just think it’s cool!”\n“What? What? Huh?” Mark, for the first time in his life, met someone like this.\n“Really so cool! Isn’t it!”\n“What are you talking about?” Mark was confused and starting to get a little annoyed.\n“Uh, you know. I’m talking about the fact that you kill people and you get away with it! Hahaha—” He inhaled his laugh.\n“Oh, bullshit.” Mark had killed three travelers even after the city countered him with a skill that provided sight over a large area because he was outside of its range.\nBut the man in front of him knew somehow. To add to that, his eccentric personality or persona only emitted a sense of unpredictability, leaving Mark at a loss for what to do.\nMark couldn’t plan what to do next in this span of time, so he invested his brain energy into dodging or whatever instinctive action immediately needed.\nHowever, soon, things started appearing. First, the sky turned dark, fiery flames bursting in the distance. Second, dark shadows joined hands with fairy creatures, two contrasting elements working in concerrt. Third, horrific sounds hummed, droning rapidly. Fourth, several forms shifted in size, as their shadows went down the surrounding hill. Fourth, the growls of hungry berserkers struck the ground, supernaturally making a temporary smooth path to Mark. Five, roars preceded the appearance of kingly men, who wore elegant, ornate, and gorgeous outfits.\nThese men all had long, dark, flowing hair and facial hair, and they jumped and danced in the air. They had outstretched arms and serene expressions. Their magic were a spiraling mix of colors, lights, patterns, and shapes. Most of them had magic that included flowers and leaves.\nThe first wore a black suit with a colorful, patterned vest and a white shirt. His fists were clenched and his face was determined. His magic carried patterns reminiscient of a cityscape and a cathedral.\nThe second cast magic creating a colorful, patterned background. He wore a blue and white striped shirt, a black vest, and black pants. His right arm was outstretched and his left hand was on his hip. His magic formed a large archway at the center, with a bright light shining through it.\nThe third had a serene expression and wore a blue and purple tunic with gold embroidery, and a brown belt with a large buckle. He had a necklace with a large pendant, and his arms were adorned with bracelets. He held a long, flowing scarf in his hands, which trailed behind him as he danced. His magic had a large, circular design in the center.\nThe fourth wore a white shirt with gold embroidery, brown pants, and a brown sash. His eyes were closed.\nThe fifth wore a long, flowing blue robe with gold embroidery and a red sash. His magic resembled a twisting mix of clouds.\nThe sixth had a bare chest and wore an orange cloth around his waist and a blue sash.\nThe seventh had curly hair and also wore a white shirt that was open at the chest and green and brown pants. He had a brown sash around his waist, and he was holding a rose vine in his hands.\nThe rest were even more diverse in clothing, shape, and demeanor, each member projecting a sense of bountiful purpose and collective destiny. This was their stand-off against the measly sociopath.\nIn conclusion, adventurers emerged all around him.\nThey were too many for Mark to handle.\nHe raised his hands in defeat.\nIf they killed him, this would be bad. Truly, in this rational situation, he chose a fifty-fifty chance of living rather than the 1 percent chance of escaping if he tried to fight now.\nAfter they took him in, he was immediately given the chance to present witnesses on his behalf, choosing the group that he had cultivated.\nThe 2 women and 2 men under his motherhood were quick to defend him.\nAnd he came out very easily. These four varied in terms of background, and they only saw his good sides. As for the only exception, the elf woman had seen him kill the two travelers, but her standards were so low that anyone, including Mark, was a perfect saint compared to her previous owners.\nWhen it came to the evidence, they only had the word of mouth of the adventurer who wore a purple and yellow outfit. Moreover, Mark learned in the trial that his name was Hitchcock from Summune, who said that they were both part of the same faction. This meant he was dealing with the faction that he had planned to join at one point. This situation made Summune’s loyalty to him look strangely devoted and by extension, unclear, so he kept an eye on her to see what she would do next, since engaging her directly would likely disrupt his more important objectives.\nMark was released into the wild, his flock reinforced in strength by this event. He himself too had learned new things about this world.\nOne thing he realized was how easy it was to get away with doing horrible things when one had enough money and power to do so, especially when the electorate was informed on abuses and exploitations conducted against the lower class. Many travelers that he killed were lower class folks, not powerful creatures of immense power. That was how he was able to get away with it.\nBut he was sorry. He was so, so sorry.\nTo make up for it, he was planning to overthrow the local government and consolidate political power. And he needed the support of the lower class, which was why he began wearing a purple and yellow outfit, which was a typical working-class attire.\nHowever, in order to do that, he needed to keep his current “rank” within society. And currently, it was very low and decaying overtime the more he tended to other important matters.\nMoreover, he had to begin working with adventurers.\nBut first, he would move to the various towns around the city in order to gain support. But this had to start slowly and with the initial goal of testing.\nHis end goal would involve an organized mass demonstration and coup d’état, because he couldn’t just walk up and tear it all down on its own. The thousands of adventurers hiding their strength behind the walls of the streets and in the shadows of dungeons, castle walls, caves, and strategic locations had to be baited out of their hiding place.\nIn response to the adventurers having ganged up on him, he would be fighting fire with fire, or organization with organization.\nSo he had to stand out, moving from individual survival and accumulation of power to a larger, more systemic bid for control.\nSince he was confirmed an adventurer after he registered one or two days ago, he began heading to the remote towns, making up reasons such as monster hunting. As mentioned before, it was the bandit lord that had made him register, and his current situation with him was that he needed to keep bringing him gold and skills. That was why 70 percent of the 450 gold coins was relinquished to the bandits.\nAnyway, he wouldn’t be bringing his group, but he had to be careful lest the adventurers ambushed him like he did to many travelers and adventurers.\nSo what he did was work with the goblins to safeguard his passage, offering them the heads of the last three people he had killed as a sign of their continuing friendship. He passed by the fishing town again, saying hi to a familiar father and daughter. Their new layer of interaction convinced his new goblin companions of his respect, or even good nature, to the goblin species.\nEventually, he arrived at a remote town, with his gang of goblin companions watching out for danger. To expand on their behavior, they acted similar to the bandits he worked with before, but the goblins’ culture differed strikingly, being more given to discipline and formality.\nMeanwhile, near the horizon, several colorazs, or assassin mages, appeared between deep forest groves, squatting efficiently. Their burden was to observe Mark.\nChapter 13 - Fortifying Bonds and Facing Trials linkNow that he was here in the remote town, his first goals were to establish an effective defence against any possible threats. He knew firsthand what happened to villages when their defences were inconsistent.\nSince he was an adventurer, he inserted himself into the village as an adventurer, showing the goblins as an implicit show of force that he was capable of protecting them. But it also meant that it would be a good idea to listen to him while he was on their side.\nHe suggested various defence strategies, but he mainly kept his focus on monsters, assessing various locations and spots for the risk of monsters passing through and gaining control of vantage points and other strategic locations surrounding the village.\nHis past experience of identifying possible ways to infiltrate his first former now-destroyed village was crucial here.\nHe got the aid of various eyes, asking the goblins for their advice on how to keep this town secure.\nIt was a strange situation, since the goblins’ interests lay in killing humans. However, they would let go of townsfolk if that meant killing human adventurers first and foremost. It could be considered idealistic to consider townsfolk separate from adventurers enough to spare them from harm. But that was their decision.\nUltimately, the goblins did agree to help Mark, leaving him relieved. It was great having connections pay off. He couldn’t say the same for the people who had made connections out of him.\nThe goblins suggested various vulnerabilities that needed addressing; however, they also noted the assessments given by the townsfolk themselves, those relaying their limited resources.\nMark knew that in order for the town to utilize their resources fully. He had to be a lot more heavy-handed, which meant imposing systematic demands from a much less organized group compared to the city.\nMoreover, he still had little to zero reputation, so even if the town was not that big, only numbering around 10,000 people, he was still expected to engage in dungeon quests nearby as an adventurer.\nSo he got to work.\nHe entered his first labyrinth, adjusting his posture in the presence of the goblins so as not to offend them. As for the reason of this, he had begun mimicking the posture and style of fighting of the adventurers, which made it awkward now that the goblins, who had a lethal bone to pick against adventurers, were involved.\nThe goblins didn’t want to leave just yet either, especially after he sought advice from them.\nIt became clear that Mark’s position here—no matter how more solipsistically strategic taking immediate control of the town was—would revolve around these goblins’ facilitation. They were essential components of a key strategy that he could extrapolate toward greater heights of power—one that considered the strengths of monsters and humans under one collective mark.\nBut he had to be careful.\nReturning to the moment, the labyrinth was full of different rooms each representing various challenges he and many adventurers had to undertake. Since he was new here, he expected to take on at least once a day for the next week or so to start. The default requirement was actually only once a week; however, it became more and more common for adventurers to have this sprint of a start due to precedents set by genius adventurers.\nHis first room involved a bow and enemies coming in waves. Moreover, the [System] prevented Mark and the goblins from using skills for the duration of their defence in the room.\nThe goblins were well-aware of the mechanics involved with a bow and arrow and what one had to do to operate efficiently.\nBut Mark’s bow prowess had always been a supplement to his skills, strong villager calves, and blade-wielding quickness. But he was skilled.\nIn the end, he had to fade into the background in order to deliver shots effectively, even if it meant putting the goblins on the spotlight. The goblins manned up as well; reciting their oath to protect him and stating that this was part of the job.\nHe nodded, finding their way of saying it hilarious. Even now, he still had that sense of humor that he had gotten from Markus.\nWhen the fight began, he immediately covered his head with his arms in case the room had surprises for him in the form of projectiles. But he was fine. The goblins also did the same anyway, but soon enough, they had to uncover their vision to track the opponents that emerged. These opponents were cat-sized slimes, spiders, and ants.\nThe bow was enough to penetrate them and even kill them in two hits.\n[Cat-sized Spider defeated! +5 XP gained.]\nThe goblins were killing a lot too.\n[Cat-sized Slime defeated! +6 XP gained.]\n[Cat-sized Slime defeated! +6 XP gained.]\n[Cat-sized Slime defeated! +6 XP gained.]\n[Cat-sized Ant defeated! +4 XP gained.]\n[Cat-sized Ant defeated! +4 XP gained.]\nSo Mark kept shooting, pausing between shots to move sideways in order to keep omnidirectional vision of the room. He knew the goblins were going to be playing independently as well, seeing how the room’s floor tiles were shifting magically and randomly. It made balancing a challenge, as two feet could be on two different tiles headed in two contrasting rectilinear motions.\nBut Mark was off the list of fast deaths, as his calves had been dependable since childhood.\nAfter sweeping the room of the opponents, Mark fell to the ground, having aching calves. He needed a break after avoiding so much attacks. It was the first wave, so he hadn’t completely adapted just yet to the way the opponents moved each. But his past experience with humans supplied him with just enough know-how to use the goblins as a guide and extrapolate key info.\nHowever, after 5 waves of relentless onslaught, Mark was surprised to see that the room was still going. For the sixth wave, it had a surprise boss at the start of the wave: a group of skeleton archers accompaned by a few slimes.\n[Cat-sized Slime defeated! +6 XP gained.]\n[Cat-sized Slime defeated! +6 XP gained.]\nThe skeleton archers immediately hit the goblins straight through the armor, their spectral arrows breaking their stride and any momentum.\nThis was dangerous, so Mark pressed the door that led to the exit. Immediately, Mark and the goblins teleported out of the room.\nThis meant that they wouldn’t be getting any loot or rewards; however, it still served as previous experience moving forward for their next attempts at defeating the waves and uncovering the treasure hidden within.\nWhen Mark returned to the town, he was quickly given several warnings by the guild not to engage the room without registering as an adventurer there.\nMark was surprised. It was a common practice for adventurer IDs to work throughout the region. But this town was particularly against letting any adventurer take on a room without signing up first. He was told to sign up, but he didn’t think they meant to sign up again but locally for this town and its adventurer guild.\nThis was tricky as well, since he never mentioned the guild to the goblins. They probably knew about it, but the guild here was not that well-known. So they might not see it too much as a threat.\nBut if Mark entered the guild and it was blooming and showing great potential, his relationship with the goblins would be a lot tricker. But if they left, he knew that as long as delivered fresh human heads, that would be enough proof that goblins could soon infiltrate human borders. But for now, they were silent. The humans were too interconnected, and they had many powerful allies. If the goblins dared step out of their territory instead of defending only, then the humans would not respond so well to that.\nThis was a battle of tensions, and no one wanted to strike first. They needed a justification, so it was a tense standoff that meant a lot for Mark moving forward. The humans could strike only up to a certain degree, and all the battles were limited to skirmishes. It was a standoff in broader proportions, but in the details, it was hectic. And Mark was in those details. Wiggle room with respect to the conflict was growing thinner and thinner, and they might need a spark like Mark to blast everything out of the water.\nHowever, Mark was more concerned with single-person matters, having temporarily let go of much of his influence and power back at the city. Now that he was here, it was a refuge, a place to address common goals and ideas and interpose chain links between different levels of strategy and action—a reflective stage where isolated ideas each generated in a vacuum were brought to light and married together within a singular-minded capacity.\nThis was not actually how he saw it. He saw it as taking a break merely; however, he felt strongly in his heart that this was pivotal.\nOnce he got his adventurer licence, he went down to the next room.\nThere, the goblins were absent, but he was here with a passing adventurer party that only wanted to test him. They even brought candles to place next to his face to see if he was scared. It was petty, but they didn’t seem too ill-intentioned. It felt more like a bunch of children not knowing how to approach strangers politely and sociably than anything. Mark knew that the best way to be polite and sociable was to be mostly quiet, especially if he didn’t know what was going on, and the urban city gave him many opportunies to do this, given he had lived almost all his life in a rural village.\nWhen he and the party entered the second room, Mark was asked to cast all his skills to demonstrate his prowess. They pointed out an army of doors and other wooden objects blocking their path and encouraged him.\nMark cast several skills, breaking open various doors. It was getting difficult to navigate this dungeon, as it had a giant creature roaming around that was difficult for them to kill quickly. If the adventurers were alone, they would kill the creature, but since the creature targeted the weakest one first with a long range skill and couldn’t miss with this skill, the adventurers had to play around positioning with the doors that emerged and blocked their path every so often around the labyrinth-like room.\nWhen they finally escaped, the creature was still running after them. This time, however, Mark was able to show his bow skills, giving the creature pause by hitting it in the head.\nThe creature regenerated its flesh, the new flesh pushing out Mark’s arrow.\nBut Mark shot again, using his two first skills [Redburst] and [Cold Gaze], the ones not included in his common skills and that he rarely got to use due to their long cooldowns. He used them here since they were available again.\nIf Mark could work at this pace, then handling authorities that seemed like gods compared to the elders of his first village would be a tiny bit easier.\n[Level 7: Mark Reader\nHealth: 710/710\nMana: 350/350\nArmor: 62\nMagic Resistance: 34\nSkills: Redburst; Cold Gaze]\n[To enhance clarity, common skills were omitted for brevity’s sake.]\nChapter 14 - The Dream-Maker linkEventually, Mark returned to the village, but he only had so much time to spend before the Bandit Lord called him with his colorazs.\nWhile traveling back home, Mark contained himself from stabbing a traveler. His impulses had become refined with combat sophistication. Basically, the better he got, the harder it was to hide it.\nHis heart burned in his chest for release. He had to invert a human being.\nBut he was among tense goblins and human colarazs. If he dared show violence, even toward a traveler, that might trigger them to unleash their fervor at each other’s necks.\nWhen they finally returned, Mark fell to a drowsy phase, his back against the wall, his heart pounding in his chest. The night sky bleated at him like a goat, inspiring him to rise from the ashes of his former two villages and become a queen-god.\nHe needed only a blade strong enough to pierce through a lion’s neck; then, his heart would jump at the opportunity.\nBasically, he only needed the weapons of war; then, his heart would follow through.\nHe would not let himself be wielded as a tool.\nHe would try again and try harder.\nHis introspection came to an end, his mind stolen into a dream.\nThe sky fell down, and his heart leaped many steps backwards.\nA nightmare flew around him and throughout, casting chains upon his wrists and the ankles, striking him down with a long bouncing heavenly sword.\nHe saw that the dream was particularly vivid and lucidly composed himself.\nA dream-maker had appeared, expressing his deep admiration for his ability to navigate an otherwise terrifying dream.\nBut Mark was not impressed. He was scared of letting his murderous intents slip, so he castrated himself with a cognitive push to the abyss of his heart where only he himself could appear. It was a mental spot in his mind that no one could enter.\nBut the dream-maker was persistent, revealing new skills with which he struck the mark on Mark’s head—representing a teardrop, the tears of blood he spilled all day long.\nThe dream-maker grabbed Mark’s arm and ripped it off, roaring at the Mark and making sure that his existence was under his might and power.\nHe created towers and castles in this imaginary place, but they were as physically tortorous as though it were real. He threw it with only his mind.\nMark’s form disappeared, as the limbs, joints, and outlines that made him up became blurred in tortorous composite. The castles and the towers made him their bitch.\nMark’s body was let go: what was supple flesh was now mud and blood.\nMark recreated himself.\nAnd the dream-maker, despite his extensive experience, didn’t realize that Mark’s power was growing as his lucidity bloomed.\nMark struck down the dream-maker, making his eyes burn with blood. He struck him again and again. And on the night that Mark awoke, he saw blood all over his clothes. The dream-maker was nowhere to be seen, for he was now in a dream of his own, in non-existence, and in a place untouchable by anyone else. His death midway through his nightmare target spell became horrific.\nMark stretched his neck like a giraffe, indicating that his urges were filled and his heart was light.\nThe pain from a lack of release was removed. Now, he could kill again with less impulsivity and greater control.\nThat was the life-sucking nature of his operation—the more he killed, the more his soul thirsted for blood. It was a consequence of this life that he had chosen. But it was his goal and his destiny.\nWhatever magical creature or man carrying spells untold came his way, he could only sit and unleash the greatness which his life had bestowed upon him—that of murder, that of grace, that of a hundred swords lashing at the back.\nHe was a murderer, sociopathic.\nSince he was half-asleep, he cast the blade again, striking the still-living dream-maker partially. The dream that the dream-maker has cast upon him was now his prison, and Mark could now do anything he wanted there until he was awake again.\nBut for the time, the torture was here-to-do.\nThe dream-maker screamed, his piercing screeches becoming a song as old as time.\nMark released himself from the dream and from his drowsy state. He was elevated beyond a simple man, as he could render a magical man to a simple self-tortored soul. This was his simple action.\nThe dream-maker’s continuous “losing” within his dream became a source of XP for Mark, adding up to his overall control over the narrative spoken by the city authority. Whether or not this dream-maker represented a new shift in the priorities of the city and its citizens with respect to a new stage, he held the crystal ball in his hand.\nEventually, Mark revealed himself to Summune, his hands surrounded by magical particles emitting his increased incense. This incense was a smell brought about by the winds of magic. So the more this wondrous incense smelled, the more power he held behind that grip of his. If he let his power loose, the smell fell silent.\nSummune knew this. She also knew that Mark was not a member of her faction, which was initially reason she came to respect him and follow in his footsteps, even to the point of defending him in trial. She had her own agency, so she decided that in order to keep her growth secure, she had to fulfill a need she noted that Mark lacked—potions and alchemy. Since she was secondarily an alchemist, which lay peripheral to her role as a berserker in combat, she made it a point to Mark, interrupting him and placing her discussion about this on the table.\nMark was surprised by her insistence, but he welcomed it, saying that her help would be appreciated. He said that health potions were the most useful. Summune nodded, but she secretly preferred poison potions to keep her enemies out of position and unable to chase. It was the base for her breaking enemy harmony and tempo.\nMark nodded again, demanding that she employed immediately.\nHe went out, relying on her powers to castrate the goblins and keep them on the noose, as the poison could terminate if they intentionally braved the poison storms she had unleashed. It was suicidal to dare against the choking power, and they lost their lives to her poisonous clouds.\nMark was impressed, as he struck thrice three goblins in the face, breaking what was supposed to be their three-pronged armament. They fell to the earth, dead.\nMark leveled up, Summune following alongside.\nMeanwhile, an armored tall goblin emerged, followed by groups of threes.\nMark struck the tall goblin, removing his crown and piercing the soft pads of his armor, threatening him with his great might. He slammed down, cleaning the earth of his kind one at a time.\nThe groups ran, as Summune surrounded them with her poisonous smoke. It didn’t damage herself and those she assigned as allies, making it convenient to choke out the enemy literally, within a tight place.\nMark fell to the earth, as ten goblins crowded him. But he caught himself and slashed omnidirectionally, striking an opening in each direction before attacking in all diagonal cardinal directions, bursting forth in a concentric victory.\nSummune raised her hand, bleeding from her chest. A now-dead goblin had placed an ax on her belly, and a living goblin continued to attack her from behind.\nMark caught her and slashed the goblin face-wise.\nSummune and Mark left the cave, furthering their path toward the next dungeon. They were not in the dungeon with the rooms. It was a regular dungeon, and their goal was to keep an eye out for opportunity and chests. The adventerers usually relied on beginners to scout around before the big boys and girls made their way promptly like a bunch of golden arrogant ducks. It wasn’t that serious, but ’twas was the way their little system worked around here.\nMark relished the opportunity to contribute to a wider network, having contacted the ladies about his contributions, showing off a simpler, more innocent side of him in the face of his big, larger-than-life self that usually appeared in front of these ladies. It was a gambit to secure their trust in the face of the new team managing them. He had to keep his eyes open, because risks were everywhere.\nWhile Mark and Summune trekked to the next dungeon, he continued down the narrow lane, striking any shadow that popped ghastlily. It was the time for tension. If a man like the dream-maker struck again, he would lose his tongue, his greatness summarized, and his will to burn through the ever-lasting presence of death and suffering, his body.\nHe touched his collarbone with thought, recognizing the soul that beaten within him.\nHe had to strike faster than anything seen.\nSummune released her gas clouds, poisoning a crowd of bats obstructing their vision. Mark followed up with a sweeping triple slash, one guided by the desire to remain an omnidirectional presence. It was his habit now formed, and he restrained himself from embracing Summune or going too far from her. He had to keep combat distance to make sure their dynamic remained secure. It was about combat really.\nA bat struck, But Mark was omnipresent, removing it from its place, tossing it aside.\nSummune released her gas clouds in a focused gaze to the ends of the cave, but she left multiple sides vulnerable, which Mark exploited by baiting the bats into tight clumps. “You’re screeching real loud for bats in striking distance!” He struck them multidirectionally, in all four corners of the earth, and proverbially like he was quoting ancient scripture.\nThe bats dissipated into nothing, while Mark positioned himself relatively close to Summune. “What happened back there? You forgot to use it to block out the cave instead. We could have been more careful.”\nSummune nodded, finding that his proximity was strangely comforting but also abnormal. She moved obviously away, as he began taking loot one by one.\nMark didn’t really need to hide it. He wanted to test Summune in order to glimpse into her heart. That controlling her required him to do things he wouldn’t otherwise do made this challenging for the people he was testing. But for him, it was a procedure, a manual expression, a robotic execution.\nThat was how Mark beat the dream-maker—through loving the act and reducing his emotions to a pinpoint that it never became complex or humane whatsoever. It was the exact nature of this telling.\nSummune was awkward again, similar to when they first met. She thought she was being weird. So she began oversharing to reduce the discomfort Mark had injected into the mood and to clarify an otherwise out-of-control situation for her: “You know, like, I actually don’t know, like, what I’m doing. And I.. hehe… feel a little strange that… I don’t know what I’m doing. So… hopefully… we can… do something about that. Ah, yeah, I’m sorry. Just forget what I said, I think.” She began bouncing side to side without thinking, indicating her desire to lighten up the mood and dispell any confusion and taut awkwardness.\nMark was curious, so he leaned back and motioned for both of them to leave, pretending that he himself found the situation awkward as well. This was him doing better since Sophia Strong, who had destroyed his sense of control when she introduced the existence of the [System]. But now, he finally did it and kept his composure all while manipulating and gaining from his target. This was him surpassing the him that fell prey to Sophia’s schemes—an evolution of his spirit.\nSummune smiled nonetheless. The wind would blow happily whatever lay behind the smile Mark shared with her.\n[Level 8: Mark Reader\nHealth: 730/730\nMana: 390/390\nArmor: 64\nMagic Resistance: 35\nSkills: Redburst; Cold Gaze]\n[To enhance clarity, common skills were omitted for brevity’s sake.]\nBut Summune was a berserker, and she had never established that to Mark.\nChapter 15 - Boiling Intensity linkEarlier, when he killed the dream-maker, Mark went back and grabbed the dream-maker’s body. He was in his inn-room, so he had to be very careful with bodies.\nBut on that day, he had proof that the dream-maker was an enemy when he was inspected by a guilt-keeper, a role within the policing force in the town.\nAs for how this happened, the guilt-keeper came into his inn room with a flirtatious smile, being a straight woman.\nIn contrast, even if she was more within his expectations compared to Roservelt, the only gay member of his little group, Mark was disinterested; only concerned with the possible consequences of being targeted like this.\nFurthermore, if the guilt-keeper diverged from what was expected from her role, then that would be problematic for him, as he wanted to keep his shoulders clean of complicit hands. If he had to kill her, he would, but cleaning up would be troublesome, like having a village feast in the middle of the night and then having to clean it all up in the morning. That was why back then, his first village would do it very early in the morning before sunrise when people still had energy to think and clean.\n“What’s next?” she said, carrying heavy sadness on her back. She had been adjusting her steps, avoiding the line gaps in between the tiles. “I know you killed those people, so what are you going to do next?”\nMark sighed visibly. “Okay, what do you want?” He didn’t want a repeat of that adventurer confrontation.\nThe guilt-keeper demanded: “I want to see how long you can handle being in a room. Can we do that? If you do that for five days, I’ll let you go.”\n“What makes you so sure that I’ll just let you do that?”\n“Well, I could always tell the adventuers again.”\n“And if you don’t have proof?”\n“Well, I do… actually.” She expended her mana to cast a skill that showed a symbol representing evidence of his acts of violence.\nMark chuckled. “I’ve seen many of you do the same thing for animal killers.”\n“Oh, wow. You don’t know that it only detects humans then?”\n“No, I knew. I just meant that animals turned into humans are counted then.”\nThe guilt-keeper paused. “W-what do you mean? There are no animals that can turn into humans—”\n“But there are humans that can turn animals into humans as well. You’ve seen beastmen.”\n“B-beastmen? That’s how they are normally.”\n“Are you sure?” One of the things about this culture was that they hated beastmen to the point that they made it a “fact” that all beastmen were originally just animals. And beastmen were somehow counted in the detector, so that made things complicated.\n“Fuck, then, how can I make you give up?”\n“What? Why are you saying that out loud?”\n“No, I just need a way to fool someone into thinking that they have nowhere to run. I was hoping to get some points, because the more I got people arrested, the more points I got. It’s a fair system for me, because I’ve been able to make some fast money by just arresting anyone I saw that had the red. I knew that it wasn’t reliable, but no one faulted me for it, okay? It’s not my fault!”\nMark sighed genuinely this time. “Okay, whatever. If you sign this contract, I’ll help you.” He handed her a contract.\nShe looked for a moment before asking, “What the hell is this?”\nMark raised his brow. “What?”\n“Why is it saying that you’ll be my slave?”\n“Okay, I gave you the wrong one.”\n“Here.” He handed her a contract that made them collaborators, so that she couldn’t do anything against him and he couldn’t do anything against her. If he was doing something with the intention of hurting or killing her, then she would be alerted. And vice-versa.\nTo explain how the guilt-keeper lost, her evidence was shaky and was simple trying to bluff and intimidate Mark, like a lot of police officers tended to do. She was overplaying her hand, hoping to scare Mark into compliance, rather than having a truly airtight case. This was why she acquiesced relatively easily to Mark’s counter-proposal once he called her bluff. When it came to Mark’s side on this, he knew this, tacitly threatening a court case, considering he had survived a court case previously thanks to his close allies.\nAnyway, Mark was doing this because he wanted to know where the dream-maker came from, and if an ally in the peace-keeping force here made that happen, he would take that opportunity.\nThis might take a hundred years to complete, but he was willing to undertake this series of steps, whatever it took.\nThe guild-keeper was now in his metaphorical right pocket, while the ladies, the team managing them, his current accompanying group, Reeda, and the various connections he had made were in his left one.\nMeanwhile, a man staring at the horizon ran, crushing trolls by the chin and rolling goblins up and smashing them. He used baking equipment to slash through them. He was the self-proclaimed Butcher, his butcher knives spinning in his delicate hands.\nHe hated adventurers, but he was one.\nHe wanted to drag adventurers down one by one into their doom, which was why as a beginner, he trained his combat skills and ability to make connections, dropping his knives frequently when he spun them. He was on a similar journey to Mark, so if they ever butted hands, it would be a handshake.\nHe grabbed the faces of goblins and ripped them apart, slicing them off cleanly before crashing to the ground. The goblins beginning to pile on him, he pushed them off and retreated, healing himself fast with potions. He was still learning how to fight.\nSeeing Mark, he noticed that Mark wore an adventurer’s outfit confidently, as if he was about to kill hundreds upon hundreds of goblins. His eyes reddened, but he kept his impulse in control. He then asked, “Do you know where the bathroom is?”\nMark recognized this technique and said: “I don’t know, sorry.” The man could have been just asking for no reason, but anybody that asked like this straight out of the open potentially had an agenda. It was a cynical scenario, but it was how he operated as well, being wary of people like him.\nThe Butcher then said: “Okay then. Excuse me.” His outfit was messy, but it revealed ambition and recklessness, with blood still staining some parts of his clothes, barely cleaned. His mind was so self-contained.\nMark watched him leave, wondering how many more people were like him.\nHe went into a dungeon and noticed a group of adventurers there telling him to back off.\nHe was being pushed away by a group of adventurers, and he could just kill them.\nBut since they immediately distrusted him, a violent option warranted caution.\nHe left, being forced out of his own forte for the first time. He never had any physical territory to work with, but he did have fortes. When it came to territory, he just borrowed and rented and operated within the organizational processes overlying him.\nMeanwhile, the Butcher came into contact with four groups of adventurers, having four options to choose for a long quest. But none of them accepted him, frustrating him.\nSeveral other adventurers who excelled in support roles faired better and got immediate acceptance rates.\nReturning to Mark, he began to notice a trend in the adventurer guild, having been a part of the bandit organization. None of the adventurers that did well in the guild were secretly bandits, and often times, the bandits wearing the adventurer mask were “sweepers” or bottom-barrel chewers. If he dared put himself at a higher role, he would be neutering his role as a bandit, because power required a hierarchy. If he dared speak out or take actions unfit for the role assigned to him, he would be killed, or hunted down, which was worse because that denoted an organized attempt to dismantle him and his assets, including the ladies and such.\nHe had to be nail-bitingly serene.\nAll the while, within Mark’s left pocket, Summune and the rest of her group began working in small-time quests, as requested by Mark. Mark supported them by paying them each a fixed rate, but he made sure that it wasn’t just money. He often used food gifts and souvenirs to make it more personal, making it easier for him to skip paying them from time to time by asking nicely.\nAt the same time, Butcher chased a scout goblin, wearing him down by smacking him and then grabbing him from a tree, kicking him and tying him up to the tree, smack-playing with his weakened, still body. He hated goblins, not because he hated them, but because they were objects upon which he displaced his rage toward adventurers. He hated this role, and he wanted to rid all of it from his eyes.\nEvery image of torture was him displacing an ounce of his rage.\nBut he would it all over again, because that fountation of anger never faded.\nReturning to Mark, he agreed with Summune to begin having regular meetings with allies at a nearby cafe, because the last events had left him in a state of unfulfilled communication. He had lots of experiences and knowledge now, but none of them were being incorporated into a larger system of networks and loyal allies.\nSummune was the one who suggested it too, so he trusted her to do the talking for now, even if he mind-gamed with her when they first met.\nMeanwhile, the guilt-keeper was blocked and executed after she was discovered to be colluding with someone.\nMark could only accept reality, closing his eyes. “I’m inches away from being discovered.”\nHe had to bite that fingernail harder.\nIn the meantime, the Butcher slashed before he was slashed and murdered immediately by a gang of goblins, whose actions mirrored the bandits of which Mark was a part. He could only survive so long before his arrogance got the better of him.\nTo elucidate this further, if he was humble and took on a support role to integrate into a team because that was the current demand, he would have lived a longer life and even succeeded enough to make his own party with him as the playmaker. Without allies and with only enemies, his self-sufficiency could only fair well so long, as even the blacksmiths who repaired his equipment, items, tools, and weapons and the cooks he made his food didn’t give him discounts due to his confrontational, uncompromising nature and sometimes even increased the price when they heard he was coming to their shop. They wanted him out, gossiping about his nature as a bully who sought power but didn’t recognize the empathy-, kindness-, and loyalty-building charisma required to achieve it.\nHumility was a common theme for bottom-lickers.\nThe successful were lucky and survived due to their great luck and opportunities handed to them on a silver platter, enabling them the gift of arrogance, complacency, and even imposter syndrome.\nAnd Mark was not a part of any of that.\nZooming into the moment, his sweat travelled. It first dripped down his head, touched his chin, dripped down his neck, crossed the slopes of his collar bone, slid down the sides of his belly, dewed his legs, and finally rested upon his skin.\nMark knew exactly what to do, but the problems later came piling up on him.\nTo begin the list, he learned secretly that when things went wrong in the group’s quests, Summune deflected blame and responsibility to the older man, Blanc, and tasked Roosevelt’s adventurer skill to do her menial faction work. She was controlling them like two puppets.\nMoreover, he came to find out that the ladies were being thrown out of places due to their affiliation with a particular member of their new managing team. This meant problems left unaddressed during Mark’s hiring now appearing in a strong way.\nThe ladies themselves were also being pushed so much to entertain in places with much fewer people, resulting in them being pushed and stressed even more. They needed a break, indicating a large drop in Mark’s resources.\nFourth, he heard that Reeda was being forced out of his home due to having been outside of the city for longer than 3 months. This came up late, which confused Reeda that he promptly informed Mark.\nFifth, he came to learn that Markus and his family was being removed from his church due to the cleric’s attempt at sexually blackmailing his wife.\nSixth, the bandit lord wanted things to happen already, having gotten wind of his many activities, which began when one of the bandits saw him at his previous court case. This placed Mark in a do-or-die position.\nSeventh, the dream-maker and the guilt-keeper’s deaths could mean that an official’s lackeys or the police force would come finding him.\nLastly, Richard and everyone he knew were still alive, and he had witnessed Mark firsthand try to kill him.\nMark’s eyes were clear through it all: the power he had built on deception could collapse at any moment.\nA grin that hailed back when he was still struggling to contain his guilt emerged. He loved the silence of absolute chaos.\nHe got up and headed to a cave first, letting the problems simmer while he prepared his fist for the boiling intensity.\nChapter 16 - Summune Shall Become Rosie linkMark came out of the cave, his body clean of blood, his weapons carrying greater understanding, his hands now readied and prepared to receive the burning.\nHe went to Summune, who said she would be at a remote dungeon, but he was immediately faced by a group of armed men straight from the faction to which she belonged. They sought to control him.\nSummune was the ringleader of it all.\nMark grinned, laughing, as he ran.\nSummune used her poisonous smoke to entrap him. They wanted to entrap him legally as well, so they were hoping to capture him and then have him admit affiliation with the bandits with entrapment as a threat. They needed him alive and outside of prison.\nThe factions were on his tail.\nMark struggled against this entrapment, wielding his blade with a distinct flavor or intensity.\nHe struck them once before blocking several attacks, catching a hit from a magical spell.\nAs he cast his own skills, he began punishing them again and again, tossing them aside as he ruptured their flesh and integrity of spirit.\nHe crushed their momentum. Each time they stepped forward, he destroyed them until they fell to the ground naked, their armor torn to shreds.\nHe grabbed each of them and lay them against the wall. “What the hell were you guys planning on doing? Seriously, all you guys needed to do was listen and be careful. Why did you guys do this? Who sent you? Whoever send you is doing a bad job, seriously! I should have been the one who took care for you. I would’ve done a better job. Isn’t it annoying to see people try so hard but rely on faulty methods? Do you want power and success? This is not it. I have spent so long improving my fighting skills and becoming powerful, yet you guys are babies compared to me! It doesn’t make sense. I expected better to be honest. Damn, come here…”\nThe faction members glanced at each other, not budging even slightly.\nMark emphasized, “Come here!”\nThe faction members huddled up next to him.\n“Now if you guys—”\nOne of the faction members raised his hand as if to strike him.\nMark punched him and beat him to a pulp. “Whatever you’re doing, do it subtly. Don’t make it so obvious. If you’re asking a question, just say so. Stop with this raise-hand bullshit. I need answers. Now, tell me. Who the hell are your senders?”\n“Senders?” said one of them.\n“Superiors! Masters! I need answers! Now!”\nMark continued, murmuring: “Usually I’d just kill you. But this… this is different. I’ve changed.\n“Ugh fine. I’ll just kill one of you for the sake of it!” He struck one of them dead. It was Summune.\nThe rest of the faction members shook with fear.\nMark gasped. “My bad. That was supposed to be someone else. Summune was at least strong enough to trap me. Damn…” He giggled. “Ah, whatever. We’re here now, and I’m excited. Now, tell…. me… What is it like to be in your heads right now? Do you guys like the feeling of being here? If so, then we can continue this all year long if you like. If not, then why don’t we talk… and… do stuff with words? Speak!” He sounded like he wasn’t mad at all.\nMaybe the adrenaline was kicking in in high intensity only now.\nThe faction members wanted to talk, but they didn’t know what to say. Mark made it clear that he could just kill them on the spot.\nMark stopped for a second. “Okay, let’s relax, right? Why don’t we chillax and take our time… nicely? I want all of you to take your time and breathe.” He inhaled through his nose. “Take a deep breath. And…” He exhaled through his mouth. “So if you guys are done taking these breaths, I want all of you to also fix yourself and prepare yourself, because we’re moving… somewhere else. We’re moving to a cave. I want to see how exactly you guys are going to manage. I’ve, I’ve been testing this whole time. And I’m so hyped for the idea that maybe I can do something different, you know? If you guys won’t talk to me, that’s not going to be great, isn’t it? So I need a conver—convo-sation. I need some sense that you guys are going to speak. If you guys don’t speak… well… isn’t that great! I could try out a couple of things I’ve never done!”\n“What… are you gonna do?”\n“I could see if you guys are receptive to getting beaten. Then, we can try if maybe you guys actually care about each other, I could try you and you will be put together and I’m punching or hurting or… torturing… the other to see if you actually, if either of you, actually care. I want to see that, you know?”\n“No…” said one of the faction members softly.\n“Yeah, isn’t it sad? It’s sad. It’s sad, isn’t it? I honestly think it’s sad. But like, I understand also that you guys are incredibly amazing creatures. You think real hard. And I like that… I like that really. So if you guys don’t work with me, I think, I think it’s not gonna be great. I’m not saying that you guys are going to feel like shit. I’m just saying that this is an opportunity and for you and everyone in the world. We’re going to have a… time. I, I, I imagine that one of these days, I’m going to try something new. I’ve never that kind of guy, always in my home in that village, never really went out! Never travelled… really! I’ve always been a indoors kind of person, or in-village. You know what I’m saying?” He spoke in a laughing manner. “I just want to try… Maybe I’m wrong, maybe there’s a mistake here. But here’s the thing. I’m going to make sure that you guys have the best time of your life. And I’m saying best as in best. I’m saying ‘bestest’… because that’s, that’s the best, right?” He was smiling.\nThe faction members were stuck. They had no information to share really, and their plan had been to kidnap Mark and get information from him.\n“So… why don’t we work together? I’m going to put you into a dungeon, and we’re going to see how long it takes for people to notice. Because it takes a long time, doesn’t it? It’s a missing person, you know. I just want to experience something that just isn’t just the usual. I want you guys to live. I have an idea that people are amazing creatures, and I would love to see everyone gathered together and having the funnest time in the world. You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to put you guys in a dungeon, and I’m going to see how long it takes. I want to experiment. I’m a learner. Look, I get it. I’m playing with people, and that’s kinda scary. But at the same time, I’m also like, ‘Bruh, I just love the idea. I love doing this shit. It’s fun. It’s exciting. I did that because I loved it and not because it was scary. But the scary part was really good. I loved it as well.’ But I do, I do care. I do care a lot about all of you, about the people. I’m here because of people! People matter to me. And I know it sounds wrong, but don’t you think people deserve to have a… something different. They need a chance at experiencing life at its full-est. I want them to get so excited. I’m going to make them excited, and I’m going to make sure they care.\n“So with my thing finished, I will put you in right now.” He dragged them to a dungeon where the monsters were and tossed them in.\nThe monsters began to tear them apart.\nHe suddenly calmed down, since he still had two faction members left. “Look, I don’t want to hurt you. I’m doing this because I just can’t help myself. I’m not sorry. And I’m also not happy I’m doing this. I shouldn’t be doing this. This is wrong, but it’s also right because it allows me to express myself. I love doing this shit, you know…. man? I love this shit.” He tossed one of the two into the dungeon, as they screamed as they were torn apart.\n“I can’t help myself. It’s something I have to do. It is essential to my being. I am a sociopathic murderer, and I feel guilt all the time. I try to remove it, but it never goes away. That feeling of both excruciating pain that I have to beat so hard out of myself and that excruciating urge, the love of God in that urge, the sense that this is life in that urge. I have to do it. I have to do this.” His voice lowered to a whisper. “I have completely done it all, and no matter how hard I try to plan and make sense, I come back to this.” He took on a sarcastic, mocking tone. “This is exciting. This is funny, isn’t it? It’s funny, right?”\nThe last faction member was not thrown in.\n“I will prepare you for something better,” Mark said.\nThe last faction member was a woman named “Rosie.”\nRosie said: “Why? Why not my friends? Why not the people that I trusted? Why not the people that I gave my life for? Why not the world? Why? Why this disgusting filth of a person? Why… could it be? Why me?”\nMark said: “Come on. Seriously. We need you to get things done. So get things done.”\nThat triggered a core aspect of Rosie, who relied on obeying orders within something bigger than herself to stay afloat and sane.\nThe elf slave woman part of Mark’s group found it awkward when she saw Mark asking her to let Rosie to stay with her in the meantime. This was a weird decision, one with numerous implications. What if Rosie killed the elf slave woman? How could Mark be so sure that the elf slave woman and Rosie would collaborate? What if Rosie just escaped and reported Mark to the faction?\nMark knew these questions, but he made it so anyway because he was pressured. He had other demands. It was not the end of his journey.\nShifting to an omniscient perspective, he had never shown this level of excitement, playfulness, enjoyment, and childlike curiosity with anything, especially violence. He had shown emotions such as guilt in earlier events, but it never really ruined him to the point of nothing. He was still able to operate effectively and kill many, many people. But to become like this meant that his new state of power has made him a lot more comfortable and validated. So it already grew from there to take on forms such as childlike excitement.\nMaybe, it was the newfound power combined with the sudden threat of issues converging on him that it suddenly manifested as this manic glee; maybe a coping mechanism to deal with traumatic stress that could propel him back to the village where all his problems began. His first village where he grew up did traumatize him.\nLiterally hitting himself to expel his guilt and grinning and becoming hysterical and very impulsive were his last-resort attempts at coping with his cognitive dissonances: his pivotal event of attacking Richard after one year of living an innocuous life was one extreme past example of what happened if those dissonances were left to simmer for far too long. The end goal of his unconscious was becoming a single, cohesive identity, something impossible to achieve with all the new pressures he felt compelled to tackle as a segment of his personality.\nRosie was his new object, a tool to be utilized within his framework of insanity.\nThe next problem would confront him—[The Bandit Lord].\nHe wet his blade with water, knowing it would only dull it if he left it wet. They called him mad: true beauty lay in imperfection! He would clumsily ruin this whole organization.\nChapter 17 - Dealing with Something Beyond Him linkEven though he had lots in hand, Mark continued down the route of gathering information and training his fundamentals of combat.\nSlowed down his pace as he moved from spot to spot with a wary gaze, he shot.\nThe shot missed.\nLater, after hiding for a while in one spot, he spotted his goblin target running past the trees again, readying his bow.\nHe shot it down.\nHe recalled his battle with Summune and his acquisition of Rosie, who was currently here with a leaf over her head. The leaf was one of the skills provided by the elf slave, which guaranteed cover from the rain.\nAnyway, his victory over Summune had been carried out with intensity, but it did have many areas of improvement that he had to correct before he fought the bandit lord.\nEven if he himself was a conquerer and killer of adventurers and travelers, he didn’t consider himself a big bad boss.\nHe was just a regular guy committing acts of violence on a regular basis like everyone else. It was a monster-killing world.\nHe shot several more shots, dispatching three goblins back-to-back.\nThe goblin tribe he was targetting were beginning to despise him.\nAfter he relaxed and finished up, he left, keeping in mind the people looking for him.\nThese were the people investigating around because of the dream-maker’s death and the guilt-keeper’s betrayal. They didn’t know who, so he had to keep his head low. Killing basic goblins was a neat, practical way to do that.\nAs part of his bandit duties, he immediately headed to a place where a boss was shining its blades. Similar to the appearance of a spider, the boss possessed a repulsive bulk covered in damp, abnormal growths, reminiscent of fur and scabs. It was equipped with venomous fangs and massive legs, which it employed to haul its corrupted form.\nThe bandits had gathered in various groups all around for a coalition, planning on defeating the boss.\nTheir first layer of battle started with shooting from the trees.\nThe boss takedown began.\nIn background, some moments later, Mark was tasked with a team to shed and poke some of the flanks of the boss’ forces. He did this by slicing and dicing its underlings and spawnlings.\nFirst, giant goblin-like creatures called “Thralls” moved about with spider-like appendages sprouting from their upper bodies and arms growing from the side of their legs.\nThey weaved to him effectively, slashing and grabbing his wrist before aiming to cut off his hand.\nBefore the final death throe, Mark removed his hand.\nIt was a close call, but he knew that with everything came a price.\nHe had to leave immediately.\nHe backed off before he could get bitten with poison by a group of smaller creatures called “Sunderlings.” They were 5-foot-tall creatures with giant heads, spider-like limbs, and an ant-like body. Their height paled in comparison to the Thralls, who were about 11 feet tall.\nThis made the situation that much more complicated, but he had a team. That was how he quickly healed and got rolling into the next formation attack.\nIn the meantime, while his attention was scattered, a man, Lowtard, approached Mark after he saw him fight: “Nah you stay right there! You stay right there! You got me all fricked up!” Stay right there for real!’\nMatthew stared at him. The hell?\nOne of the bandits who had helped Mark heal up, Zanny, began threatening Lowtard likewise. “You better shut the hell up talking to me, bull’s pizzle! I’m not playing! I’m looking for Thralls, mutton-headed miscreant!”\nLowtard shouted back: “They with you? They with you?”\n“They with me, guts-griping knave!” Zanny said.\n“Oh!” Lowtard kept his distance.\nZanny continued: “This Thrall positioning! Stop playing with me!”\n“Oh!” Lowtard began apologizing, walking away.\nIn reference to what he was discussing earlier with Mark’s team, Zanny went right back to business: “I love it, I love it. this is the perfect position.” Zanny was only here to give some pointers since Mark was new to this kind of event. Although he gave it politely as if the entire team didn’t know, the rest of the team apart from Mark already knew what to do.\nTo understand Lowtand’s behavior, what he was doing earlier to Mark was “checking.” In other words, his aggressive approach was an attempt to assert dominance and establish hierarchy within the group, especially considering Mark’s status as a newer member, not necessarily because of Mark’s martial performance per se—a matter of “putting him back in his place.”\nAs for why the bandits with which Mark previously interacted didn’t give him such an annoying hard time, bandits relocated to ambush duty were often low-level bandits, as the wilderness was a challenging place to live in. They had been turned so humble and avoidant by the kind of domineering and hierarchy-building interactions within the organization that they didn’t want to emulate the same scenes during ambush waiting hours, making it easier for Mark to transition initially into it.\nReturning to the present, Zanny prepared several different containers for all of them to get food from. He didn’t want to leave them starving, so he had specifically asked to reroute some of the money that would go to him and spend it on buying extra food for the boys and girls.\nMark was paused, wondering if they were going to fight again. Zanny had spoke of the Thrall positioning. But in his head, he had the faintest clue what that could possibly mean.\nHe worried he would have to deal with an onslaught of details specific to this league of bandits that was all organized under differing circumstances, roles, expectations, structures, and leaders.\nIt was going to require a lot of flexibility on his part.\nIf he wanted to continued his blade-striking, dagger-stabbing rampage, he would need to consider this with a cadence of introspection and information-gathering curiosity.\nHe struck deep: “Zanny, what’s going on?”\nZanny looked at him, curious. “Hm? What do you mean?”\nAnother man emerged from behind, “Listen up! We won’t be here for long!” He lowered his voice and lowered his head. “Zan, keep it going. But don’t forget, we’re going to be heading to Askalatt tomorrow.”\nZanny nodded and said, “Oh, yeah! Right, right…” He returned his gaze at Mark’s group. “Okay, everyone, let’s go,” he said calmly.\nAfter walking for a while, they encountered the rest of the bandits fighting the boss. It was a large area, so they could walk around comfortably in the meantime.\nThey headed to one of the dungeons in the area, heading inside and strking down the webs and lush vegetation that blocked their path.\nInside, they got a small chest, which Zanny carried and gave to Mark. “Okay, I’m heading off.” He redirected his focus to the group, except for Mark. “Guys!” That was all he needed to say because the group already knew what to do. Zanny turned his attention to Mark: “Mark, they’ll say what to do, okay?”\nMark was surprised he was getting this much hand-holding.\nEither way, it didn’t matter whether Zanny was going to be of help or not, as long as he got his way and no one attempted to backstab him.\nHe followed the team and engaged the beast, attacking from several fronts. Zanny kept his eye and told them to adjust their position; instead of telling them the overall composition of the fight, he focused on adjusting them with commands from time to time, because he trusted them to understanding micro-scale dynamics at least.\nMark was not really understanding, but he knew intuitive ways to surprise enemies. However, in this fight, he was at a disadvantage.\nHe kept his bow in hand, drawing and shooting quickly, focused on getting the message across that he could fight well. This way, the rest of the team would give him more major positions within the ongoing fight. He was immediately told to step up and replace one of the other members, after he shot three Sunderlings down in twenty seconds. It was hard to hit them, given the very back-and-forth nature of the fight. No one wanted to engage because both sides were dancing back and forth and trying to bait the other into a disadvantageous position.\nMark kept his shots simple and nice, aiming at the bulk of the sunderlings.\nEach time he hit, he got a notification from the [System].\n[Hit +1 XP]\n[Hit +1 XP]\n[Hit +1 XP]\nThe hits were satisfying, and he knew just where to move when the Thralls gathered and tried a charge formation.\nIt was easy to follow along with his team, because the enemies hilariously telegraphed where they would surround next.\nIt was like watching a bunch of birds fly and perch at the same spots in his old village.\nHe kept a straight line, always navigating with the intention of simple movements, because he knew that most of the work was going to be done by the people at the vanguard. They were the ones who needed to be moving diagonally, around, and in a complicated manner. It was him and the others in his position that only needed to keep their movements predicatable for the outer layer or vanguard to match pace easily.\nThe fight went, and soon enough, the Thralls fell. The Sunderlings were long gone, having retreated as soon as they sighted the best Thralls fall. At that point, it was a grind fest, where they slowly shot down and weaved around the Thralls until they died in frustration.\nAfter the fight, they relaxed around a tree. Mark still wanted to know about the boss. “Hey, was the boss strong?” he said, not going too casual or too formal. He wanted to be careful around these fellows, because he didn’t understand the culture around here. He was just relying on his past interactions with regular citizens of the city, so he made mistakes here and there.\nThe team members saw him and grabbed his hand, pulling him to their bodies in a friendly gesture.\n“Good work!” said one of the members, Joshia. “Marvelous. You looked like a little dog when you were fighting!”\nWas that a compliment or what?”\nMark nodded. “Thanks.”\n“That was a joke. You were more than a dog. You were a monster.”\n“Huh. I see. Thanks.”\n“That was incredible… so you were…” Lovosika began stuttering. “m-m-m-m-m-m-making arrows move on their own. It was like they had a soul!”\n“Nah, that was just… shooting.”\n“Really,” said Roksnan. “I was sure it was black magic!”\nLovosika said, “Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah.”\nJoshia said, “Yeah!”\n“I mean, it could be, but I ain’t completely sure,” he said, keeping a casual, playful tone.\n“That’s great. Anyways, let’s go!”\nThey parted ways, but before that, the bandit leaders gathered everyone, including Zanny and Mark’s team.\nMark was watching the team leaders giving generic speeches when he saw a familiar woman—the elf slave. She was a bandit?\nHe looked away and kept his head down. When did he see her? Where was she again? He forgot where she was standing. Right! At the corner of the stall at the right side.\nHe was currently in a field flanked by cliffs, hills, trees, and a wide path that led to the city.\nMark was ashamed of himself for not realizing. But could he know? It was comical how the elf slave ended up being a bandit. It didn’t make sense!\nHe was so bothered that he wanted to be honest for once like he was with Sophia Strong. He was losing his grip, getting sucked into civil pleasures and challenges. Where was the ruthless him, huh? He was not ruthless actually. He did it because he had to learn, but in some ways, yes, he admitted he was “ruthless.” But he didn’t want to admit that 100 percent. He was just abiding by the laws of this world, and if he had to abide by it to get what he achieve what he thought was right, so be it.\nHe hated how out of control this bandit event ended up becoming. He was out of his element, surrounded by people he killed before. But they were not adventurers. They were bandits, and strangely enough, from what he had seen, they were more organized ironically, which left him secretly baffled. He had never seen such organization back in his village. The city was a big place, but he never thought any organization would reach this level of size and structure. He wanted to run off for now, but he would grit his teeth.\nThis would take a while, but he would assimilate into this and slowly earn the skills necessary to replace whatever this aspect of the city was.\nChapter 18 - Damning linkMark slowly read a tome about how adventurers navigated the most horrific dungeons; it looked more fiction than reality given how much praise it gave the adventurers. He put away the book for now, entertaining a visitor.\nOne of the ladies with whom he had began a relationship was surprised to see him so relaxed. “Why are you sitting here? Let’s go! They’re waiting for us.”\nMark smiled before standing up casuall and then adjusting his tunic politely and with an air of patience and composure. He didn’t need to hurry. A hurried life was a fast death.\nOutside the rest of the ladies that he used to manage were hurrying to a small area.\nA man was lying down, laughing and guffawing. Behind him, a goblin lay still against the tree, blood pouring from his chest from an impaling spear.\nThe man was supposed to be one of the new managers. He was the reason the entertainer ladies were being locked out of places.\nHe had suddenly lost his marbles after his parents died.\nIt was tragic, but Mark couldn’t do anything about it. The man was effectively having a mental breakdown, and because he made it so public, Mark noted that it was more like a tantrum if anything, given that the man had been continuing this behavior outside where the ladies’ audience regulars could see.\nMark hated these types, because they reminded him of his father. So he immediately impulsively reached for the man. Before he could touch him, the man shoved him off and growled in anger. He didn’t start fighting Mark, but he also wasn’t letting Mark move him.\nMark realized that he had to call the authorities, so he did. Sooner or later, the tragic man was thrown away. Not a single ounce of help was given to him. but Mark had other plans.\nMark visited him in a jail cell and told him that if he (1) listened to Mark and obeyed his orders, (2) followed the path to Sarsagon, which was a place that had lots of rumors around it, and (3) apologized to the ladies and the regulars publicly, then Mark would use his contacts to help free him.\nThe man agreed, realizing somberly that he didn’t want to be in a jail cell forever.\n[Manipulation skill check! Success! +75 XP]\nMark knew how to use the weaknesses of others against them, especially when they gave up their playing cards just like that. How could he lose against someone so vulnerable?\nHe then freed the man with the help of his most crucial connection, Reeda.\nBecause of this success, he decided to play along with it and asked Reeda about the former villages of the second village to which he had gone.\nReeda said that they were here in the city, but he said he wasn’t sure if they would be so keen to seeing someone that reminded him of the village.\nMark expressed empathy, saying that it was understandable and that he could wait.\nThis was planting a seed on his part. He made himself appear as if he had been in a hurry and was now relinquishing his need to talk to the villagers in a feat of patience and empathy. It was his way of anticipating and preparing for future events.\nSo long as he maintained this attitude, he would be able to maintain calculably high rate percentages of success across his plans and methodologies. This vast landscape of skill was not limited to the status page skills. He was a quick thinker and a strategical juggernaut. Anybody that dared face him would face the man who had slayed his own village in service to a broader plan that covered regions that he had never even visited.\nThis was his ability to think ahead and in abstract terms regarding the unknown realm sutured into his cognition—a masterful feat of skill. More accurately, he was hedging his bets by planting seeds all around with the goal of reducing the likelihood of failure through the mechanism of redundancy, a characteristic he saw in plants growing up in his village. To explain why, many plants had multiple parts that offered the same necessary function to stay alive so that even if one was lost, life went on.\nBy slowing down the pace and setting things up in advance, everything made sense within his larger-thinking mind, which required that he kept along with the fast pace of the city while maintaining a sense of psychological stability through it all. His mind was genius in the fact that he knew how to think beyond the moment. He was the moment, and he was the pre-formed genesis of the aftermath.\nEven without a formal education, he had cognitive intelligence beyond what a dictionary of jargon could provide, something provided by the challenges of living in a world navigated by monsters and the powers that were, in an unforgiving rural environment riddled with diseases and all sorts of problematic tampering by the city, along with the complications with which his village social structure cursed him.\nHe was more than welcome to assuage this world, captivating it and becoming an entertainer.\nHe diligently paid attention to his body, offering moments of exercise and nutritional thought. He knew nutrition even without the term “nutrition”. He recognized that his body was a slave to the organic fabrics making up this planet.\nHe cast himself upon the tables and feasted upon meat and all sorts of pulses and plants, his stomach readily processing them and allowing him a chance at a fighting chance when the hard times struck. His cognitive abilities improved as a result.\nSo now the ladies under his attention were given much more time to talk to him, since he could handle their inquiries and their expectations. Their hearts would be inclined toward him as time passed, because he would respond to them in their need and concerns without asking too much in return. He knew the power of love and kindness, which was why he had to castrate others using it. But the ladies, in this case, would be empowered, empowered beyond measure. He would ensure that a single one of them was left starving and uncomfortably disturbed so as to leave.\nHe drafted everything out within that village map–making mind: the skill he gained in his childhood caught up to him.\nHe smiled.\n“Rosie,” he said, having arrived next to her. “Remember what I said about Summune. She was nice, but she was a disgusting thing.” He wanted to convey hatred toward Summune, but he himself was not angry or emotional about her. He just wanted to make Rosie a part of a new world by shocking her with easily distinguisable emotions, ones that she could understand and readily adapt to. This way, she was free to live, unknowingly underpinned by him.\nWhen Rosie was adapted, she showed him a bright new world, encouraging her to leap out for salvation. He planted easily identifiable ways to escape his domain with the same motifs that characterized his false hatred. When he expressed anger, he showed openly that he had forgotten to lock the lock on the door. Even if she herself could go out anytime, showing these moments of fake weakness planted an idea inside her head. He wanted him to try to leave. That way, when he caught and spared her, it was not anymore her domain. Even the idea of escape was a falsehood, because he would be there running to spare her. He was not here to hurt her, only to show her that he didn’t want her to leave to a large world where she could just inform her faction about him. He didn’t want them, and he made that very clear, implying that he would treat her well if she only did one thing—forgive. That was why he made the elf slave girl one of her companions in this awkward phase. Even if she could leave, she didn’t know whether Mark was outside the door waiting for her. So it was conditioning on her part. He cast a metaphorical spell that made her dizzy and confused enough that any thought outside of leaving became a relaxing feeling because it was relieving, not because it was true happiness. She began to enjoy something called “relief” over happiness.\nThis would take some time and would likely fail, Mark knew. Some people never gave up, and when they did, they gave in to death rather than submission to him.\n[Manipulation skill check! Success! +1000 XP]\nHowever, he was willing to pay the price involved in organizing this operation, and he learned much of this from his own father, who had showed him what it was like firsthand, though one that Mark personally refined for his uses.\nMark masterfully guaranteed one source of information—Rosie Lasuza (Her Full Name.).\nEven if it was a failure, future operations could derive from this prototype and expand the findings and detailed ascertained. He guaranteed a success, whether it failed or not.\nBut shifting to his broader philosophical ideas and rationalizations, he believed this to be a form of child-rearing. He was taking care of people by caring for his own needs to learn. The more he learned, the more he satisfied those thoughts that needed to devote effort into loving this world and saving the people. He was stretching himself for his broader plan, and killing all those people was worth it if that meant he could potentially save millions of times more people. The notion of killing benefitting his broader plan sounded counterintuitive, but it gave him lots of experience and confidence moving forward, which advanced his strategy.\nIn the end, this was the unspeakable things he did as a man to secure Love firsthand, a very calculative operation resting upon a very philosophically- and psychologically-grounded mind.\nMeanwhile, he struck a tree, breaking it and touching it only to see it explode. It wasn’t his skill, but one of the adventurers he witnessed showcased a unique skill of his, demonstrating that he could make inanimate matter very weak enough that a few slashes could make it explode. That was what happened with the tree.\nMany adventurers were this cunning, not with their intelligence, but with their luck. It almost conveyed a sense of cunning with how fortunate they were in acquiring such revoltingly powerful abilities when he only was left with the scraps.\nHis skills were common, but not necessarily useful to the point of breaking the rules of combat. He still abided by the principles of surprise and team coordination, especially recently with the bandits.\nOh, he hated the bandits. They made him lose his marbles with how hard it was to rely on an organization that was supposed to be a non-state actor. Yet, they openly declared themselves to be this large threatening group. It took lots of effort to deal with internal tensions and the threat of a possible outing session wherein he was exposed to the public for his misdeeds and disgusting nature.\nBut he was not disgusting. He was not crazy.\nHe was just in a hurry, and that urgency and alertness required him to pursue dangerous and uncompromising acts.\nThis was his show.\nSoon afterwards, in a dungeon, he walked up to one of the Thralls, and he attempted to beat this beast, with the help of the members of the bandit team from the boss fight earlier. They were specifically asked to accompany him when he requested for extra training, a freebie provided by the bandit league, but often left unclaimed due to time constraints and the inherent dangers of acting separately from the main mobilized fighting group.\nHe struck the Thrall on the right arm before striking his left shoulder with the help of the tank member’s tackle and the archer and mage’s combined projectile attack. He leapt out of the way, as the berserker of the team charged, breaking apart the Thrall apart. The weakened Thrall was fresh food for the berserker.\nClapping, the group gathered and had another meal. It was easy times and easy life.\n[Thrall down! +50 XP]\n[Level up!]\n[Level 9: Mark Reader\nHealth: 750/750\nMana: 430/430\nArmor: 64\nMagic Resistance: 35\nSkills: Redburst; Cold Gaze]\n[To enhance clarity, common skills were omitted for brevity’s sake.]\nChapter 19 - Rosie and Xingyi linkHe set a trap, watching and waiting, his heart pounding in his chest.\nHe had killed many times before, but this was different.\nHe noticed the violet clothes the adventurer he was targetting wore. She came from a faction, and indeed, attracting possible attention by killing faction adventurers was risky. But that risk serviced him with experience.\nOnce the woman walked into his trap, she immediately removed it, surprised, thinking that one of the hunters had left it here by mistake, given that it was a remote road. And because it was a remote road, she didn’t think bandits were here. Most of the bandits she knew operated within the cities or dungeons. A bandit here would be very low-chance.\nBut before she could fully discard the slowness effect of the trap, Mark was there.\nSeveral minutes later, Mark struck deeply, his arms grasped behind the woman’s back. He immediately propelled his pelvis forward to claim stability on her body, as she had disempowered him from a healthy stance. With his newfound claim, he struck with his arm, choking her neck and pushing her down, kicking behind him to claim support on the cave floor. He struck and struck with his elbow along the distal margin to claim stability on her chest. As she began punching into the side of his belly and pulling at his hair, he got up quickly and then kicked her on the belly, as he was the one on top of her. He kept doing this until she attempted to grab him, but he immediately utilized sweeping sideways kicks to keep her guessing. She attempted to grab her feet again. He grabbed a knife that dropped earlier and struck her feet instead of making it obvious by striking her torso. She kicked at him with her feet and legs, stunning him slightly, before he grabbed her and placed his entire weight down on the stabbed leg and foot. He demarcated her view from her stabbed foot and grabbed the knife to deliver heavy strikes upon her calves. The woman fell apart psychologically, as she began getting more impulsive, using up lots of energy in the process. He backed off, as he had already won. The woman could barely run and was bleeding heavily. He followed suit like a bat, stalking her like a hunter, and brandishing his blade like a bandit.\nHe had won.\nThis was his next victim as a bandit. But he had also laid his past experiences with animals as a village child and as a hunter of men as the material basis of his animalistic and hunting intuition.\nThe woman screamed, begging for help.\nMark saw that artifact of hers that he threw to the side earlier and couldn’t help but nod happily.\nHe grabbed it and noticed that it glowed green. It exploded, destroying Mark’s focus.\nMark was dying.\nHe saw the woman giving him an offensive gesture, as he wondered what he had done wrong specifically.\nBut his thoughts were not his. They were immediate responses to oncoming death. In reality, he had a plan. He grabbed one of the potions of hers that he had tossed aside and began drinking it. He then got the other potion and drank then. He drank and drank until he finished them all, except for one.\nEven with his destroyed face and death throes, he was able to revive himself.\nHe kept himself next to the potions in case of an adverse reaction, something he learned as a village hunter when dealing with non-lethal traps that could suddenly fail and stop holding the prey down.\nThe woman squealed in fear.\nMark gave her the last potion and told her that if she signed a contract, he would save her. He needed more troops, and unwilling participants were bad. But a magical contract would make things easier.\nThe contract included lots of dos and don’ts, and they were enforceable because the gods were watching, or at least that was what he had been told. He had seen it firsthand with travelers, slaves, goblins, and adventurers. But he had never actually seen the initiation of the contact, though he knew it worked.\nThe woman sighed and said yes, signing it with pain in her teeth.\nMark looked at her, watching her, staring, possibly glaring.\nThe woman, Xinyi, was silent. Who was he? Why did he do this? Where am I?\nShe wanted to leave immediately, but where could she go?\nWho would help her?\nShe couldn’t escape this easily, could she?\nBut she had a plan. She did.\nIf she could just remove him from existence, then this would all turn out alright, right?\nShe was jinxing herself, but she had to believe in faith: believing in believing.\nTime passed, and Mark was still looking at her. Her gaze had long left contact.\n“Oh gosh,” she said under her breath.\nMark grabbed her shoulder, and then she realized. He was going to do disgusting things to her.\nShe screamed, “Help! Help!”\nHe made her drink the potion by hand—cupping his hand and bringing it to her mouth—since he wanted to save some more for later. He had no other container so.\nThe woman did not feel anything, but she felt strangely at ease despite her terror.\nMark was diligent not to let it spill, and his handsome face wasn’t helping either.\nThe problem was that the woman didn’t want to feel this mix of ease and terror.\nMark did not also want to feel guilt, so he would understand if she told her.\nWhen the woman’s body finally healed, she turned away from him and walked toward the city, Mark following along behind her with an easy gaze. He had finally controlled her for the most part, so he relaxed.\nAttachment was a very important factor in maintaining control over prey, and if that prey relied on him for emotional support, then that would make things easier.\n“Don’t trip,” he said, grabbing her since she was not looking where she was going. His hands didn’t feel forceful. It felt gentle like he wasn’t just attempting to murder earlier. Now, he treated her better than her father ever did.\n“If you’re mad, I understand. What I did was horrible. But what I want you to know is that I made a big mistake. I will not apologize for it, because I know it’s not something I can get forgiveness for. But you’re here. You. Don’t let me take away that from you.”\n“I…” What was she saying? What was she doing! “…lost my father years ago…” Fuck, fuck, no, no!\nTears pooled in her eyes, and she hated that she felt this way.\nShe hated her aggressor, yet paradoxically, this was the only time in her life she was treated like a human being.\nMark listened to her and didn’t treat her like an object (of sexual desire).\nIn fact, Mark didn’t give a shit about a woman, only seeing them as men. And that was what made his actions even more easy.\nBecause he was impartial.\nGuilt struck him, gripping his heart.\nHe fell to the ground. Tears dripped down his face. “Ugh…” His stomach ached. The underlying psychopathology of his behavior was clear, and it was impinging upon right now.\n“Are you okay?” said Xingyi.\nHe smiled weakly. “I got a tummy ache…” He made a silly look to downplay the situation.\nXingyi found herself frowning to combat the smile that threatened to emerge. She didn’t like that she felt at ease with him.\nThis was terror. It had to be.\nShe grabbed him, feeling her heart pulsing not out of fear but out of a sense of ease with someone who listened. She removed her hand, accidentally dropping him.\nMark groaned before suppressing it, trying not to bother her. “Sorry…”\n“No, it’s okay, it’s okay.” She squatted down and placed her hands on his left shoulder and hands.\nWhen they locked eyes, Mark looked away, unable to think straight. His cognitive functions were impaired due to the dual effect of his sudden pang of guilt and psychogenic tummy ache.\nShe helped him up, compressing her lips, repeatedly glancing away and keeping her head faced away from him.\nShe sat him down onto a rock. “T-thanks,” he barely said breathlessly, mostly mouthing it. “Argh.”\nMark had never had anyone. Or to be more accurate, he had had so many people, but he had lost them. “Argh…” he said as he accidentally slipped down the rock.\nWhen Xingyi saw him, she stood still, only glancing sideways at him and putting a finger on her lower lip in contemplation. She looked away promptly.\nMark was tired and exhausted, and the contract made sure that she couldn’t kill him. That was why he was at ease.\nXingyi was standing, staring at the horizon, while Mark was sitting against the rock on the ground, looking at her back and then at his surroundings\nThey stayed like that for a while.\nThe wind, the rustling of the trees, and the calls of birds, cicadas, crickets, grasshoppers, and all kinds of animals made that scene tranquil.\nThey parted ways with a sense of regret and frustration, Mark with his vulnerability, Xingyi with her despicable emotions.\nWhen Mark left, he returned to Rosie, seeing something different in her.\nHe let her out and told her that she was free to go. “Do what you want,” he said. “I’m tired right now…”\nThe silence played a longer role than he expected.\n“No,” Rosie said.\nThe sound of him removing his clothes was drawn out longer than he thought.\n“What?” he said with exasperation.\n“You won’t let me go like this. You already did it so many times, so no.”\nMark blinked hard, his head aching. He was unable to render a response, so he repeated, “Just leave.”\nHe fell asleep.\nRosie sat next to him.\nMark sighed when he woke up later. Seeing Rosie, he jumped. “Argh!” he said.\nRosie looked at him curiously and with a determined look. “I want to join you.”\n“Fuck off,” he said. “There’s… no way…” He had attempted to manipulate her, but he didn’t think she would do this. She was unpredictable. Humans were unpredictable. He was unpredictable.\nHe needed to freshen up. He was a little drowsy and dead inside. He took a shower by the river and got some fresh clothes to match. He was confused what he was doing.\nEverything betrayed his understanding of patterns and theory and his intuition.\nHe saw Rosie and Xingyi looking at him in the distance, as he stood there with his clothes on by the river. W-what the hell was going on!\n“We want to help you,” they said.\nThis was not in his plan at all.\nBut it was a good thing. It was. But losing control of his plan made him frustrated.\nHe experienced guilt still, something that popped up when he least expected it. He had to control himself and compose himself yet again.\n“Okay, then. sure. We can go.” He smiled, as if he wasn’t breaking inside.\nThese losers were irrational. Why would they go with their aggressor?\nWho were they to break his rational plan?\nThis was irrational.\nHe couldn’t comprehend why the hell they would do this. It didn’t make sense. It didn’t.\n“Rosie, Xingyi, welcome!” he said. Even he was not sure what he was doing anymore, he had to adapt to this new development, lest he lost track of the game.\nThey would hopefully play a big role moving forward. He didn’t want another Summune incident.\nLater, in a dungeon, with Mark having signing up a new adventurer party, Rosie showed off her skills as a member of the faction.\nXingyi showed her skills as a member of her faction.\nThey were strong, he thought, when he saw their skills.\nOh, this was going to be good. New recruitments. New allies. New people to fill in gaps in his broad plan.\nHe was not going to do this alone. He was going to have to blend into a giant monolith entity.\nAnd these two were the early birds.\n"

                content: " A man named Matthew with dark hair and a smirk stands on a rooftop, extending his hand toward the viewer as if inviting them in. He’s dressed in elegant, dark clothing with a pop of color from a red-orange undershirt. The background is a city at night, bathed in cool blue tones with buildings silhouetted against the sky. The title, “Matthew,” is written in a bold, white, handwritten font at the bottom of the image. Below the title, in a smaller, simpler font, is the tagline: “The Epitome of Grace and Beauty - An Intellectual Psychological Isekai LitRPG”\nBook Description:\nMatthew, a once ordinary man, had his life abruptly snatched away. Despite a content existence on Earth, surrounded by loved ones and knowledge, he found himself thrust into a new world, devoid of care or compassion. Struggling to adapt, he relied on his intellect to navigate the chaos around him. Every action held consequence, with death lurking at every turn. Determined to maintain his sanity and control, he sought to make sense of his surroundings and establish dominance. Yet, beneath his turmoil, a realization dawned—to survive, he must embody grace and beauty, transcending the chaos that engulfed him. He would become the epitome of grace and beauty. He was not crazy. He was just like everyone else. But he had to become everything.\n1 chapter everyday; 2500 average word count; 2 PM CET\nChapter 1 - A World Apart link Author’s note\nThe Github commit page (version history) for revision updates\nThe blog for more formal status reports\nTo begin, the goblin stood in front of Matthew, whose face was sure and committed, his breath cycling without pause, and the blade he held thirsty for a syrupy strike.\nEven now, Matthew grinned; a vague multifaceted impression of intentions lingering behind his expression—time would not pause for him.\nHe would have to guide it himself, his grip fiery in form, the edges of his blade twanging endlessly for justification. Furthermore, hidden with him lay thoughts of self-assuredness and the concept of being or becoming the epitome of grace and beauty—a process that needed both external and internal affirmation as demanding as two beggars on the streets glancing from side to side.\nIn conclusion, he raised his blade as if to slash.\nBefore this month, things were different, so different. If Matthew only knew, if he did, he wouldn’t be thinking the way he was now, stuck in contemplation like some stuck-up little nobody too involved with his daydreams.\nHe was daydreaming indeed, his thoughts a hurricane of imagination and considerations like a scholar reading bookshelves-worth of information within any given year. It was excessive. It was wonderful. And it was nonsensical.\nMoving into that daydreaming mind of his, sounds and pops emerged rectilinearly throughout, a process comparable to the connection between someone riding a horse into the sea and the over-beeping of a car horn. It was strange and excessive with little synchrony in between them, except for that sensation that they came in lines, similar to tasting orange after seeing a cloud when tripping out on hallucinogens. It didn’t have the same energy as someone fighting with a blade or crushing an opponent in a life-or-death situation. It was just him making empty ideas in his brain in an imaginative way.\nTo explore his imaginative mind further, one could start with this bundle of ideas: “The briefness of flight and the sky hiding above—they all gather together to form my presence. My eyes know that I am alive.”\nThen, furthermore, this mind could be found more surreal and riveting with this statement: “A drop of ice cubes almost clanked in his ear before he was taken back to reality, where sounds zoomed and tore through the air. This could be likened to artistic noise cycling over a spreadsheet. With all of this poking his senses, he wanted to escape into his mind.”\nIt kept going and going, not a single breath wasted. All energy was devoted to this cause of inspiration.\n“Morning, night. It could be any other day. But today was different. He was here at home, eating breakfast. That was what separated his life from everyone else—he was who he was right now.”\n“He looked behind him, in front of him, and all around because this place was familiar and it was everything that he knew. If something took it all away, then he would lose his mind.”\n“This was his mental state, clear and unhindered, carrying out its duties as a soul would. This was his hope and his mind. This was where he placed himself consciously with ebbs and flows. This was self-awareness—the knowledge that as a consequence of his own thought, he existed.”\n“Breaking apart from this philosophical reflection, a quiet, magical song progressively intensified in the background like a green monster stalking in the shadows.”\n“Time passed. It was only a few seconds, but it was enough to make someone feel hurt and pain. It was enough to break a soul.”\n“He was here, and everywhere around him, there was life.”\n“From his left, cheers of excitement flew throughout the home, contrasting the possibilities of death staining this world.”\n“To his right, words about games oozed with hearty pleasure, taking the form of tangible sounds that conflicted with existential hardship.”\n“All around him, these voices echoed, mimicking the anticipation a student felt before their test results.:\n“When they did, they passed each point of the house.”\n“And at each point, the various memories associated with it bloomed, imbuing Matthew with a nostalgic fondness for how temporary things could be.”\n“The silence continued to draw forth Matthew’s introspection with whirling winds.”\n“Shifting to his expression, a smile stretched across his lips, holding up his light-weight cheeks.”\n“Nevertheless, he continued his assessment of his environment, imagining himself with his family forever and the feeling of losing them.”\n“The final touch of his thoughts involved the scent of acrylic wafting close. It hailed from the remains of an unfinished blue paint job. With a nearby sniff, it gloated with characteristics like honey and of a coming sourness.”\n“In the end, he found love in the people around him.”\nHis thoughts continued on and on, and it never ended.\nMeanwhile, Matthew’s siblings at the same table were engaged in a conversation about a game.\n“Yeah! and the fact that they used that champion is what scared me the most!” said Matthew’s youngest brother, Jerome. “I already knew that game was over!”\n“Yeah!” said Mark, the second-to-youngest brother, headphones slithering around his neck as it fell. But he caught it before his smile dampened.\nAnother voice pitched in, another of Matthew’s brothers: “Do they even read patch notes? I’m honestly confuddled!”\nThey were all his brothers, but some family friends passed by. So it was a gathering.\nSoon, the voices sounded more faint as Matthew faded sleepily into the night.\nBut before that happened, Matthew himself added: “No, of course not! At this point, they should just retire the players. Just kidding.” He was the eldest.\nAs soon as Matthew’s focus diverged from the conversation, he learned there was still more chicken, so he gestured. Eventually, someone passed it to him.\nAs soon as he began eating, movements slowed down, and the mood began to embody still life in its form. Though, in life, there was a cycle.\nConsequently, Matthew himself noticed these realizations and realized that he was being mindful, making a smile.\nEventually, as he smiled, his thoughts and concerns stopped at the appearance of a familiar smell—burning.\nFor some reason, this time, that smell marked something new.\nThings were shifting like the movements of a hurricane.\nBut life was always like that.\nYet, this situation was different. Things were morphing.\nMeanwhile, he noticed that the streets outside his window had this green magical hue, but it disappeared when he removed his glasses. He realized that the light bounced against his glasses in a unique way, cultivating his curiosity for what lay ahead in his awesome life.\nPivoting his focus to his brothers, he noticed his brothers’ voices crescendoing.\nBut in a moment’s notice, they turned pitch black, still as a picture.\nSuddenly, Matthew’s smile dropped, and he began to stare at them for a moment, realization creeping in, facial expressions warping through and through.\nBut he suddenly disappeared, his open mouth cut off, his scream making waves across the universe.\nAll those years with his brothers turned to ashes, resting solely upon his memories moving forward.\nSoon, as quickly as he disappeared, his eyes opened like the flip of a switch.\nThis was when he stopped thinking. His eyes let in light.\nFocusing on the moment and the colors and shapes in his vision, he started to get a creeping sense.\nHe opened and closed his eyes again and again like a paratrooper falling into enemy fire.\nHis internal systems were trembling, making way for realization.\nThen, his physical body responded in the form of shakings and tremors all across his body.\nHe stopped breathing, but he took a breath at a time he didn’t notice.\nHis body began to sweat.\nCollapsing, he thought he was still standing.\nHis eyes darting around, the headaches surged.\nHe lay still.\nThis agony took 30 minutes to complete. At the end of it, he said his first words, “Am I…” He was in a new world.\nWhere was he? He looked around; even his eyes were strange.\nWith time, naturally, the color green and the forest sharpened in his vision.\nHe breathed deep, still unable to exhale efficiently.\nThe light was lighter now like a bottle of glass reflecting sunlight, and his mind was easier.\nBreeze of this world touching his skin, it marked the first time he was in a different world.\nHe was here in a different world.\n“What’s happening?” he proclaimed, his voice waving around and spinning in different places. The sense of disorientation extended to his mouth.\nWaiting, he fixed his breath, then tested it, then hyperventilated briefly before returning to normal. He sniffed the air and the organic smells. He yearned to know where he was right now.\nHis heart paused when it heard a rustle in the background.\nLooking around, his heart revved up again, opened up room for a nagging emotion: chaos, anarchy, and a sense that nothing would be the same. But he hoped it was similar to what it was like being a teenager: feeling strong emotions and pain that soon disappeared as if they were never there.\nThe background rustle was forgotten.\n“Where am I?” he asked, a forced smile making its way into his face.\nMeanwhile, the rustle found its origin—a group of green monsters seeing him in the distance, their faces clearing by the second.\nActually, he didn’t see them because he wasn’t looking. Yes, his head was turned away.\nRapidly, the monsters increased their footsteps per second. They dashed.\nMatthew heard them, turning around, seeing that moments were shortening now that the monsters were on the move.\nHe glared out of fear, stumbling a little.\nHe gasped, his huffing voice trailing behind him. He hadn’t been able to find the time to breathe or say something. “What the hell!” he yelled with a croak, his voice puncturing his expression with the sense that he was going to die.\nHis voice parachuted behind him and echoed past the monsters, alerting them of his precise spot.\n“Please!” He bolted, his heart leaping in lumps, shaking.\nSeveral warty pigs emerged on his left side, taking off out from the bushes and stumbling along Matthew’s path.\nSeveral monsters caught up to them in the distance, their feet grabbing into the terrain.\nHe leapt, his mouth shaking. “No!”\nBehind him, two monsters reached a tree, launching themselves several leaps forward.\nNearby, Matthew looked at them as time slowed. In the same breath, the pigs tripped and fell after he unintentionally dodged in their path.\nFrom behind, ramping fast, a monster’s weapon found its mark on a tree next to Matthew after it was thrown. It had pierced through a pig. Due to tunnel-visioning at the pigs, the opportunity to kill Matthew evaporated.\n“Please! No!” Matthew pushed on, struggling recklessly, tearing a tiny hole in his shirt, as he pulled himself and struggled against the dense vegetation.\nHe climbed down a slope, but it was too steep and rugged, leaving little time to escape. He looked behind him and kept going, running down until he slipped on the sand-like material on the ground.\nWhen he fell, his back hit the earth, and he screamed in pain.\nThe shadows of a set of weapons began hovering behind Matthew.\n“No, no, please!” He closed his eyes, knowing that he could die at any moment.\nHe looked at the sky, his face crumping.\nHe yelled, seizing the next branch and pulling himself forward.\nA moment afterwards, he was pulled against the monsters’ fists, as he hollered with pain. He begged for his life, the blades striking through skin and muscle. Motions turned into succinct lines, and his heart became a sinking swine–like cry.\n“Noo!” His voice was beaten to a crisp.\nLong afterward, when Matthew came to his senses, the shadows of people drifted past him.\nAlso, in his daze, he could only make out the blades flying past his face. Indeed, he nearly died, so he stood up.\nBut he felt a hand touching his shoulder, healing his body.\n“Thank you,” he said, still unsure how to comprehend his situation, emotions becoming repressed in his saviors’ wake.\n“Who are you?” he continued, fixing his hair instinctively at the sight of a person.\nThe person who saved him, a healer, nodded, saying: “You should rest. Don’t worry about us. We’ll talk later.” Behind her, a group of adventurers were running around, killing off the last goblins.\nNow that he was given space, Matthew’s eyes darted around, looking for safety, but he was in a state of disarray, broken beyond measure. But maybe, this day would end, and he would disappear. He was safe, but his mind remained tortured.\nHe smiled a broken smile, as the healer turned around and joined her teammates.\nAs he processed the past series of events, the adventurers who had saved him finished cleaning up the rest of the goblins, forming a circle where they ate and drank to celebrate.\n“It’s the fact that he was laughing at that that made me so surprised!”\nA chorus of laughter followed.\n“And, and as soon as he heard me, he was already out running!”\nMore laughter broke out.\nIn the meantime, nearby, Matthew began trying to talk with one of the adventurers.\n“Yeah, we had to fix up the goblin list. It wasn’t all that easy today…”\nThe adventurer kept talking on and on, including strange terminology, and Matthew overestimated his energy levels, not being able to analyze his words.\nMatthew suddenly thanked him, extending this thanks to the whole group.\nBut days later, he burst into tears and grieved for his family that he loved back on Earth.\nHe said: “Ma… Dad… Mark… Jerome… Gabriel… I’m sorry.”\nThis was every day of his life now.\nHowever, with time, Matthew found it easier to focus his energy inward, as he aggregated his thoughts.\nHe was everything that everyone wanted to be, but he was trapped in a jail cell. It was like when he was younger and when things were still bad at home. During those days, he would look through the bars of the staircase, through the window, and through the arrows of the gate just to have his eyes meet with an enormous structure that blocked most of his view of the sky. He did this when he felt most trapped by his domestic circumstances, and this set of coincidental physical representations of his feelings gave him a sense of place. Now, he was reminded of this coincidence, and he wished that he could return home.\nHe was homesick and nostalgic like Swiss mercenaries who missed the beauty of the countryside. Even if Earth in 2024 was horrific in many ways, it was the only place he could call home. It was a horrible place that he had growth accustomed to and experienced a lot of good and bad things in that he felt that he could no longer go anywhere else without completely eliminating himself as a person.\nHis social life, family, friends, sources of happiness, coping mechanisms, history, past experiences, and interests all lay on Earth, not in this new world he was in. Even if he travelled on Earth, as long as he was still with his family, he could enjoy himself and still feel real and memorable. Even the bad things on Earth gave him a sense of purpose because he had been dealing with them long enough to feel that he could keep going and continue resisting them. However, in this new world, he would face new challenges that he had never faced before.\nEssentially, he was an immigrant who had lost his stable native life and job to work at the bottom in a whole new country.\nTo be honest, if he had to lower the seriousness a bit, he would think about his favorite dishes like sinigang, pork sisig, and other Filipino food. Though, he did feel a sense of wonder for the dishes of this new world similar to how he felt about konbini food, or food found in Japanese convenience stores.\nMaybe, he could be okay. That was also what the guy at the adventurer guild suggested: “You could be okay.”\n“I could,” Matthew said with a smile on his face, that which he prepared for social situations. But no, he was happy to talk with someone. It was better than torture.\n“I remember a lot of things,” he continued. “I remember the sun, the earth, and all the flavors of the… time I was still just sitting down…”\n“Huh?” the adventurer said. “What do you mean?”\n“It’s hard to explain.” Matthew knew that nothing could explain what it felt like to exist.\nIt was too difficult for him.\nHe knew that isolation was a resultant threat to his sanity.\nSo with enough time to ponder, he looked around, his heart beating in all the wrong places. Indeed, he made up a motley of people, him being the most out of place. His clothes were still the white shirt and shorts he usually wore at home.\nAs for his current location, he was sitting inside an inn where tens of people were eating, drinking, and sharing stories and concerns. It was a hub of living people, and it was not the kind of place that he could just tamper with without considering his duties and rights.\nIf someone decided to punch him in the face, he could not just use the logic of his culture and society at Earth to justify the rationale behind his subsequent response.\nHe needed to align himself with this new world and its bylaws, which meant that he had to assess each person seriously with a great focus placed on how liked they were.\nThis way, he could trace the roots of likability in this new environment. Basically, his college degree did more than give him essays to write.\nAdditionally, it gave him a sense of agency in teams, so even though he lacked a team, he considered the people around him as team members.\nAll he had to do was find out exactly how each person fit into society.\nIt all started from this inn.\nChapter 2 - Navigating the Unknown: Entering the Realm of Questions linkFirst, Matthew could start with a list of essential questions, so he did. Though, he was risking outing himself, but with the inn regulars’ help, maybe he could seem like a drunk or some foreigner with his modern clothes and unique ethnic appearance.\nHe said: “Where exactly am I? Is there a name for this place or region?”\nA hooded figure clad in flowing robes, clutching a staff crackling with hints of lightning, nodded as he stood, his bread and butter of a beard dousing his short tunic with a ruggedly handsome note. He said, his voice like a singing brass: “Hell, indeed, if you want to know, just check the [System]. It’ll give you coordinates of where you are. Moreover, you can also find out whether how many days have passed since this world was created. Weird question. But you’re joking right?” He chuckled politely.\nHis name was Thorne.\nMatthew answered, his voice as clear as the tropical jungle ate up space in the sky. “No, I honestly don’t know about what’s going on. It’s not [System] I know at all. Whatever you’re talking about. But I am… I want to say thank you, and I really hope you can keep answering questions because it would be helpful.” It was a little nerve-wracking for him to be so clear, considering that he was the outsider here in a new culture, leaving him very vulnerable.\nWhen the affirmative responses he got were short and left much to interpretation but with tones of openness and enjoyment, he continued, albeit carefully watching the most forward and least forward, comparing their reactions to get a quick assessment of the general acceptance rate since that could change in response to his following questions.\n“What is the [System]? And how does that relate to showing coordinates?”\n“It shows it by showing you through the words. You can see it. Just think about the [System].”\nMatthew wasn’t sure, so he tried. After a minute of trying sheepishly to get it to work, he followed up on with another question. “How is it supposed to work? Are there any other actions I must take?”\n“No, it’s supposed to show you as soon as you form the intention for it to appear.”\n“Well, it’s not working.”\nThorne told another regular named “Elara,” “Hmm… Ela, what’s happening here?”\n“I don’t know. But maybe he’s cursed?” Elara said and glanced at the other regulars, prompting them to respond.\nThorne continued: “Maybe… Maybe.”\nMatthew didn’t look nervous, but his heart was ramping quickly, concerned about the possibility of a curse. If he really was, he would ask for help about it. That was the only thing he could do. Children asked many questions, and he was effectively a child in this new world.\nThe smell of food entered the kitchen. It was the first batch of the day, and Matthew hadn’t eaten yet. So the other regulars told him to wait for a few days and that the [System] might work again then, inviting him to eat with them.\nAfter Matthew ate, he reunited with the adventurers who saved him outside near the stalls. They made him enter the inn because they were engaging in routine work as merchants and helping organize the bazaar where they worked. So they gave him some money to buy food, but the inn regulars were kind to him since he entertained them as a curious, reserved, approachable young man.\nBut he wanted to finish the rest of his questions, but he wanted to stick close to the adventurers for now instead of loitering at the inn.\nIn the end, he couldn’t push it and focused on observation.\nAnyway, he had one concern weighing on his mind.\nSince he was staying in a city, getting out often entailed dangers and a lack of a support system for any ambitions he had in mind.\nAdditionally, his initial goals for starting in this city included learning how to get in and out the city with ease, as some territories had a tendency toward border control. In order for him to find out whether the territory he was in had strict border control or not, he had to ask around.\nFortunately, a group of teenagers who were looking to please older adventurers, especially those who had saved Matthew, presented themselves. Matthew took advantage of this opportunity and asked an important question, “Can I just go outside the city?”\n“Sure, you can,” said one of the teenagers.\n“How about back in?”\n“Yes—”\nAnother teenager interjected: “Hey, I finally got my quest. Let’s go!”\n“Third week?” said a third teenager. “Let’s go!”\n“What was—” Matthew said.\n“Wait a minute,” said one of the adventurers. “That’s only if you’re registered. Are you registered?” He was referring to going in and out the city.\n“No,” said Matthew politely.\n“Then… let me show you how to register…”\n“What was that about the third quest?”\n“Huh, the quest you get every three weeks? You should have one right now…”\n“I don’t.”\n“Huh. Are you new to the [System] somehow? That’s weird. Anyway…” He beckoned Matthew with his hand. “Come on.”\nSince the adventurers gave him space instead of conversing with him, Matthew had to give up the potential of understanding through them and opt for contemplation. If he could visit a village or a small, more remote town, that would give him an idea of how “regular” life was like for most people. However, at the moment, he was in the middle of a bustling urban populace, so it was hard to glimpse the broader world and its flow. In more complex terms, finding out the threads that kept together certain structures and how they combined to fill the needs and demands of various markets would enable him to pinpoint the source most appropriate for his time, space, and resources.\nReturning to a lighter mood, Matthew found himself observing and listening to the adventurers in the background and the way they bantered.\nWhen the adventurer who had beckoned Matthew got him registered, Matthew asked, “Is there a village or a small town nearby?”\n“No.” The adventurer smiled and then burst into a chuckle. “Yes. I’m just playing with you.”\nMatthew smiled slightly, still hesitant to respond strongly.\nWhen the adventurer calmed down, he stared for a moment, glanced at his fellow adventurers, and returned his gaze at Matthew. “Why? Do you want to go there? I can accompany you there.” His name was Deathbringer.\nCurrently, they were inside an office building, and next to them, someone was watching.\nThis watching person spoke up when he ascertained the lull in their conversation: “Okay, Matthew. Okay, Mr. Deathbringer. What do we have here? I see both your names, but I don’t see a licence to visit one of the ‘villages’.”\nHe was the registrant, and he was the way for Matthew to register as part of the city to get in and out.\n“No, not one of the monster dens. We don’t mean that.” Deathbringer turned his attention to Matthew, telling the other adventurers to vacate the room and head outside with a gresture. “Sorry, if you don’t know, the villages he’s talking about refer to the monster dens. It’s where monsters appear every few seconds and stuff.”\nWith that said, Matthew tilted his head to the left and kept his eyes curious with the intention of looking approachable.\nHis place in the conversation was brief, but he knew that he could continue to listen and observe, accumulating knowledge even as a spectator.\nDeathbringer told the registrant, “Since Matthew is newly entered, is it okay if you complete our reports for us? Also, the golem should help out in occasions like these, right?”\nThe registrant nodded, waving his hands to cast a spell that made a loud drumming sound lasting for a several seconds.\nWith the magical cue of the registrant, a golem at the entrance moved around, having served as a stationary part of the entrance structure. But currently, his purpose extended beyond visual decor, giving a sense of dynamism. While he might be a golem, Matthew noticed it glancing appraisingly at the adventurers behind Matthew and Deathbringer. These adventurers were sitting sparsely at many two-seat tables. Moreover, they talked in a mirthful manner across tables, resting their arms on the backrests, sitting down sideways, and having one leg crossed over the other. In addition, often times, they mirrored each other’s postures like a bunch of monkeys, but rather than involving manipulation, this reflected their deep-seated camaraderie as friends of many years.\nWhen the golem went outside, it quickly offered a hand of support toward Matthew, the newly registered person.\nThe registrant at the concierge explained about the golem, “She will help you through the muddy path you took earlier on the way here. She’ll lead you to the main road; there, she will drop you off.”\nDuring his explanation, Matthew kept glancing at Deathbringer to understand the nuances of the registrant’s words through him. He was much more mindful of this since he was a foreigner but especially since he heard that the term ‘village’ could refer to monster dens as well.\nEarlier at the registration building, the registrant observed Matthew’s expression and thought. Depending on Matthew’s next actions, he could be a one of the new adventurers his boss was expecting. In the end, with the monsters growing day by day, more fodder was needed to ensure that the monsters never breached the walls of the city. This was a necessity.\nThe next day, when Matthew came to another village, he began to develop a certain inclination. Simultaneously, his mind began to recall various memories of simulations he had coded. Namely, he would press the “Run” button and watch his creations spur into life, as each agent in his program began to embody the functions he had given them. This moment of observing a village was similar to that moment. It was the inspiration of a creator and level editor that made him almost irrationally excited.\nHe ran to the village and became enamoured with the way their culture manifested. The way their houses aligned with the various pipes circulating through the open canals of the village made him feel so delighted. It was as if he was seeing the agents of his game burst into artificial intelligence life. Basically, he saw the villagers like little tiny characters.\nThe villagers, seeing his stare, began to gossip about him. Even if their communication was largely unsystematic, they did have ideals in place for what to do with travelers and strangers. In short, they wanted to manage him with everything that entailed.\nDoing away with the background, Matthew greeted one of the villagers, prompting a long discussion. However, instead of an easy, fruitful discussion, the villagers had their own reservations, interests, and concerns, so it took the most sociable of the adventurer group, Marcher, to convince them indirectly to talk. Instead of framing the discussion as a way to get information, Marcher framed it as a way to advice the villagers on how to sell their coffee beans more effectively. Specifically, he told them that selling the beans while they were still yellow and raw was not going to sell well with the clients. To add to this, he asked them: “Do you guys like the yellow? How did it taste?”\n“Bad,” one of the leading villagers said.\nMarcher nodded. “Yes, so if the beans itself taste bad, why should you think that turning it into coffee would make it taste good? There’s a difference in taste. So it’s not going to work really if you guys sell it in yellow. Red is the only way to go, because it’s sweet that way. The clients like that.” ** Instead of saying yes with submission, the two leading villagers opted to stay silent, seeing that they were wrong in this matter. However, their silence was telling enough. As a result, Marcher relaxed and returned to his place among the adventurers.\nFor context, Marcher procured connections with numerous people, and he was knowledgeable about the coffee process, business, and market.\nAs a mere spectator, Matthew only stood still like a model waiting for her chauffeur, while the other adventurers, including Deathbringer, interacted with the village children in a engaging way. To Matthew, they were just background numbers in a research paper concerning children, but to the adventurers, the children were smaller versions of themselves, because they were still in touch with their child selves as what was typical of their explorative, curious, and adventurous occupation. They saw potential and a whole world behind those children’s eyes, empathy flowing like a broken river dam. But this empathy was more than emotions. It was an understanding of potential growth and how the most effective holistic strategies could extricate this growth from a curious child.\nIn the meantime, Matthew viewed the mountain next to the village and the different groups of trees that looked identifiable now that he was closer. In the distance, earlier, the trees all looked the same, just one green pile of bushy vegetation. But now, it was like looking at segmented aspects of a complex dynamic structure. It scared him to think that the mountain was alive, because it invited interest on a more analytical level.\nThen, to curb his nervous excitement for study, Matthew turned his in-depth attention toward Deathbringer, but as time passed, he noticed hints of intelligence from the children, while Deathbringer talked casually. It was as if the guise of nonchalance rested upon an even more seemingly sinister systematic rationale: grooming a child to become their best selves.\nFinally, feeling overwhelmed, Matthew wanted the world to stop, so he focused on the palms of his raised hands. As he focused, he began to recognize where he was.\nFirst, the sun shone in a lively manner like a sapient deep vase breathing deep fumes into the mouth of a cat. Second, the ground felt dependable yet soft like a man embracing his child. Third, the sky felt graceful like birds crafting and engraving curved blades with a performative approach. Lastly, hints of the night such as the flames of light marking each household nearby deepened the communal aspect of this small society. This could be compared to fresh charcoals thrown breezily into a furnace. In conclusion, this was the general atmosphere.\nWhen looking around him, he couldn’t help but appreciate his saviors for saving him.\nTo explore these saviors in detail, they ranged from bright colored skies to those who looked like they had been thrown off a roof or smacked against a ceiling. When it came to their appearances, they were functional and nondescript, and Matthew concerned himself only with pronounced details. Moving forward, several details that came to his mind were the lack of weapons that they held when compared to other adventurers in the vicinity, the excessive complaints of hating traveling, and the way they kept their distance from each other despite the apparent camaraderie in their conversations. When combining these details together, they hinted at a lack of committment to or compatibility with their traveling, combat-ready, and team-based profession.\nBut he didn’t want to rely on his assumptions. Hopefully, he was wrong.\nMeanwhile, the nearby palm trees and their vegetation-covered trunks caught Matthew attention for the rest of the time he was in the city, as did many of the other plants of the environment.\nAnd soon, they left the village and returned home to the city. At the city, Matthew entered an inn, using the money he was given, and lay down to sleep. He wondered if the adventurers would abandon and throw him away. This was a perfunctory, sleepy thought, but it was a real concern.\nThen, the next day, in a meeting at a cafe, Matthew was invited. “Progression,” said the healer who had saved him from the goblins days ago. “Have you thought about it?” Her face and demeanor was soft-spoken and mild-mannered, telling nothing about her ambitions.\n“Is that like a concept or what?” said Matthew, his eyebags a little weighty.\n“Yes. But if you want, we have levels both in a staircase and in a system.”\n“What?”\n“Yeah, if you just press your wrist here, and, of course, I’ll have to make sure you actually receive it…” She was speaking in a step-by-step voice, tapping Matthew’s wrist. “There!”\nHe saw a blue glow emerge from her hand and his wrist. “What happened?”\n“You got the system level, so now, you can say [System]. And you’ll be able to know exactly what your skill set is. Though, I’m afraid you’re not actually skilled yet.”\nMatthew pretended to be offended, because he was sure that she misspoke.\nShe continued: “But what I’m saying is that you’re still new to this all. So you shouldn’t have any spells or skills and whatnot.”\nMatthew slowly spoke with a confused inflection, “Okay…?”\n“Yeah, yeah, so basically, say [System].”\n“[System]”\nAfter a pregnant pause, Matthew shifted his attention from the middle of his view to the healer. “So what level am I?’\n“Oh, it’s not showing?”\n“It doesn’t show for me.”\n“Uh, that’s a problem.” She began speaking as if she was thinking out loud. “Is it because you didn’t say it right?”\n“[System],” Matthew repeated, glancing at the neutral expressions of the other adventurers around the healer.\nHe waited for a moment before the healer said, “Nothing?”\n“Nothing,” Matthew confirmed.\n“W-what the hell is happening?”\n“It’s weird, no?” Matthew assumed that this was not normal.\n“It’s not weird. I mean, yes, it’s weird, but why is it happening to you?”\n“It’s not supposed to happen to me?”\nShe interjected, “It’s not supposed to happen until you’re level 20. Are you level 20?”\n“No… Maybe?”\n“Yeah, you’re not level 20. So there must be something else.”\n“What… do you think?”\n“Death, what did you see earlier in the forecast?”\n“It said that we have several troubles passing us today,” said Deathbringer, walking up.\n“Is it that bad based on the tone?”\n“No, it was actually optimistic.”\n“Then what?”\n“I-it could be the broken tulips from the other day in the mission.”\n“Which one?” She sounded frustrated. “Sorry…” She softened her tone. “Which one?”\n“It was the one with the ‘Barkada.’”\n“If it’s that, then I don’t see why that should still apply the same mark effect on us right now.”\n“Matthew, do you know about this?” said the healer.\n“No… Not that I know of?” Matthew said, beginning to frown.\n“If you don’t get this finished, you won’t be able to go with us to the dungeon steps.”\n“Dungeon… steps?”\n“Yeah. There’s a dungeon steps nearby. It’s just spawned, so we wanted you to come. But now, I’m thinking that it won’t be possible today, sorry. It’s just that your [System]—Oh, I brought up mine… Closing it… It’s just that your system is broken, and we should fix it. But we don’t know how. Can you be patient while we ask our friends and contacts about this? You can sit down. I’m going to have a messenger visit the people I know. Don’t worry. It will only take a couple days. The messenger will be taking the speed boost. Of course, if you have any questions, just ask Deathbringer. He knows everything I know and more.”\n“Sure!” Matthew said in an optimistic tone to shield himself from the lingering mood.\nAfter the healer left, he sheepishly asked Deathbringer what her name was.\nDeathbringer said, “Sophia.”\nWith the adventurers bantering as they carried crates past him, Matthew smiled endearingly.\nIn the meantime, Matthew and the adventurers were headed to a bazaar where they would be retailing vegetable and fruit supplies.\nAfter the bazaar retailing ended, Matthew and the adventurers left.\nTheir next destination was a dungeon steps.\nChapter 3 - Revelations and Realizations in the Dungeon Steps linkEven though he enjoyed how varied his day was, he was happy to see that the adventurers in front of him had stopped to sit and lie down. Particularly, they did this on an upside-down, unfinished canoe under a large tree. To clarify, they were resting since they had been trekking all day through urban streets and the jungle. Moreover, their legs were still a little affected from the past week since they saved and took in Matthew.\nMeanwhile, Deathbringer looked around, catching Matthew’s attention, as children squatted down next to him. As for why this was the case, Matthew didn’t know, but he asked.\nDeathbringer answered, “They’re my followers.”\nFlying “WTFs” were bursting around Matthew’s head right now. “That’s… something…” He thought this situation wasn’t logical, but he kept his eyes peeled, though a little bewildered.\nDeathbringer smiled, a levitating, holographic map appearing in front of him. “You see this?”\nMatthew nodded with caution, having seen the map before, but he never saw it this close. He pointed humbly, expressing his awe.\nTaking this gesture as a question, Deathbringer smirked with excitement. “The shapes here are called ‘dungeon steps.’ That, that, and that is a dungeon flight of steps or staircase, so they’re basically objectives… spread all around this map-world. So since the monsters of these steps were dangerous, whoever controlled these dungeons had power in their own regions—the regions they were placed.”\n“What are the rewards?” Matthew asked, thinking of items like crossbows that could be bought repeatedly from villagers with progressing refinement. If dungeons functioned similar to this, then they would be fountations of loot, providing an exclusive, “only-the-strong” path forward.\nIn the meantime, while Matthew and the adventurers were traveling in the wilderness, Sophia, the healer, was busy arranging talks with various people back at the city all around. Indeed, it was during this time that she waited for the messengers involving Matthew’s malfunctioning system to arrive, delegating her younger brother to stand outside the cafe where the messengers would arrive.\nTo reproduce Matthew’s current circumstances from a combat-focused data view, a list of stats could be drawn.\nName: Matthew Cruz\nSpecies: Human\nAge: 25\nSkills: None\nSpells: None / None\nVitality: 15\nQuests: None\nReturning to reality, as soon as Matthew and the other adventurers reached the dungeon steps, Matthew wanted to act independently, so he decided to observe and draw his findings as to how he could perform effectively amid the threats mentioned by Deathbringer. These threats included common goblins, skeletons, zombies, and skeletons.\nHowever, Matthew wanted to understand whether these threats were the same across all individuals of each species. Basically, he wanted to see if they were all the same, because according to Deathbringer, individual monsters could spawn with hidden, dangerous attributes such as increased speed, strength, and stamina. Furthermore, strange abilities could emerge, sometimes creating ’trouble-maker’-type monsters that invited swift annihilation.\nFrom another angle, Deathbringer said that these monsters were essential components of their own ecosystem, so they had to obey the ‘monster warden’ stationed here. Essentially, this warden ensured that adventurers engaged in sustainable monster hunting.\nEven with all this assessment, Matthew wanted to address the underlying issues of his predicament. Specifically, he was stuck in a fantasy world, and he wanted to escape out of it. Hopefully, he could get out of this virtual-like bubble and return to his game room back at home. However, no clear option to escape presented itself, so he had to learn how to cope with what was available.\nIn the end, he could not sit down and continue to watch people engage in all of his action. He was tired of things happening so fast. He had to slow down, as he was already in his twenties when the best thing to do was find a stable job. That attitude extended here to this new world. He didn’t want to do something risky like engaging in monster fights without at least having insurance or some stable life to return to even if he got badly injured. He was not going to sit here and pretend that he was invincible. If he pushed himself too much and got sick, he might not be able to exploit healing infinitely. So he wanted to be honest here about his limitations. However, part of him was optimistic that this new world would bring new possibilities that he couldn’t even dream of. So he focused on managing his emotions and preparing for anything new that might blow his socks off.\nIn the distance, a goblin provided a means for him to analyze something. If he could tear into the goblin analytically, then maybe he could find exactly what he was looking for in this world.\nHowever, as he began his cursory glance across the goblin’s body, holographic text popped up.\nName: Mawkery\nSpecies: Goblin\nAge: 6\nSkills: Red Bite\nSpells: None / None\nVitality: 8\nMatthew stopped following the adventurers, as they closed in on a group of goblins which included the one he was assessing. “What…”\nOne of the adventurers, Brackern, keen to Matthew’s concerns, asked, “Why?”\n“I can see things on my screen,” said Matthew. “I can see words…”\n“That’s, that’s good!” said Brackern, his blond hair tasting the wind in spate. “It’s finally working, guys.”\nThe adventurers celebrated with a smile and a nod, as they raised their blades in hedgehog formation.\nComing from multiple directions, the goblins began throwing themselves one by one at the adventurers, their bodies becoming skewered against the adventurers’ spears. As soon as the first wave of goblins ran out, they retreated, leaving the adventurers to move forward to press the advantage. However, as soon as the adventurers came close enough, hidden and separated goblin archers shot at the openings that emerged during their advance. This resulted in some casualties, leaving the adventurers weakened morally. As for why the goblins were still confident in their victory, it was because they knew the patterns. But the adventurers had magic up their sleeves. As a consequence of this, costly blasts of magic began flying at the goblin archers, denying them comfortable space, disrupting their onslaught of arrows, and killing some of them. The goblins were afraid that the adventurers had enough magic to kill them all, so they withdrew from the fight. The fight ended in a costly stalemate.\nMatthew imagined himself threatening the goblin, but he was rightfully nervous. Even if he was self-confident, he wasn’t self-important to overseer issues that he had little to no clue about. The underlying reasons for his nervousness reflected his social intelligence. He couldn’t magically know everything through interpretation, assumption. and preconceptions. He needed dispassionately shared knowledge from an author who had little to do with those facts. This was the route of an intellectual living in a world not made to revolve around challenging and rewarding them in an artificial manner.\n“What the hell!”\n“Arghh! No! No! No!”\n“Mama! Aaah!”\n“Fred! Fred…!”\nThe exasperated and extreme voices broke Matthew out of his stasis. The disgusting sound of loss penetrated the air.\nMatthew stared.\n“Aaaah! God! Why!”\nGrowling, barking, screaming, wailing, and yelling emerged, as a putrid mix of emotions began to eat up everyone.\nIn contrast, with the help of some received knowledge from the inn regulars from a while ago, Matthew understood these adventurers to some degree. This made it easier for him to empathize with them. However, he would not overextend by falling with them in grief. He was here to work things out. This way, he could make a system, not the [System], but an organized, systematic lifestyle that worked effectively for his goals. This meant that he needed time, space, and resources. So in order to for him to move forward, he had to find out exactly what these grieving adventurers needed. Ultimately, if he couldn’t do anything substantial, he would move on and take on new teammates compatible with his objectives.\nBy observing the adventurers, he pinpointed an opening in the form of an adventurer named “Brandon”, who was quiet and sitting with his arms resting against his hips. He looked contemplative, though carrying a frown on his fixed face.\nSitting down cautiously, Matthew glanced for any reactions from the other adventurers. When he didn’t see anything pronounced, he continued. “I’m sorry for your loss.”\n“Yeah,” Brandon said.\nAfter nodding thrice, Matthew waited for a continuation. When he didn’t get any, he glanced around again. When nothing particular happened, he resumed his planned approach. Particularly, he repeated a certain gesture. He would stare at Brandon and break off right before it reached that no-no point. This indicated his interest to hear him speak more.\nBrandon noticed this and made a slight, brief smile. “I don’t remember anymore.”\n“What?” Matthew understood from the tone, but it was more natural to ask.\n“I don’t remember what happened with us and how everything went. Where did it all mean?”\nMatthew understood a lot from that, so he kept quiet.\nOn a pragmatic level, he knew that Brandon could be a gateway to further interest among the adventurers in Matthew as a more realized member of the group. But this was merely hypothetical at the moment.\nBrandon continued, “I just liked her, you know. My mom. She would always say that I was mad, you know, for always being so sure of myself. Ha! I thought it was funny, too. But it wasn’t… funny… Hehe… I..” He snorted in a depressed manner. “I can’t speak right now, sorry.”\nMatthew stopped himself from shrugging and nodded. “Sure, it’s fine.” Instead of standing up, Matthew waited for the group to stop grieving before he left Brandon. Throughout this wait, he glanced around periodically for an opportunity to arise. However, once the adventurers parted ways, Matthew realized that this group didn’t align with his goals, and the effort involved in him helping them grieve would be too much for him emotionally. So this was a perfect time to leave.\nBefore he left, Deathbringer smiled weakly. “I think we’re going to take some time off.”\n“Okay,” Matthew said.\n“They’re saying we’re going to leave for good, but trust me.”\n“Okay. Okay.”\n“It’s going to be fine.”\n“Okay.”\n“You can come back again.”\n“Okay.”\nWhen Matthew left, he returned to the inn where new people and quests were currently. As for the nearby adventurer guild that mainly hosted the quests, this inn served as a subsidary for it.\nAt the inn, Matthew could identify many groups open to accepting “tag-alongs”, or independent agents or adventurers who wanted to tag along with them in their quests.\nTo illustrate, these groups numbered eight. Moreover, while most of these groups had two or more slots available, two groups only had one available space left. So he had to hurry.\nInstead of overthinking, he chose the nearest group, the one where the members wore two complementary colors. These colors were purple for their tunics and yellow for their surcoats. In addition, their surcoats featured their group symbol, a pig wearing a bandana.\nAs soon as he got accepted, Matthew transitioned quickly to the quest where he arrived at a remote forest location where they had to cross a river. In order to cross, they needed a boat; unfortunately, the river didn’t have a paddler and a canoe at a hut next to it. So since they didn’t really plan for this, they decided that they should return home to hire a paddler. Though, they didn’t know how the canoe was going to be carried to the wide river. Ultimately, when they finally got the canoe to the river by carrying it together, they realized that they didn’t really need the canoe. To explain, even if the river was strong in some parts, it was shallow, only reaching the waist.\nAs soon as they crossed the river, they got closer to the mountain where certain buffalos roamed. What they had to do was protect them for the whole day. As for why their contractors hired them instead of more permanent guards, they didn’t know.\nIn the meantime, they could hang out and give each other pointers on how to deal with threats in their current mountanous environment.\nThe adventurers who recruited Matthew only to tag along distanced themselves from him, leaving him in a helpless situation.\nMatthew ignored his emotional reaction against the adventurers, deciding to learn by observing his environment. If he could be just a little bit more alert and observant than his peers right now, then he would be able to assuage his concerns about their reliability. In other words, if he was one step ahead of them, he would understand them better.\nIndeed, Matthew’s patience paid off, as he was the first to notice a group of bandits heading by a dangerous, steeper route, using a form of magic to improve their climbing. He alerted the adventurers, saving them ten seconds of time.\nThis saved time enabled them to secure control of the best positions, signalling their advantage in vision and map control.\nAs soon as the fight began, the bandits were quickly eliminated since they were forced to face-check blind spots in order to proceed. Also, they trusted their sneakiness too much. This resulted in their swift defeat.\nDue to how successful this quest was, the adventurers smiled one by one.\nAs soon as they returned home, Matthew tucked himself inside an inn, and he checked his [System] once again and wondered if his contributions to the fight influenced his stats.\nName: Matthew Cruz\nSpecies: Human\nAge: 25\nSkills: None\nSpells: None / None\nVitality: 15\nQuests: None\nNice job rocking that fight! The gods are totally keeping an eye on you! 😇 Your reward? Way more XP than usual—12,000+!\n“The hell does that even mean—”\nName: Matthew Cruz\nLevel: 0 -\u003e 71\nCurrent experience: 433\nSpecies: Human\nAge: 25\nSkills: None\nSpells: None / None\nVitality: 15\nQuests: None\nHe burst into excited laughter. It was that satisfaction of finally succeeding after thinking that this entire operation was a loss. This entire world was beating down on him, and he made it out alive without so much of a scratch? He was laughing all the way in relief. This was his victory, and no one could take that away from him.\n“But this doesn’t make sense. Is 71 a high rank? Or is it actually low? And why isn’t my [Vitality] moving? I’m worried here. I haven’t grown up— Oh, wait, yeah, that doesn’t affect.\n“I hope this isn’t a bad thing. What skills do I get in return? How does this work?”\nSince the [System] stayed quiet, he exhaled tiredly and gave up for today, falling asleep.\nWhen he woke up, the daylight scared him for some reason. It was so bright that he briefly couldn’t see around the horizon, but when he moved his head, the sun rays moved out of the way enough for him to see some trees and houses. Though, that feeling of infinite expanse made him want to stay inside and process everything. “Why am I here? Who brought me here? Did God bring me here? God, please tell me I’m not crazy. If there’s a reason why I’m here, please tell me. I need things to make sense. Things are working out. I’m level 71! Ha! I don’t know… Is that enough? Is it enough for me to not go crazy? Am I going to die? I don’t even know what it’s like to be a child here? I’m like a foreigner stuck in some ancient land with magic. I just can’t pretend to know everything, so it should be okay if I sat down here. No one’s forcing me.”\nAfter staying in the inn for several days, he rejoined the purple-and-yellow group of adventurers on another quest, one that involved a dungeon invasion.\nMatthew, having regained some rejuvenation, felt that he needed some long-term alliances, so he hoped that he could prove himself to them in this upcoming mission. If his 71 levels meant anything, hopefully, he could learn to use a spear faster.\nAs soon as they arrived at the location, Matthew had time to relax, as the adventurers wanted to rest before marching into the dungeon. As for the reason of this, these dungeons could be very deep, wide, and labyrinthine and left little time to rest.\nChapter 4 - The Goblin’s Challenge: Matthew’s Slaying Spree linkIn the distance, Matthew watched several wild dogs hopping about, their bodies like contorted dancers in a danse macabre. These dogs were relatively normal-looking, but it was the way they moved that made him wince.\nAs the adventurers were resting, Matthew heard them discussing.\n“We should haul the machinery, but it would be difficult to have it passed under the sight of the guards. Do y’all think that it would be better off being hauled to the storage first?”\nMatthew still didn’t understand, and since the adventurers were more favorable toward him, he asked one of the adventurers who wasn’t busy: “What are they talking about?”\n“Golems,” said the adventurer, whose name was Mike. “They haven’t been able to get it out of the city because the authorities have been very strict with the movement of golems throughout the region. I heard that the authorities deemed it better to avoid another incident, so that’s why they were talking about putting it in a separate storage instead in the meantime because we’re being expected to move out by the end of the week.”\n“This week? Incident?”\n“No, no, I mean two weeks from now… The incident is the one where the goblins died due to a misunderstanding of the golem, remember?”\n“No, I didn’t know. I wasn’t living here until relatively recently.”\n“Ah, I see.”\nAfter listening for a while, Matthew reserved his energy for the mission.\nLater, when they finally got up and made their way to the dungeon entrance, the adventurers began raising their weapons and moving cautiously.\nA few steps into the dungeon, they noted the presence of goblin huts to the far left, a group of wild dogs to the right around a corner, and a loose group of giant humanoid deers eating vegetation all around the lush cave, among other minor threats.\nTen steps inside the dungeon, they noticed several goblins making their way up a slope toward an artificially created doorway that led to a corridor, several wild dogs glancing between the adventurers and each other, and humanoid deers climbing up the same slope the goblins climbed.\nFourteen steps into the dungeon, they triggered a series of events. Namely, the rest of the goblins in the huts went out and began snarling, and several dogs retreated to a darker area. Unrelated to this, humanoid deers unintentionally stood in the way of the doorway where the goblin had entered, blocking it.\nSince the goblins already had the advantage of location, they immediately reached for their arrows and shot at the adventurers, using their uphill advantage to stunt the adventurers in their movements. However, the adventurers were already in shield formation. Moreover, they were the first to fire, having thrown magical bombardments that pushed the goblins immediately out of their perfect spot. Since the goblins had no way of dealing with artillery, they strategically retreated up the slope toward the doorway. Yet the humanoid deers were blocking it. To make up for this very unlucky situation, the goblins shot arrows at the adventurers; however, the adventurers were so close that blocking the arrows with their shields was straightforward. Because of this, they were able to kill the goblins swiftly and easily, chasing them around the platform preceding the doorway.\nMike, the adventurer whom Matthew spoke to earlier, burst into laughter some time after the fight ended. “This is just like what I was telling you, Matthew! The faunthorn did the same thing the golem did!” He paused for a moment, and his tone became solemn. “They were in the middle of a search and rescue operation, so the goblin was trying to save people who got caught in a fire. But the golem of the owner of the building blocked the way, so the goblin died with the people he was trying to save.”\n“Ugh.” Matthew supposed that the “faunthorn” was the humanoid deer.\n“Yeah, it was horrible.”\n“By the way… there was an owner? Was it? What was it? Was it an inn?”\n“Yeah, it was.”\n“Which one?”\n“Block \u0026 Bed Tavern.”\n“Oh, I thought it was the inn I went to for a second.” Matthew rubbed his face, relieving some tension that the earlier fight gave him. After looking at the tired demeanors of the adventurers around him, he realized that he needed to rest.\nHe noticed the adventurers conversing again.\n“By the way,” said an adventurer named Ella, as she cleaned up some of the sticky remains of the goblins and put them in a basket to clean and prepare for selling later, “is Kairo attending today? I was supposed to give something. The… avocado he ordered from Echo.”\n“Ah, okay, sure,” said another adventurer named Nova. “Ah… I should… say that he hasn’t been talking a lot lately. So I’m not sure if he’s going to come, but can you ask… the person who he usually talks to.” He gave a knowing chuckle and gesture; though, his tone hinted at underlying discomfort. “Ada, Ella wanted to know if Kairo’s gonna be the one handling the flowers today. I know it’s not his responsibility, but you know… you did say he wanted to do it right?”\n“Yeah, he is kind of sick right now he said,” Ada said, giving a wincing smile. “I… haven’t really talked to him about it after that. So I should talk to him about it, yeah.”\nIn the meantime, Matthew didn’t understand the context behind what they were saying, but that was the same with most of what he had heard them say during his time with them.\nSince he was feeling a little uncomfortable, he checked his [System] again.\nName: Matthew Cruz\nLevel: 71\nCurrent experience: 433\nSpecies: Human\nAge: 25\nSkills: None\nSpells: None / None\nVitality: 15\nQuests: None\n“Are the goblins really that weak?” Matthew said, getting used to the existence of goblins and seeing them more analytically.\n“No, no, they’re just not being used effectively,” said an adventurer named “Prism” after he saw that the others were silent or in the middle of a conversation.\n“Really?” said Matthew quickly with surprise.\n“Yeah!” said Prism with sureness. “It’s the problem with not really having strategy. If there’s strategy, I’m telling you that the goblins… They actually have… Like, there’s a lot of things that they can do.”\n“Really?” said Matthew slowly and with intrigue.\n“Yeah! If you actually see the way they’re actually moving, they’re very smart in smaller-time movements, but they have no clue about how to orchestrate and… put together something that feels organized and large. They rely a lot on guerilla kind of tactics, so it’s not as effective as human armies. And humans have magic of course. We have lots of magic, and goblins are usually on the lesser side of artillery and the way we fight using range. They don’t have. They…. only have weapons that they make themselves, so they’re very dependent on that and independent. It’s… the way they organize in smaller groups that… really determines whether they instantly win a fight or they lose. So they could be compared to a special type of soldier that is very reliant on high-risk, high-reward. They’re not very well-rounded, so they’re only useful in a given set of situations, given their current level of skill. Of course, it would be a different story if they were given a lot more to work with like skills and other skills that… actually work.”\n“Oh, yeah, about, I actually saw the skill of one of the goblins. It was something like [Redbite] or something.”\n“Yeah, that’s a common skill. It actually… Well, it’s not so common, so you actually found a good one. Where did you… Was it here?”\n“No, it was… back there in the steps. The dungeon steps thing.”\n“Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it, I get it. That’s usually where they are a lot stronger. Well, depending on the time of day. So, if it’s night, you’ll find much more stronger monsters, and that’s also when they fight. When it’s daytime, they usually rely on monsters that can cope with the fire that… you know, where they burn. They don’t really have anything else to work it… I make it sound like they’re weak. If you’ve met goblin tamers, there… they will tell you that it’s actually the most strongest thing in the world! It… depends, of course, on the way you handle… your strategy. If you don’t have an effective strategy, you… will lose. But if you have an strategy that… accomodates that kind of fighting style, then you will be able to immediately just take over. It’s important to, kind of, just get used to goblins. If you don’t have a deep, strong understanding of the way they are, then you won’t be able to tame or imitate… their strategies. But that’s not the point. They don’t really have the best strategies. But they do have… They do serve a purpose. It’s complicated, I think, so if you find out, I think you’re going to study the way… Like, war studies. Or I mean in this case, it would be… goblin studies. But that’s really… It’s dependent on you. What is the feeling that makes you feel this… makes sense and feels good in… terms of effectiveness. Anyway…”\nAs a result of their conversation, Matthew felt a bottle of experience enter his lungs, a rejuvenative effect yielding a whirl of pops and flashes inside his head. Moreover, the enjoyment of a good conversation made it easier for him to calm down like a mother’s embrace. Lastly, having people who were willing to talk to him even if he was inexperienced brought him back to the present instead of wandering off in reflections too much, similar to a friendly tap on the shoulder. This was crucial for his sustained wellbeing and growth.\nFurthermore, tears of relief began to pour down Matthew’s face, but he was able to hide it well. As for the reason, the stress had been too much on him recently, and finding continued success made him feel gratefully surprised. Naturally, his crying action stabilized his emotions and stress levels, acting as an effective counterbalance to combat stress.\nAfter crying, Matthew smiled confidently, having addressed his stress smoothly. Moreover, he quickly returned to accompanying the adventurers as they walked home and ate at a cafe in the city, loosening the initial tension between him and them.\nThe next day, Matthew and the adventurers were asked to take on a quest that involved goblins again. But this time, they would be helping goblin workers bring rabbits into their enclosures. This would occur three days per week for 8 weeks, so the quest contractors decided to hire adventurers who could deal with the elements instead of hiring others who were specialized for this job. This came as a consequence of a trending notion that adventurers were the best labor pool because they spent most of their time fighting and traveling, making them more “physically fit” to do menial work than people who spent decades doing only that. Indeed, if the quest involved a slight risk to monster attacks, then the contractors could be considered valid in hiring adventurers instead of specialized individuals. However, they could have hired guards instead.\nWhen they arrived at the location, it was much easier to catch the rabbits with a skill called [Taunt], which forced them to attack the skill user. However, the rabbits were still fast, and [Taunt] had limited range. Moreover, the rabbits were smart enough to keep their distance after seeing their fellow rabbits get caught.\nHowever, it would still take a long time before they caught all the rabbits, so at the end of the day, they headed home. Matthew was not given too much responsibility, but he was learning the various paths and places since he was forced to walk everywhere.\nHowever, Matthew was asked to clean the dirt off a common essential magical farming tool called a “harvesting scepter”, removing parts off them in order to clean the dirt inside. Removing and reattaching them was a lengthy process.\nHaving idle time to think from time to time, he wanted to know more about jobs. So even if the goblins looked a little tired and cold, he gave them the benefit of the doubt and asked, “Excuse me, do you think… being a farmer is… easier when you think about other jobs like building, adventuring—like an adventurer—and other professions like… being a trader?”\n“It’s not necessarily a job. More so, it’s a life decision, and you need to be prepared. So I think you should consider just choosing whatever you want.”\nMatthew was disappointed to hear a safe answer, so he probed more. “Really? I heard farmers earned more than adventurers.” He didn’t really think about the Cunningham’s Law, but he was applying it out of experience and intuition anyway.\n“No, no. Adventurers are lucky in many aspects, but you know… it’s the effort that counts, and adventurers are really not the type to put in that kind of… quality.”\nThis response was more nuanced than a correct answer. It was defensive and likely biased, so Matthew’s application of Cunningham’s Law failed here.\nHowever, Matthew was willing to agree with him: “Yeah, adventurers do rely on some luck, and it can be much more unpredictable than being a farmer. That’s the challenge, though.”\n“Not really. I’ve seen farmers handle elements far worse and sudden than what adventurers do. And I’m not saying adventurers don’t fight big, strong monsters. I can’t handle that. I really can’t. It’s just that there’s an element of luck that comes into play more when you’re an adventurer than when you’re a farmer. So basically, the adventurers who’ve been on the job for a long have been blessed to have that kind of “things working well” kind of situation.”\n“I’d say that adventurers do risk their life though.”\n“No, no, they don’t because they win.”\n“W-what do you mean?” Matthew felt that showing a little annoyance was apt.\n“They ‘win’ because things work out for them. I’m talking adventurers. True ones. Those who do make it. I’m not saying that new adventurers are not trying or not true adventurers. I’m saying that they win. They win because they… that’s just who they are.”\n“I don’t understand.”\n“That’s the thing. Farmers understand this kind of stuff a lot, and seeing that you’re an adventurer, I can see why you might struggle to see what I see. I’m not saying you’re dumb. I’m just saying you have limitations.”\nMatthew felt that the goblin’s argument was lopsided already, so he concluded the argument with a simple, polite “Okay.”\nThe goblin nodded, glancing away.\nAs soon as the adventurers finished, Matthew left with them.\nMany days later, he remembered his stats, and since it had been his third week in this world, he was given a random quest by the [System].\nQuest: Goblin Slaying Spree\nObjective: Eliminate 5 goblins within the next 50 minutes.\nReward:\n- Experience Points (XP) Boost\n- Rare Loot Drop Chance Increase\n- Gold Coins\n- Exclusive Goblin Slayer Title\nMatthew responded with a brilliant smile.\nChapter 5 - Goblin Slayer’s Odyssey: From Poster to Quests and Unraveling Magic linkDays ago, as he was traveling around the city on one of his many free days, he noticed a poster on a building that showed a colored drawing of a goblin and words that read: “Kill Goblins, Get Money.” The goblin was smirking and holding two knives with his arms crossed.\nSo, since he had spent so much time just exploring, he decided to do something independently and asked the person at the counter inside the building. It was a small house where a guy was combining metal with dead goblin heads and body parts.\nMatthew’s eyes widened briefly.\n“What’s this?” he said.\n“Have you got goblins?” said the metal guy. “I haven’t been getting much recently after they put the tariff on them. It’s sad, but most of my clients come from far out. So do you have goblins?”\n“No. I was wondering exactly about the process—”\n“Kill goblins, get money. Simple.”\n“Okay. How much?”\n“Depending on the goblin, let’s say I’ll give you 1 gold coin for every goblin.”\n“That doesn’t sound great.”\n“No, it is. Just look at everyone else. The problem is people don’t want to get their hands dirty since I’m a golem maker.”\n“Golem maker? I don’t see stone—”\n“Stone? I don’t work with stone. I work with these bodies and turn them into workable golems. It’s the same thing really. I just prefer this method because it aligns with my idea that life is reused. It’s the cycle of life, my friend. Anyway, have you got goblins to work with?”\n“No…”\n“I mean, do you have a playground or something where you hunt right now? If not, I suggest take the path down there toward the big line of forest trees. Yeah, that’s the best place to hunt. It has no name right now, but I call it a goblin zone. If you’ve wondering whether this is true or not, just check it yourself. And once you find out that I’m right, it’s my past experience, you know. I used to hunt goblins, but I was never good at combat. It’s not preference. I don’t like fighting. I don’t like killing. I don’t like war. It’s all too ‘ugh’ to me. So just check the place, and usually, it’s empty. But sometimes, you get lucky ‘cause that where goblins like to pass in groups. They go there in many numbers, and it’s because of that that I used to really ramp up levels. And that’s why I’m so consistent, you know, with my golem-making. I pour it all into this.”\n“Oh, yeah, uh, do you know about that? I didn’t want to tell anybody, but since you’re a third party, do you know what 71 levels mean?”\n“Oh, wow, that’s almost as much as I got in a year when I was still hunting. What did you do?”\n“I don’t know. I was watched by the gods?”\n“That’s not weird, but why did you get 71 levels?”\n“I don’t know. Maybe, I was given it in a whim?”\n“I guess so, but seriously, tell your friends. Go hunt. I need a party that can just… do the hunting for me. It’s boring, tiring. And I’d rather just have someone else do it, please.”\n“How haven’t you found anyone else?”\n“They don’t want to do hunting if nothing really happens there. It’s practically empty for the most part, and I think they just want that kind of shit. It’s rarely a good hunting spot, but if you know the schedule of the goblins by heart, you’ll catch them. If not, it’s a 5-second window. If you’re not there by that 5-second window, you’re better off catching rabbits.”\n“I am actually.”\n“Well, you’re better off… hunting there in the usual ‘Beginner’s Grounds,’ yeah.”\n“What’s that?”\n“The big circle where the adventurers have spots in each part of the circle.”\n“Oh, that. They changed the name I guess.”\n“Um, no. It’s just a… veteran thing.”\n“Okay,” he said with a growing polite smile that hinted at his suspicion. Indeed, a secret goblin spot where goblins travelled sometimes in groups felt too good to be true. If goblins were that predictable, then adventurers would be hounding that every second of everyday. It didn’t make sense unless the golem maker was leading unsuspecting adventurers to a trap, especially considering that he emphasized a specific time window. So he might be selecting this specific time in order to make it easiest for the goblins to ambush.\n“Ah, okay,” the golem maker said. “Either way, just find someone else. Thanks.”\nDays later, when Matthew told his adventurer party about this discussion, they decided to risk it by heading to the place together, considering the time and day specified by the golem maker.\nThe golem maker explained enough to convince the adventurers that it was worth risking.\nAs a result, they travelled to the vicinity of the destination hours and days earlier than the time and day specified. As they neared the destination, the adventurers began placing invisible wards, which granted vision, and magically sweeping the area of enemy wards. Moreover, they communicated constantly to each other regarding bushes, tight corners, and choke points.\nHowever, when they realized that their level of preparation was too little for the potential threat they faced, they collaborated with the adventurer guild. Then, the guild, in an official capacity, offered an incentive for adventurer parties who frequented in the morning to join the quest.\nSeveral adventurer parties, including that which Deathbringer had joined, met Matthew and his party at a cafe.\nMatthew approached him and engaged in some light small talk before asking him if he wanted to go outside while the rest were eating. When Deathbringer joined him outside, Matthew said: “Deathbringer, I want to say thanks for saving me.”\nDeathbringer looked down briefly before looking around, a subtle sadness in his face. He chuckled weakly. “It’s good that you’re doing well.”\nMatthew nodded continuously before he slowed down. “Do you want to join me?”\n“Uh… it’s hard for me to say.” Deathbringer offered a brief, weak smile.\n“Okay, that’s alright.”\nAs soon as the adventurer parties finished eating, they discussed about their plan before heading to the destination at the exact requested day but hours before the specified time. The wards Matthew’s party placed here last time detected two goblins. So the adventurers immediately began placing wards and sweeping the area of enemy wards, reaching farther than last time.\nLater, they noticed something: a hiding group of goblins.\nHaving been detected, hundreds of goblins attacked them head-on, and Matthew received his first quest. This came after three weeks passed since he came to this world.\nQuest: Goblin Slaying Spree\nObjective: Eliminate 5 goblins within the next 50 minutes.\nReward:\n- Experience Points (XP) Boost\n- Rare Loot Drop Chance Increase\n- Gold Coins\n- Exclusive Goblin Slayer Title\nMatthew responded with a brilliant smile.\nHe used a spear and struck a goblin, his heart pumping, his face terrified, but a smile flapping its wings on his face.\nSweet takedown on that goblin! You just earned yourself a cool 1+ XP for that win! 🎉\nHe, next to shields all over, grabbed a falling goblin and shoved it against the ground, locking it in place.\nHowever, he was slow, and the goblin bit and scratched Matthew’s body continuously.\nBefore the goblin could kill Matthew, one of the adventurers stabbed a spear against the goblin’s neck.\nLoss Condition:\nIf the player fails to eliminate 5 goblins within the specified time limit of 50 minutes, the quest will be considered failed.\nConsequences of Failure:\nThe player will not receive the Experience Points (XP) Boost.\nThe Rare Loot Drop Chance Increase will not be granted.\nGold Coins promised as a reward will not be given.\nThe Exclusive Goblin Slayer Title will not be earned.\nMatthew saw the beauty of tens of spells being launched at once, while the goblins shot volleys from a distance. In the crossfire, a hundred goblins died. Since the battle was systematic and organized in the adventurers’ favor, not a single adventurer died in this crossfire.\nEven when this happened, goblins and adventurers outside of the artillery and volley’s area of effect continued to fight.\nMatthew took advantage of the goblins’ chaos and confusion, killing four more heavily wounded goblins.\nAwesome goblin-slaying skills, adventurer! Your relentless assault on those four goblins deserves major kudos. Brace yourself for a whopping 4+ XP—consider it your well-earned reward for triumphing over those mischievous creatures! 🌟\nAfter this battle ended and the adventurers had time to clean up, rest, and discuss the distribution of profits, the golem maker who started this whole fiasco was brought into question and executed.\nIn the meantime, Matthew noticed his body growing more fit as time passed, especially considering how weak and exhausted he felt. He couldn’t move around much for the next week, so he rested. Thus, he didn’t receive payment for the rabbit quest.\nA week later, he immediately contacted 6 adventurers from the several parties that had collaborated with the goblin quest.\nHe met them and discussed about personal lives, but soon, the topics shifted to their goals and challenges.\nWhen Matthew discovered that one of the adventurers needed help managing a goblin worker shop, he offered himself for the job.\nBefore he began working there, he was told that they needed a specialist in handling employee relations.\nIt was a complicated role, but Matthew’s past experiences and knowledge on Earth equipped him for this job.\nAs soon as they accepted him, he earned much more than he did as an adventurer, and soon, he could hire an adventurer to kill goblins for him.\nHowever, since he had certain buffs on him, a week after he got his new job, he joined a quest with his party.\nBut first, he assessed the rewards he got for the goblin quest.\n🏆 Quest Completed: Goblin Slaying Spree\nCongratulations, brave adventurer!

Fellow adventurers and NPCs alike now recognize your prowess as a formidable Goblin Slayer. Your reputation as a skilled warrior is on the rise!\nAnd he checked his stats.\nName: Matthew Cruz\nLevel: 71 -\u003e 72\nCurrent experience: 66\nSpecies: Human\nAge: 25\nSkills: None\nSpells: None / None\nVitality: 15\nQuests: None\nTitles: [Goblin Slayer]\nAlso, he learned from his conversation with the 6 adventurers that levels could be exchanged for weapon, tool, and armor enchantments and repairs.\nWhen he met his party, he arranged a discussion with them about his contributions and potential. He explained one significant concern: the reason he was slow to intergrate well enough to understand levels and other related essentials was because of several problems. One, his displacement was significant initially. Two, he didn’t spend enough time with his first adventurer party to become tenured, and the sudden switch to a new one was disorienting, since many plans were abandoned in the first one. Three, he was naturally being expected to contribute as well as someone who grew up in this city did, so it was very stressful, even if the quests could be considered relatively easy.\nHe mentioned his new stats, title, level, and [Vitality], so he wanted to invest and risk his personal information being leaked to gain their trust.\nSo the adventurers offered suggestions.\nTournament, training, and joining the army were three suggestions that got his attention, because they entailed a more challenging life filled with constant combat stress. Living life as a lowly adventurer entering dungeons and seizing control of various minor locations from monsters sounded safer and more rewarding.\nWhen Matthew said that adventuring was the only option in his mind at the moment, the adventurers educated him on spells and skills before they moved on toward the quest.\n“If you want to know our spells in detail,” said one of the adventurers, Nova, “you should sign this magical contract not to share it to others outside this party. This agreement also will come with a new set of clothes for you to wear, that being our lavender-purple and mustard-yellow theme. I should also mention that there are a lot of things you need more besides this, but this is good enough. The reason for that is because you’ve been very patient, and we’re glad that you came to us to talk. Yeah, basically. That’s something I’ve been saying for a while now to… Ella and Ada. They’ve been talking about… They’ve been concerned that you wouldn’t be handle it since you’ve been pushing yourself. So I’m glad that you aren’t feeling too uncomfortable with us. So thanks… or welcome… in other words.”\nNova gestured to Ella for her to speak next.\n“Yeah, basically what he said,” said Ella. “I know… I know it’s weird that, especially with what happened”—she chuckled politely—” with Jayce and Richard.” She glanced at Nova and the other adventurers knowingly. “They haven’t been able to do it like you. You’ve been very committed, really.” She furrowed her brows in emphasis.\n“Do I have potential?” Matthew said in a perfunctory tone.\n“Yeah, you have potential, I can see it. You have potential. You’ve been working, so it’s… fair that we… You can ask… any questions, as long as it’s within our capabilities, yes.”\n“Okay.” He signed the magical contract Ella handed him after he read it. “What are your spells? Can I see your stats somehow?”\n“Yes, we can share with you. Of course, you cannot see our stats unless you have [Identify]. That’s obvious, but I’m guessing that since you’re asking about spells… you don’t know. So you can easily use [Identify] on goblins without really thinking about or even the word [Identify]… Anyway… here it is.”\nName: Ella Shadowblade\nLevel: 10\nCurrent experience: 25\nSpecies: Human\nAge: 28\nSkills: [Whispering Breezes], [Glimmering Spark], [Mirthful Tinkling], [Fleeting Shadow]\nSpells: None / None\nVitality: 30\nQuests: None\nTitles: [Whisperer of Elms], [Arcane Trinket Tracker], [Realm Drifter’s Scribe]\nMatthew stared, his eyes serious, putting his hand against his mouth, his nails pressing his lower lip.\nSince he had been mostly putting off his thoughts for the meantime to focus on physical challenges and following his party, he realized that this was the best time to return to an analytical and systematic approach.\nTo execute this approach, he would need to comprehend the world on a systematic level. This meant that he had to lay down all the groundwork first in terms of the various building blocks of society. Specifically, anything related to magic concerned him, since he already had a grasp of society based on Earth. To phrase it differently, it was the nuances of magic and they impacted society that eluded him.\nTo lay out the groundwork, he considered the basis of spells and how they were summoned. He didn’t need the science of their origin, but he wanted to know the science of how they were used by various actors and in diverse situations.\nSo he remembered his first encounter with magic, that being the healing that saved him from death. If he could count the number of seconds it took for magic to heal him and the pattern it followed, his Earth knowledge might point him to something significant.\nThis was the first step, so he contacted Deathbringer through two adventurers he knew from his party. After getting into contact with him, he asked about the healer who had saved him, Sophia, and how he could find her. Deathbringer then guided him to Sophia.\nFrom there, he inquired into her particular experience with healing and learned two.\nOne, he learned that in battle, it took usually 30 seconds to two minutes to heal someone, depending on the extent of their injuries.\nTwo, he learned that the pattern of healing looked like a timelapse video with skin and tissue appearing suddenly where they were supposed to be.\nThree, learning how to heal involved a ritual type of quest of being kind to one’s enemies.\nWhen Sophia finished talking about healing, before she left, she said something that caught his attention: “I haven’t forgotten. What you said that day.”\nMatthew ignored that and focused on his next concerns. Now that he learned about healing, he wanted to learn how to heal himself, so he took the next steps to getting the kindness quest Sophia had mentioned.\nAccording to Sophia, he had to pick up 200 flowers, 200 leaves, 200 fruits, and 200 vegetables without swearing. As he executed this series of actions, he doubted himself many times.\nBut as soon as he was finished, the [System] finally handed him the kindness quest.\nQuest: Kindness Unleashed\nObjective: Embark on a journey to spread kindness throughout the world. Complete the following tasks within the next 60 minutes:\n- Healing Touch: Offer aid to three injured beings, whether they be mystical creatures, wandering adventurers, or distressed spirits.\n- Nature’s Embrace: Plant seeds of benevolence in three different locations to encourage the growth of vibrant, magical flora.\n- Melodic Serenity: Use a musical instrument to create a calming melody that resonates through the troubled areas, soothing both creatures and the environment.\n- Wisdom Sharing: Engage in meaningful conversations with wise entities or beings, exchanging insights and kindness to uplift their spirits.\nReward:\n- Experience Points (XP) Boost for embodying the essence of compassion and empathy.\n- Rare Loot Drop Chance Increase as a result of the positive energy infused into your being.\n- Gold Coins bestowed upon you by the grateful entities touched by your acts of kindness.\n- A mysterious token, imbued with magic, symbolizing your commitment to the cause of spreading goodwill.\n“My goodness… This is so… I should be surprised, really, but at this point, I don’t even know. It is what it is, huh. I’ve already reached the point where I’m normal with this now.” He laughed.\nChapter 6 - Strategic Maneuvers: Unraveling the Hobgoblin Menace linkIn the distance of a bright city, an older man walked the streets, a heavy smile on his face. Wherever he walked, he paved the way for future generations, and his dreams would outlast him. But that was life. “How long has it been?” he said, reflecting through thousands of memories. The bitterness that came from the pains of the past and the weakness he experienced now combined, but they were counterbalanced by the beauty and times of joy he experienced throughout his life. It was like swallowing the sweetest drink in the company of over a thousand friends, accompanied by the destruction of worlds in the background. In short, days and years become dusty carpets through art. And soon enough, that art would be emulated by those who didn’t know the context behind it. That process repeated itself until the memories symbolizes by that very simple art piece disappeared and faded away, having their impact resting through dirt and earth. Gone were the days of old.\nTo everyone else, he would remain a background character forever more, even if he might have been somebody at one point.\nMatthew passed by him, only sparing him a brief look, before he turned around and glanced at the man again. “Excuse me, my name is Matthew. I work as an adventurer part time, but I mainly work in employee relations. Anyway, I wanted to ask if there was anything you’d like to see fixed or… improved?”\n“Everything is good enough,” said the older man, “but if you want things to get better, you can try that tree.”\n“What?”\n“That tree could be helped by just letting it be.”\n“What… But maybe the tree needs pruning or something?”\n“No, just let it be and rest next to it. That’s enough.”\n“Okay.” He decided to stay next to the tree the whole day, spending 6 hours alternating between stretching, standing around, walking, and sitting on his haunches.\nAfterwards, he stood up and had a feeling that he completed one of the requirements of his quest. He didn’t try to question it too much, since it would be like arguing with a child. That was counterproductive. Instead of arguing with a child, it was best to support their imaginations with a healthy balance of truth and creativity. The obligation of the truth was not to limit or hinder progress. This was why creativity counterbalanced the idea that limitations and impossibilities were set in matter-of-fact stone.\nSo he trusted the quest to guide him to a place that he would never truly understand. But he would try to make sense of it on his own level as effectively as possible.\nAs soon as he completed the kindness quest, he headed straight to Deathbringer,\nDeathbringer gave him some advice on how to proceed, reflecting on previous battles with goblins. “Now, I’m an adventurer, not a team leader. So if you’re going to ask for how to win, better ask Michel. She was the closest to our former late leader.”\nMatthew pressed him for advice, asking specific questions: “What are the strategies often used to fight goblins?”\n“It depends. Depending on the goblin community, there are different strategies to beating them. It also depends on how skilled they are in fighting or how good they are at strategy. If they’re bad at strategy, then abuse that by taking high-risk, high-reward moves that wouldn’t work against more decently strategic goblins. It’s a matter of gauging their level of skill in fighting and strategy and the type of community they grew up in.”\nIncidentally, part of Matthew wanted to be snarky and say: “Makes sense. But why the hell are you saying this?” However, he was not that type of person, since real life was not about the overly snarky, wry, and witty persona. Often times, just being a normal human being with social skills instead of coming across as antagonistic and dismissive was more effective.\nAs a whole, curbing certain sides of himself and promoting others depending on the situation was essential to his pragmatic approach.\nTo explore this idea further, the best adventurers knew to stop fighting and back off instead of overextending due to greed or ego, even if backing off required being treated as the weaker side and being humiliated to maintain a specific rational strategy, sometimes involving looking weak when one was strong. Similarly, learning to communicate through silence when communicating through speaking was ineffective determined success in the long-term. Moreover, listening to others didn’t just involve repeating insincere yesses like a yes man, as it involved appropriating what someone else said and echoing it with added nuance, whether it be that of disagreement or agreement. To sum, integrating strategic thinking, humility, adaptability, and effective communication were key elements in achieving success in navigating complex situations.\nAfter finishing up talking with Deathbringer, he came to the cottage of a person named “Michel.”\n“Hello?” said Matthew, having traveled uphill for an hour before he arrived.\nMichel opened the door. “Matt, I’m surprised you thought I was home.”\n“He told me about your new rule.”\n“Oh, oh, I see.”\n“Why didn’t you contact me? I haven’t heard from you at all until now. Busy? Did Sophia bully you into funding her coffee farm project?” She laughed.\n“I’m sorry. I was just getting used to surviving and adapting to my new circumstances in this city.”\n“Okay, that’s fine, as long as you’re good, but tell me. Did Deathbringer tell you about me? He hasn’t talked to me either, and I’m wondering whether he’s leaving for good.”\n“He’s in a new group.”\n“Oh, so did Deathbringer tell you to come here for questions?”\n“Yeah, something like that.”\n“I had a feeling.” She grinned toothily. “He was the closest to you. I saw.”\n“Yeah.”\n“Why don’t you want to come in? Come on, sit down. I haven’t forgotten your promise to atone for us saving you. I still remember you crying.”\n“…Hey…” Matthew was embarrassed.\n“Have you visited Sophia already?”\n“No. Yes. She helped me learn healing.”\n“Really? That’s good, that’s good. So can you heal this?”\nShe showed a very large black spot on her arm.\n“What!”\n“It’s fine, it’s fine. Just heal it. I got it today, and I think it’s dangerous.”\nAfter Matthew healed it, Michel stared at him and smiled for ten seconds, causing Matthew to glance away. “How are you?” she said. “I don’t think you’re okay, are you?”\n“I wasn’t… But I think I’m fine now—”\n“Good!” Michel gave a thumbs-up with a manly proud smile.\nMatthew brought her to his level of seriousness. “Was that the reason… you decided to have that rule about not going outside?”\n“What?”\n“The…” Matthew pointed to his arm, referring to the black thing that was on her arm earlier.\n“No, it was because of that.” She was referring to the death of many of her fellow adventurer members.\n“Ah…”\n“It’s about time that you leave because I’m sick. I’m actually not okay, and I haven’t been taking time to take care of myself until now. I was busy helping the rest of the group move on, but to be honest, I’m not okay. I am not… okay.”\nMatthew nodded in understand and left, heading to meet the six adventurers that he contacted earlier.\nHe managed to fit all the meetings in a day because he had the funding to use fast giant lizards to travel. The reason it all had to be all on one day was because he only had days before his third quest, and he wanted to be ready.\nWhen he met his adventurer contacts, he convinced them to collaborate on a job. This was easy since he was already on very good terms with one of these adventurers, who was his co-worker at the goblin worker shop. The other adventurers were also on good terms due to Matthew’s past willingness to listen to them about their personal struggles, goals, and challenges and share his helpful thoughts. Indeed, his experience on Earth with teams and college requirements made it easier for him to connect to people faster on a personal level.\nAs for the job, it related to compiling information from his written notes and discussing them in detail for the next week. This would prepare him for the “exam” of taking on his second [System] quest.\nAfterwards, he turned to his adventurer party and summarized what he had discussed during the day. Fishing for their valuable feedback, advice, and different viewpoints was his goal here. In the event that his second upcoming quest was revealed to be too difficult, they were his first responders.\nOn the day that his quest came, it felt as if the sounds of heaven graced the earth, releasing fumes of negative energy forming a figure in the distant fog. This figure soon became clear.\nQuest: Hobgoblin Menace\nObjective: Hunt down and eliminate the hobgoblin named “Mawkery” within the next 72 hours, as he poses a serious threat. He has mastered the art of blending in with human society and has already claimed the lives of several warlords.\nReward:\nExperience Points (XP) Boost\nIncreased Chance of Rare Loot Drops\nGold Coins\nExclusive Hobgoblin Slayer Title\nSpeaking of which, meanwhile, far away, Mawkery was standing among a group of bandits behind a giant bandit leader who barked at a group of adventurers.\nMoments later, he killed the leader from behind and distanced himself toward the adventurers.\nEarlier, during the barking confrontation, he killed one of the remote bandits, appropriated his hood and accessories, and sneaked into the group from behind, and blended among them, his secretive clothing having hidden most of his green skin.\nReturning to Matthew, he laughed at the time limit of 72 hours. “This is great,” he said sarcastically before he turned serious. “Oh my gosh…”\n“I didn’t… I didn’t know…” He stared at the wall of his inn room for a few seconds.\n“Why!” he whispered. “Why! I don’t… I don’t… I don’t…” He sneezed before he lowered his shoulders and looked down.\nHe looked up, rubbed his mouth and chin, and began sliding his upper teeth against one nail.\nSeated, he lowered his arms and pressed them against his stomach, bending downward, clasping his hands together. “I don’t know…” He chuckled softly.\nWhen he refocused on the sun, he thought for a moment. As time passed, he remembered memories from Earth. In the end, he felt a sense of confidence knowing that he lived fulfilled on Earth. “I won! I won… I… won…”\nHowever, he began to feel a blending of emotions.\n“I can’t be here… I can’t be here!” His voice was a whisper, but he was serious.\nAfter idling sleepily for numerous minutes, he lay down.\nSince he had been pushing himself so much this past week, it was already 5 AM when he fell asleep with satisfaction.\nWhen he woke up, he got up quickly and presumed that 8 hours had passed since he fell asleep.\nHowever, he lay back down again because he was still sleepy. It took ten minutes before he went outside.\nOutside, Matthew already knew what to do. First, with the help of his adventurer contacts, he gathered crucial information about hobgoblin activities, recent encounters, and frequented locations. Next, he approached locals, compiling rumors and insights that might reveal Mawkery’s whereabouts. Third, he analyzed patterns from Mawkery’s recent attacks and interviewed survivors, piecing together details about the elusive hobgoblin.\nFourth, Matthew sought advice from experts familiar with hobgoblins and their behavior.\nAs information flowed in, Matthew meticulously developed a strategic plan. At the same time, he formed a coalition of many adventurer parties, thanks to the help of the government, as they provided the experts and the promised rewards for completing this Mawkery quest.\nIn order to manage information, he had hired scribes record, transcribe, and organize them, professional writers who could record and transcribe on the fly. Their fees were high, so with the help of leaders of his former adventurer coalition contacted through the six adventurers, he received subsidies from the government for the scribes. Moreover, the government declared that they would lend state scribes so that they could monitor the performance more directly.\nWith the influence of the scribes, Matthew knew well that his prior experience, education, relationships, the urgent quest deadline, and his own personal growth all contributed to him becoming hyper strategic. His systematic information gathering, methodogical planning, and connection harnessing to try and defeat Mawkery reflected this. In conclusion, he was well aware that his resourcefulness and leadership skills had kicked into high gear.\nChapter 7 - Decisions and Consequences: Unraveling the Threads of War link“Matthew, what the hell are you doing? Have you been taking care of yourself? What’s happening now?”\nMatthew heard his mother talking to him from afar, but it was only his imagination. Even if he had healing, a part of him was beginning to feel grief. He knew that all this success would give him time to process his emotions more, and it hurt like he was being axed apart by a minotaur.\nBut he was okay now, since he had to keep moving forward. His lack of sleep made it harder for him to think about anything else but his goals.\nHe stared at the horizon, finding that he finally had some power, but he wasn’t sure. Something itched at the back of his mind. This ominous feeling reminded him of what he felt before he was transported from Earth to this new world. He couldn’t trust that things would work out easily, so he had to hedge the situation. If he won, that would be Plan A. If he lost, then at least he invested in friends that could support him if everything fell apart.\nHe shook his head, sitting down at the back of a giant crowd sitting down in front of a preacher. This preacher was detailing the adventurers about the power that goblins held as threats to human life and why they had to be vanquished. This was different from the pep talk of a general or commander. This suffused murderous zeal into human sponges.\nIn the meantime, in a tent nearby, the king of Matthew’s city state watched Mawkery in an orb. “How much did we invest into this?” he said rhetorically, smiling knowingly at his three best soldiers at the corner, while a man with a cautious gait entered the tent. “What did we learn?”\n“The dragon is flying up ahead,” said the man who had entered, rubbing the outer side of his arm, glancing around as if he was analyzing the structure of the tent. “Mawkery has been befriending dragons as well. When did this even happen? It’s a good thing we prepared for artillery, so the magic shield should withstand the dragon’s onslaught. So please come with me. I shall you the podium where you can cast [Gloomcore].”\n“Right… so please stand on the podium please. We don’t want you repeating that again.”\n“You’re right. It’s been so lucky this day. I’ve been having soup twice a day compared to when usually, my stomach would just not allow for that.”\n“Yeah, haha. But seriously, is the Gloomcore seventy percent accurate at least?”\n“Yes, it has an accuracy rate of 70% as said here. But correct the lens if needed. I’ve been casting too much spells related to diarhhea lately, hehe.”\n“Enough, Your Majesty.”\n“Right. Let’s go…” He took a deep breath and cast the spell [Gloomcore], striking down the dragon in an instant with a beam of magic powered by negative emotion. This beam shifted between the colors violet, black, dark red, and green, ending with white feathery particles.\nAwesome job slaying that dragon! You’ve just earned yourself a whopping 12,000 XP! 🐉💥 Keep up the epic victories!\nThe king smirked with his whole face, his wrinkles forming the darkest shadows.\nName: King Aethelred III\nSpecies: Human\nAge: ?\nSkills: ?\nSpells: ? / ?\nVitality: ?\nCatching the attention of the crowd, he walked back toward his tent and saw Matthew sitting down, but he wasn’t informed of his significance, only sparing him a glance.\nMeanwhile, Matthew covered his face with both hands before he smiled, composed.\nBased on inference, he immediately noted the surprising bad decision Mawkery made in sending his dragon. Mawkery acted recklessly when he ignored the likely event of the dragon getting killed by the spell of the king or some other spell that the king’s mages had prepared. So he wondered if Mawkery secretly hid some condition that became fulfilled on the death of the dragon. He also wondered if external pressures led Mawkery to make this bad decision. Basically, because Mawkery had been consistently strategic and successful, a sudden decision to throw away something as powerful as a dragon was unbelievable to Matthew.\nMoreover, his concerns were shared by those around him. Though, their solutions were different, as a team of soldiers were already on their way to check the downed dragon.\nMatthew was now also confused by how straightforward the soldiers were. Therefore, he had to understand exactly what was going on, since the inner workings involved in magic and sociopolitical dynamics could be very complex. If he was left behind in the dust, then he would struggle to cope with situations that required a more nuanced solution. He was lucky to have survived until now, but moving forward required a more adaptable approach. This rested on knowledge and experience, which he lacked, considering that the actions of Mawkery and the soldiers bewildered him.\nAs soon as the soldiers reached the dragon, the dragon exploded, burning the soldiers alive.\nMatthew was grabbing his head. He wondered why the King decided to let the soldiers approach the dragon in the first place if there was a chance of a counterattack.\nThe King and Mawkery made costly decisions that could have been easily avoided, and Matthew wanted to know why.\nHe shifted his focus to another concern and asked two familiar adventurers next to him: “Why are we not moving?”\n“What?” said one of the adventurers, Desmond Leroy, his face scarred.\n“Why are we just watching them?” said Matthew, maintaining his gaze even after Desmond had tilted his head toward him.\n“We have to be patient. If we’re not patient, then we will easily die.”\n“No, but… in this situation, I feel that it would be better if we kept moving and separated to… you know… focus on certain objectives than if we stayed here… in this spot.”\n“Okay, first off, this is not the whole army.”\n“I mean, yeah. I’m just saying that we shouldn’t stay here, you know.”\n“Why do you say that?”\n“Why should we waste time watching the dead dragon when we should be moving?”\n“The dragon could be holding secrets that might be useful.”\n“Do we need—”\n“Just watch. Commander Mishop is going to speak.”\nMishop stared at the adventurers, his gaze passing by Matthew and the two adventurers, and he said: “We should be patient.”\n“See,” said Desmond.\n“We should be strong,” continued Mishop. “We should also never forget what matters the most. We should not let this wicked creature take a hold of us.”\n“Is he a preacher?” said Matthew.\n“He used to be, like Bishop Dan,” said Desmond. “But he’s been recently replaced by another, so now he’s been chosen to be a representative for the adventurers.”\n“Ah, what is that? Representative?\n“He basically is the middle man between the state and the adventurer parties. He’s like an event organizer.”\n“Okay, okay. Will he be troubling—with us?”\n“Yeah, I heard that he was going to be supporting us with bishop magic.”\n“Ah, that’s good then.”\n“How is that different from an guild leader in, like, a guild for adventurers and that?”\nDesmond was already talking with a group of adventurers, so Matthew couldn’t get his answer. He looked over at other nearby adventurers, but they were either busy or looked disinterested and tired.\nEven if Matthew didn’t get the answers he expected, he still learned a lot from Desmond, feeling more at ease with him. Though, from what he saw, Desmond had his own group, and they didn’t seem so approachable to let him mingle with them. So he waited for the adventurers to start moving again.\nTen hours later, after gazing and listening around and getting a much better idea of the different dynamics and conversations of adventurers, the adventurers were then made to begin marching. This included Matthew, who was still confused why the King had them wait for ten hours if nothing was happening from what he could see.\nBefore this, he was going through the motions, but now that he was idly marching, he could process the past events fully.\nFor one, he remembered a conversation he had with Sophia. Since it was crucial for closure and he trusted Sophia, he told her that he came from another world. He started it off with “Well, um, I see that there’s something bothering you.” He was referring to Sophia’s concerns with goblins and how it was much more difficult for her to visit the village along with Marcher.\nSophia replied, “What you said earlier about giving them food and water and other goods is a good idea. We can probably try to get the guild of crafters to consider that. But again, the goblins are not entirely safe-to-be-around. They’re considerably problematic when you take into account the fact that they’re not… they haven’t been… conversational with us since Lepher.”\nReturning to the present, Marcher nodded before he looked at Deathbringer, who was also marching next to him. “They said you should show yourself to the King only after you’ve proposed the plan to the coalition leaders.”\n“Yeah…” Matthew said, wanting to say more, but he knew that Deathbringer didn’t really align with his ideas about handling Mawkery. Even if Matthew was instrumental, many could have done what he did better in terms of gathering information, and many did that already. So, even if he was the earliest to discover Mawkery due to the [System] quest, he was also overlooked to some degree, and that was even more obvious with the way that the coalition leaders were slowing down their support for Matthew and prioritizing the war and pleasing the King. Pleasing the King meant getting more active in the war. Getting more active in the war equated to influence and profits. So he had to keep his head down for now while the established leaders acted, since he was an outsider and a newbie to begin with.\nSince he could not do anything, he remembered what he said next in the I’m-from-another-world conversation: “Who’s Lepher? Anyway, doesn’t matter.” His used a rhetorical tone. “Who are the goblins again? You know these goblins could be anybody… willing to take what they want, grab what they want.”\n“Yeah,” Sophia said, her posture still and extrospective. “And they did that multiple times with Jill’s farm”\nMatthew was sitting down with one leg atop another, his legs crossing, elbows resting on a table, right arm gesturing, left arm massaging and grabbing his hair or supporting the side of his head. His body and head was tilted downward toward the table, but his eyes maintained contact with Sophia. “But what I’m saying is the goal here is that we should at least try to consider everything. What do the goblins want? Instead of assuming what they want, can we send someone well-versed with the goblins.”\nSophia adjusted her blouse a little with one hand.“We already contacted someone from the adventurer guild, but they’re not ‘open’.”\nMatthew rubbed his forehead and brows with his non-dominant hand. “Okay, but the issue here is that you guys as non-state adventurers is that you guys rely too much on assumptions since you guys don’t have all the information already laid down for you as state-sponsored ones would have.”\nSophia pressed her collarbone, frowning. “Really? ‘Cause we’ve already invested so much.”\nMatthew ran his fingers through his hair and began pressing strands of hair. “I get that you guys prefer to just go with what works, but with these goblins, I really suggest that you guys try at least once to talk with them.\n“Matt, Matt, Matt,” Sophia said simultaneously, leaning forward slightly.\nTilting his head widely, Matthew continued unhindered: “I know the prevailing notion that there’s nothing that can be done, but that’s what they’re thinking as well! Don’t you think that’s what they’re thinking as well?”\nSophia leaned forward further. “Listen to me! You’re not listening. You’re not listening.”\nMatthew ran his fingers through his hair at the back. “Yeah?”\nSophia paused for a moment and calmed herself, returning to composure. “I tried. It’s impossible.”\n“Ha, well, you didn’t try hard enough,” he said jokingly, offering a way to eliminate the tension between them.\n“Well, they were hard to kill, and I didn’t know what to do,” she said, trying to join him.\n“But I will tell them about this.” Matthew brought back the tension.\nSophia was staring in silence, having broken eye contact with Matthew.\nMatthew passed by her, and this topic ended. After grabbing a drink for her, he sat down, gesturing her to sit down as well.\nWhen Sophia sat down, they both drank, glancing at each other and at the forest outside through the window of the room. They were in Matthew’s cottage, which he bought with the money he earned from his employee relations job.\nAfterwards, Matthew said with a polite smile, “I came from another world.”\nSophia then helped him by pointing books to him about teleportation magic. This calmed Matthew and made their communication smoother in the long run.\nReturning to the present, Matthew noted several golems in the distance, but he had seen many golems already. They reminded him of the golem he met when he registered to visit a village. Even if it’s only been around a month ago, he felt like it was so far away, and he never had time to process it. When he did have days of rest, he used it to learn how to cope with the fact that he was no longer at Earth, so he never focused on what happened recently. He knew more about the deep past than what happened a month ago, and that was because life was happening so fast for him to keep up. Even now, he still felt nostalgic and grief. The loss of his family, friends, and life back on Earth was very painful.\nHowever, he now wanted to think about what happened a month ago.\nFor one, he remembered the golem and how he saw it while walking around the town on one of his rest days. Since it was too busy, he couldn’t speak to it, leaving this as a hole in his heart that he couldn’t answer.\nSecond, he remembered the older man he met while doing his kindness quest. On one of his rest days, he talked to him again, and one of the things he said was, “Do you think we’ll forge mighty alliances again…” The older man was reflecting on the past, and his nostalgic expression was probably the same one Matthew had right now.\nThe older man said: “I still remember when I was around 25… sailing through the sides of an island. And I made a small place under a hill where I had a wooden door, a furnace, a chest, a bed, and some fishing equipment. I remember the sound of the rain as I hid inside. It was a magical place, and I learned how to be at peace at myself at that time. But that brief moment, though lasting for several hours or days, felt like forever.”\nAfter several failed attempts at getting the older man to talk about the present, he realized that the older man was stuck in the past, making productive conversation very difficult with him.\nReturning his focus to the present, Matthew watched several boulders flying above him, as an army of undead reached out from under the earth.\n“What the hell?” said Matthew, still confident. “This seems too upfront, no?”\nHe noticed that several small dragon-like undead creatures were flying down in a volley formation.\n“What the hell is that!” screamed an adventurer.\nThe creatures fell, and as soon as they died, they exploded.\nMatthew ran, his legs dragging along behind him.\nMany lines of adventurers fell apart, but with several magic spells, the fleeing adventurers were forced to returned to formation.\nAs soon as the undead army hit the adventurers, Matthew saw a familiar adventurer aiming his ice arrow, Marcher, before he was overrun with goblins. “No!” Matthew’s face screamed.\nFurther lines of adventurers crashed and burned, and Matthew began to realize a trend with the King and Mawkery’s decision-making. The King sent soldiers to advance without precaution, and Mawkery sent exploding creatures.\nHe was stuck in a battle that he didn’t control, and even experienced adventurers were being thrown like fodder to the jaws of the pig.\nChapter 8 - A Clash of Strategies: Reevaluating Roles and Alliances linkMatthew never knew that the King and Mawkery would do this, and all the research and information never suggested this.\nHe wondered if this situation exposed the limits of his skill set. Indeed, time, space, and resources were essential, but he questioned the quest selection of the [System] in pointing him to Mawkery.\nWhen the Mawkery quest first came in, he was expecting something easy at first, but as information flowed and tensions ramped up, he began pouring his efforts into teamwork and community, hoping to beat Mawkery by organization and structure. If he could orchestrate a strategic offense, then his chances of success were high.\nHowever, the King had his own way of doing things, and it was very headstrong like a love-strung teenager unwilling to bear humiliation. Moreover, Mawkery threw the most obvious and worse attacks, yet the King didn’t realize it at all. If the commanders recognized it, then the King was too stubborn to care.\nIn issues of great importance, it didn’t make sense that humans in such a high level of power would choose to prioritize expressing their own feelings over the most optimal approach. Yet, it did.\nMoreover, it didn’t make sense that all the available information about Mawkery never pointed out his tendency to use exploding creatures. He wondered if the people who saw Mawkery could use their eyes at all. He hated being given false or incomplete information.\nWith so many issues that weren’t his fault, he could only focus on his current skills and resources. Now that he knew how unreliable people and allegedly “first-hand” accounts were, he could make better decisions in the future.\nAt the end of the war, Matthew stared at his broken body that he kept alive with healing. Meanwhile, several adventurers he knew began being pullled along, then placed atop a pile, and soon dragged to a pit. His expression was that of shock, and other survivors shared his downbeat posture and gait.\nAfter they were allowed to leave, Matthew returned home.\nYou have failed to hit the hobgoblin menace! That’s unfortunate. You lose 10,000 XP!\nName: Matthew Cruz\nLevel: 72 -\u003e 41\nCurrent experience: 148\nSpecies: Human\nAge: 25\nSkills: None\nSpells: None / None\nVitality: 15\nQuests: None\nTitles: [Goblin Slayer]\nHe rubbed his forehead. “I don’t get it anymore. Why is the [System] forcing me to engage in these quests anyway? What’s the logic? I don’t get it. I don’t get it anymore. Is everything arbitrary at this point? Is the King just emotionally unstable? Is Mawkery just actually bad at war? Why is it that all his enemies make bad decisions that they lost to him? Were they so much worse? Where’s the logic here? Why is it that I am the only one who cares about this? Are people just complacent? They don’t want to think about making things better and just accept things the way they are? I mean, I come from Earth, I guess. It makes sense. I’m the only one who knows that things could be so much better. If they just read a book, then they would know how to make better decisions. But everyone is so ‘ugh’ here. It feels like I’m looking at a bunch of squealing acorns or something. Humans are better than this, goddammit! We created spaceships and rockets and shit! I don’t get why these people, being people with humanities inside them, are so irrational and ‘ugh’! It’s like staring at a bunch of dweebs who eat dog shit all day. I don’t understand anything anymore, man! Why do people do do?”\nWhen he returned to his adventurer party, he decided to take a break, but before he left, they gave him the purple and yellow outfit. Even if they were sentimental and talked long with him, he wasn’t really listening. Despite spending more time with this party than with his first one, he didn’t want to be stuck doing pity sessions.\nHe wore the gift outfit, deciding on living a slower life for now.\nSeveral days later, he learned many things. He learned that the King disbanded the adventurer coalition and laid off its leaders. He wondered if the King and the adventurer guild were overextending treasury funds by employing them in the first place. He also learned that Marcher was confirmed dead along with two others he knew at one point.\nHe decided to go to a schedule meeting he was invited to. The attendees included individuals such as Brackern, Brandon, Deathbringer, Sophia, Michel, Prism, Ella, Ada, Kairo, and Echo.\nThis meeting served to highlight new findings, approaches, concerns, and other relevant topics contributed independently by each participant, keeping everyone on the same page.\nAlso, it was Matthew’s ideal playground—communication.\nTheir voices cheery like friends hiding in the dark, their eyes overlooking like flying torch-lit outposts, their mouths quick like beasts rushing under the boards, their camaraderie all-embracing like the movements of time, the attendees engaged in small-talk.\nAs soon as he got wind of everything happening in the adventurer sphere, he found himself roped into another quest that orchestrated the collaboration of 5 adventurer parties. However, this was distinct from a traditional adventurer coalition since this quest was more physically loose and separated. In particular, each adventurer party carried distinct responsibilities along a supply chain–like logistics network. So rather than fighting monsters at their turf, they had to find indirect means of targeting their foes. This included means such as traps, traditional warfare techniques such as trenches and fortifications, and other forms of attacks such as artillery. However, the quest still involved close combat and mobile and flexible intelligence gathering and interaction, though to a lesser degree than the former coalition in which Matthew had participated.\nFor one, his group received several different assignments, including defending a certain border as a facilitator of healing magic. Since healing magic could be activated across multiple healers for more effectiveness, ensuring that the bond that held the healers together remained uninterrupted was paramount. Moreover, Matthew was able to get himself assigned as a healer. In conclusion, since his team would be relevant to his role, he was much more attuned to how he could contribute effectively to cohesion as a healer, making it less stressful for him during training.\nHowever, as training went on and he showed a lack of success as a healer, the coalition leaders called him for a discussion about his skills, spells, titles, and equipment. Since he had little to none of these, they resorted to asking him what kind of role he thought he was best at. When Matthew learned of the ‘warder’ role, he pushed for it. As a result, they reassigned him to the role of a ‘warder,’ which meant that he would place wards at objectives and replace them if needed.\nMoreover, during one of the training sessions involving the various adventurer parties, he found himself admiring the various styles in which people fought. Yet, they each played according to their strengths and avoided situations where their weaknesses bared their teeth, transitioning between each other in rapid succession.\nFirst, the training sessions focused on reaping the established benefits of each party and their members with each other in a space observed by other parties. However, soon, the training sessions began separating individual adventurers into different teams until each individual was comfortable. Due to this gradualness, new teams were pitted against adventurer parties in disjointed matches. Though, with the guidance of the coalition leaders, they they harnessed this disjointedness, learning how to win from behind and extend a winning lead in different situations.\nWith the amount of foresight the coalition leaders showed, he had faith that this quest was going to be much better handled than how the King did with the Mawkery one. But it could be argued that the King’s failure was not that surprising since managing 5 adventurer parties was much easier than a whole army.\nAs soon as the training sessions came to a stop, the coalition leaders gathered everyone as they usually did in the morning for a roll call and prepared to mobilize.\nWhen they finally mobilized at the location and finished any hiccups along the way, they first scouted the primary roads and paths for hobgoblins. After finding very many hobgoblins amassing in some roads, they sent out their warders and ward sweepers to the objectives most remote from these roads.\nAfter the warders and ward sweepers returned, the main force began to move into these objectives and plant traps, dig trenches and fortifications, and prepare their artillery. They were going to establish control of these free objectives first and its neighboring roads and paths before visiting the objectives that the goblins likely controlled.\nNaturally, the hobgoblins already knew that the coalition was there, but they were willing to let go of the objectives after they saw how powerful they were. If they overextended themselves, they would lose many more objectives.\nNow that the coalition had set up, they knew that the main part of the quest was happening now. If they could maintain control of their objectives, then they could soon mobilize reinforcements to take over the hobgoblin objectives. Similarly, the hobgoblins were already calling for reinforcements.\nIn short, a battle between them would soon start.\nTo clarify, the objectives included bridges, dungeons, villages, outposts, roads, hill junctures, and paths that served as bonds between many different places, providing a much faster, safer way to move people and things around. For example, sometimes, only one path allowed passage between two places, because the other paths ran through another foreign-controlled objective that didn’t allow easy or cheap passage or any at all.\nIn conclusion, Matthew stared at everything, and he gave a wry smile.\nLater, as soon as it was his turn to replace a ward that one of the hobgoblins destroyed, he found himself grappling with a spear and aiming it at a hobgoblin alongside other warders. Earlier, the hobgoblin tripped and fell on a trap, giving his warding team the opportunity to take his spear and plunge it straight into the hobgoblin. As the hobgoblin wrestled for control, the warders had already stabbed the hobgoblin in a vital area, bringing it down.\nAfterwards, Matthew repeatedly exhaled with joy, skipping and throwing his arm up in the air. “Yeah!” he mouthed as he joined the other warders back. “Yeah! Let’s go!”\nThe warders echoed his energy, bringing the good news to the ward sweepers.\nEven if it was a small victory, their ability to take down a hobgoblin reflected their first step in helping out traditionally even if their role entailed a more supportive or utility role.\nAs Matthew and the adventurers continued, magical artillery strikes from the hobgoblins rained down, stripping many areas bare and making them vulnerable to air control.\nHowever, the adventurers were swift in bringing out their air force in the form of flying summoned creatures. Moreover, the hobgoblins matched their pace, as their artillery strikes and air deployment were coordinated.\nAt this point, it was an all-out battle between air units that relied on counterpicking between individuals and skill matchups.\nMeanwhile, on the ground, Matthew and his warding team’s contributions in vision control made it for an assassin team.\nIn particular, these assassins sneaked into enemy territory, hid in wait, watched a team of tanks pass by them, and killed the unsuspecting team of archers that passed next a distance behind the tanks. This distance was created because the tanks didn’t want the archers tailgating them while they face-checked bushes. However, the assassins exploited this opening. Naturally, while waiting, they did check for invisible enemy wards in the bushes and found none, removing all hesitation. Moreover, they exploited a situational overlap between a hobgoblin team of warders, a team of ward sweepers, and the team of archers. So they finished off the whole company, including the now isolated tanks. It was a smaller company, but it was still very rewarding. All in all, they created a hole on this side of the battle, allowing entry into the objectives.\nThis allowed the rest of the teams, including juggernaut-type teams, vanguards, skirmishers, and divers, to take on the hobgoblins’ response to the loss of the company.\nAt the end of the battle, Matthew smirked, his expression zooming through many feelings.\nIn the aftermath, the adventurers gained control of the objectives in the area, forcing the hobgoblins to retreat. Because of the expenses involved, maintaining control over the area was not feasible due to insufficient resources. So they pushed for a win-win alliance between them and the hobgoblins before bitterness started to settled in.\nThis new alliance allowed Matthew to walk alongside hobgoblins in a peaceful setting for the first time.\nIn the repurposed hobgoblin camp, Matthew had a reunion with Deathbringer, Sophia, and other familiar adventurers. He introduced his fellow warders and agreed to eat together. In the background, hobgoblins and adventurers were slowly beginning to acknowledge each other and even discuss about their respective food cultures. However, it was still an awkward start, but those who initiated conversations made use of this opportunity to relax and reignite hopes of returning home. As for the adventurers among them, they excitedly imagined the profits.\nChapter 9 - Paths Converge: Bonds, Quests, and Shared Endeavors linkMatthew stared at Deathbringer. “How are we managing?” he said.\nDeathbringer nodded with a weary smile, pressing his hands together. “Fine, we can arrange for a dinner later,” he said, “but you’re still participating.”\nMatthew hummed, noticing Sophia coming close as she finished speaking with a group of adventurers who then left. “Oh, Sophia, adventuring has been going along nicely, but I wager that you’re even better.”\nSophia stared blankly at the food at the table where everyone was seated before she glanced perfunctorily at Matthew and the rest, her eyes finally resting at Matthew. “What?” she said in a small, meek voice.\nExcluding Sophia, Matthew glanced at Deathbringer and the rest inquisitively. “Oh, I was talking about adventuring… since y’know, the Blades adventurer group that you guys had is now defunct right.”\n“Oh, yeah…” Sophia smiled with furrowed brows. Even if the first adventurer group that Matthew joined—“the Blades”—was a touchy subject, she didn’t feel too bothered that it was Matthew. She felt guilty about Matthew being left out in the aftermath, so she was willing to listen and answer questions if it was him.\n“The adventurers… yeah, they separated. It’s been a while since then, but yeah, we’re still considering whether we should have share the loot, since according to Deathbringer, Michel still had the party’s treasury funds.”\n“I didn’t know that. I visited her, but she had a problem?”\n“She did? I didn’t know. Could it be because of her necromancy?”\n“Maybe…? I didn’t know. I didn’t know that she had… necromancy.”\nTheir voices were quick, while the rest of the conversations at the table were slow and mostly characterized by short answers. Currently, one of the adventurers was being interviewed for a new role, since he was still a newbie to a certain strategic process. Deathbringer was unrelated to that. It was Ella, Nova, and Echo from his second adventurer party, and the person being interviewed was a damsel named “Treasise.” As for the other adventurers present, they were Ada, Kairo, and four others whom Matthew didn’t know.\nMatthew glanced at the others in the group before staring at Sophia and Deathbringer. Because time was of the essence, he jumped to the important questions.\n“Why did you guys save me?”\n“We saved you because you have a reason to live, didn’t you?” said Deathbringer.\n“Yeah,” echoed Sophia, her face scrunched up as she supported it with her hand in a very casual manner.\nMoreover, Brandon, a familiar member from Matthew’s first adventurer party nodded, his face ethnically light green with a touch of purple from eating a particular magical fruit. His nod was shared by Brackern, another familiar member, who was in the middle of a conversation with his friends.\n“Yeah, I did. I wanted to explore this world.” He gave a default answer he had prepared, but he really did want to see what this world had to say for itself.\n“Really?” Deathbringer turned around, tapping one of the adventurers sitting down, before he grabbed a cup and placed it back down perfunctorily, his eyes darting and torso twisting with thought. “Really?” he said with a longer intonation. “That’s funny because I do remember you saying that you didn’t want things or something like that.”\n“Did I? I don’t remember.”\n“Oh, I must be mistaken then. Anyway, guys, get this guy some food. He looks deprived of life and good meat.”\n“Good meat,” Sophia said while chuckling softly, her eyes and tone low and subdued due to contemplation.\n“Okay, here you go, Mr. Matthew,” said Ella, giving a smile that could have been its brightest. “I want you to hold onto this as well.” Showing and handing Matthew several orbs, she strolled to a seat across from him, straddling a chair. “What is it—”\n“How about…” said Deathbringer simultaneously. “Oh, you first.”\n“What is it that brought you here really, Matthew, besides exploring the world,” Ella said, emphasizing “exploring the world” with a wide tone and gesture.\n“It’s the goblins I guess.”\n“Oh, there are no goblins where you live.”\n“That too. We didn’t have any monsters at all.”\n“Oh…! That’s why you were so confused about the dungeon steps and the System.”\n“Yeah…” His voice dropped to a murmur. “I guess.”\n“Basically, huh?”\n“Yeah, yeah.”\n“So what made you want to quit?” said Ella, catching the rest of her party’s attention.\nMatthew, being a former member of her party, cringed. “Oh, right… I didn’t really want to quit. It’s more of a break. I remember telling you guys this, or maybe I forgot.”\n“I suggest you tell us exactly why. They’re not too happy about your summatory disappearance. It’s like you were taken away by one of our rival groups. Though, that’s besides the point. Tell us why you’re here and what you plan on doing now that we know that you were a part of my former teammate’s group party.”\n“Huh…? Who… was your former—”\n“Sophia.”\n“Michel?” Matthew said simultaneously.\n“Oh, that Michel. She’s not really the kind of person you expected, no? The last I contacted her, she said that she was trying to summon demon stuff. Don’t know why. Don’t know when. Don’t know how. But she’s crazy.” Her tone suggested that she was joking, but Matthew wasn’t entirely sure.\nThen, her tone shifted to an obviously light-hearted one. “Blades was a good name, no?”\n“Yeah, I only learned it today. I thought ‘blades’ was an alternative term for adventurer party actually.”\n“Really? You’re right, we don’t turn people into blades just to form a party.” She laughed.\nMatthew grinned politely. Though, for some reason, he felt like something was off. But something was always off in this world. If he started doubting everything and became a cynic, it would be difficult for him to find opportunities. There were opportunities to be gained in optimistic and more cynical thinking. A balance of both would be success.\nIn particular, he judged Michel to be very troublesome and hard to work with. He rated her level of agreeableness to be low. If he had to start working with her, it would be tiresome and a waste of energy. He would get burned out if she started dragging him along with her problems. Anyone that holed themselves up usually had very specific priorities that didn’t lend much to collaboration, so they would hook themselves up with the first person they met and make that person their little submissive little toy. Though, that scenario was entirely speculatory and clearly biased. If he wanted to judge her better, he had to keep listening.\nIn the end, he wrapped the discussion up and moved on.\nSome time after returning home, he found himself admiring a loud adventurer at the guild.\nThe adventurer said: “I am the Tamer! And I am very good at taming goblins! If you want a goblin tamer, that’s me!”\nWhat Matthew found amusing about her was the fact that she felt the need to announce herself.\nAs soon as group of independent adventurers rallied under the Tamer, an uncommon group with a tamer as their leader formed. And Matthew was in it.\nHe wanted to see what they were going to do. More importantly, since his warding role in the coalition went well, he thought that he could continue this trend in a small party with fresh faces and new opportunities to train himself.\nDuring their journey, Tamer showed off her skills and began commanding her goblins to grab coffee berries from a little high up in the trees. If it was a human climbing, the branch would have bent over after half a minute or so. But the goblins’ lighter weight made it a piece of cake. To reward them, the tamer made them eat the berries.\nUsually, Matthew only looked around him and listened during the journeys before quests, but he said: “How does that work? I have never seen that at all.”\n“Yeah, it’s what we were taught not to do: use goblins as pets. In fact, if I showed this to my tamer professors, they would kill me probably.”\n“Probably?”\n“Oh, they would get so mad!” She grabbed a branch for support, but it broke under her weight. “I remember this one time I was just trying to get a drink for one of my bird pets, but they didn’t want me to feed them potion juice. You know, the juice before the potion actually becomes the potion. I just wanted to test their will to survive and see if they were as capable as people. You know. I’ve seen people, especially adventurers, do amazing things, so I thought, ‘If animals can hopefully reach that level of human thinking and willpower, then that would be so cool!’”\nMatthew said with surprise, “Okay?”\nMoving on, Tamer raised her arms and almost slipped, catching herself with her quick legs. In the process, she splashed mud on her calves and made Matthew halt.\nCoincidentally, Matthew smiled weakly when he saw Tamer’s goblins, who, despite their commonly known robustness, had scars all over their body.\nHis face softening a little more than usual, he smiled at the Tamer, attentive to the subtle reactions of the others present. “What kind of training do you undergo as a tamer?”\nThe Tamer grinned before she demonstrated her skills and spells as a tamer at the quest destination.\nShe raised her arms and cast the skill [Break Barrel], making her goblins haul barrels of holy water at a group of skeletons. Her skill allowed her to make the barrels break by themselves on her command. This way, she could time her holy water attacks to maximum effect.\nAs soon as she finished off a squad of armed skeletons ranging from archers to spearmen, she requested a standing ovation from Matthew and the others. “Now, how did I do?”\nTo Matthew’s surprise, she grinned cheerily rather than cheekily.\nHowever, while listening, Matthew multitasked to prevent the party from overstaying, walking away to guide Tamer’s isolated goblins closer to the party. Moreover, by pushing for another adventurer’s suggestion, he contributed to the party’s shift of focus to the exit. As soon as they left the cave, a large number of skeletons emerged from the darkness and ran forward, aiming to kill off one of the goblins. They did this to salvage their failed attempt at turning around the fight earlier, which occurred due to Matthew’s shrewdness.\nLastly, the skeletons failed, immediately retreating.\nOverall, Matthew’s analysis of the dangers this vision-limiting choke point of a cave posed was correct, and his wariness of caves, a product of his Earth knowledge, was one strong reason for this victory.\nWhen the quest ended, Matthew noticed that this was a good time to assess his own abilities, considering that even without his wards, he could easily understand a combat situation.\nShifting to Tamer, her response to Matthew’s tactical skill was that of ignorance. She didn’t know what Matthew did, but she was confident that Matthew was reliable. She just trusted her instincts here.\nThis compatibility between her and him encouraged Matthew to take another quest with the party.\nOn their next quest, the party was tasked with protecting a small chest, as the chest was going to be looted by goblins a few minutes from now.\nWhen they arrived at the location, a small farm-like enclosure that covered a cave entrance, they prepared by placing down their things, bringing out their spears, and making a simple formation. Since they had the advantage and they only had limited time, this would do.\nEventually, the goblins rushed out of the cave, grabbing several weapons on the ground. Even if they were quick, Matthew and his fellow adventurers kept them in place with spears and well-coordinated movements. In the meantime, Matthew viewed several instances of skills and spells being used and paid more informed attention compared to before.\nOne of the adventurers broke the momentum of the spear formation because she had a spell worth casting. Seeing that the goblins were darting around at the end of their spears, she clapped her hands together, creating a shockwave that travelled in a cone in front of her. Goblins hit by the shockwave took magic damage and were briefly silenced, losing their ability to cast spells that required an incantation for the duration. This was her spell [Thunderous Clap].\nAs soon as the goblins received the hit, they reached out to counterattack, but the spears were in the way. In the end, they retreated, ending the fight with a successful defence.\nAfterwards, Matthew began wondering whether his affinity with spells could evolve to the point that it resembled the adventurer who cast [Thunderous Clap].\nTo achieve this goal, he had a discussion with this adventurer, who introduced herself as “Zoey”.\nShe was arranging flowers and amulets together because she was going to sell it in the afternoon. Not only that, but she was also a musician, who played the lyre. Furthermore, she had been working as an adventurer for 17 years; however, she restricted herself to the beginner levels, reaping the benefits of a slower life while retaining the fast pace of goblin game. Indeed, the [System] recognized her efforts with the title [Master of the Basics]. Overall, she considered herself a well-rounded individual.\nMatthew and Tamer learned all this from the discussion.\nAs Matthew and Tamer asked Zoey for details, they soon found themselves talking to each other until Matthew finally got info on Tamer’s skills.\nTamer had three skills: [Break Barrel], [Marching Tire], and [Remove Clothes]. To explain the two latter ones, [Marching Tire] made it so that her enemies received a 2 second 20% slowing effect, and [Remove Clothes] made it easier for her to remove a specified piece of clothing or set of clothes from her body instantly on command. This only applied to 100% fabrics. So metal armor were excluded, but gambisons were allowed.\nIn particular, her strategy for [Remove Clothes] involved wearing gambison with extra padding enough to restrain her movements partially. But when her enemies came close at the sight of an easy enemy, she used this skill to remove the detachable padding and catch them off guard. Moreover, if needed, she could wait until after the first round of attacks on her torso before she removed the padding to maximize damage mitigation. This was also a good time to use [Marching Tire] to pin them down.\nAfter seeing her demonstration of her set of skills, he invited her to a cafe. Once they were there, Matthew asked Tamer: “How did you get your skills and spells? From what I know, I’m supposed to wait until the [System] rewards me one day, and getting the [System] to do that is a personal experience.”\nLooking warily behind her, Tamer said: “No, the best way to get skills is by sinking all your levels into your body through your wrist or by dedicating it to a god.”\nAfter she saw that he was listening curiously, she continued, “People say it’s personal because it’s usually a matter of beliefs.” Moreover, she took his comfortable demeanor as a sign that they were safe.\nMatthew rubbed his chin, looking up. “I haven’t seen anyone go to church—”\n“But that’s because you only see that side of them. The one that goes outside and hunts monsters. If you saw how they really were, some of them can get very pious. It’s a matter of personal beliefs, not something that necessarily conflicts with adventuring, so it’s easy to hide one’s alliance with the Architecture God.”\n“Ah, okay.” Matthew glanced at her face more intently than before.\nHis expression grew suspicious. “Wait a minute. How did you get your spells then? They don’t seem too ‘architectury.’”\n“I’m not aligned with Him. I believe in someone else, but yes, your spells can be totally random. But that depends on you. I don’t care though.” She raised her voice before lowering her voice to normal as if that side of her was a mere theatrical persona. “I am the Tamer! But yeah, what do you believe, I wonder?”\nSome time after their conversation, rain poured, which reminded Matthew of the older man’ explorative story. But this rain was different because it kept pouring and pouring non-stop until floods emerged, settling in the lowest areas.\nWishing he had an umbrella, he went to the nearby shops and asked if they had something that could help with the rain.\nOne of the shopkeepers he encountered gave him a handcrafted umbrella. He then asked the man how he made it. After a short conversation between the shopkeeper and another man inside and a few questions for Matthew, he was promptly let in where he was offered a seat on the floor. The shopkeeper was on the floor as well, and he was putting together various ingredients for his next umbrella.\nAs soon as the umbrella-maker finished, Matthew wondered if building, crafting, and inventing were much more easier in this world.\nHe noticed several items placed all around the inside of the shop, bearing symbols of their culture.\nHe then realized that the shopkeeper was likely from a different culture than the adventurers he knew.\nSince he wanted to see what it meant, he went home, took out a lot of money, and returned to the shop where he handsomely gifted the shopkeeper the money he brought.\nEven if he couldn’t craft, he thought that this man deserved the money.\nHowever, he looked annoyed, immediately demonstrating how to make the umbrella again.\nAfter a while, Matthew realized something. The man was trying to get him to learn how to make an umbrella. But being mute, he could communicate with his face and body.\nHe didn’t realize earlier, but now, he listened and followed his directions, mimicking him until he found himself with an umbrella of his own making.\nThe shopkeeper smiled and celebrated before he lay down, coughing.\nWhen Matthew glanced at him with concern, the man smiled and gave a thumbs-up.\nMatthew stared for a while and then politely left, offering the money to the other person in the room. But they also refused, telling him to leave now.\nOnce he was outside at the door, he looked at his hands briefly before advancing with the intent of contacting his former adventurer parties.\nDespite the persistent discomfort of the flood and the strong wind and rain, he continued walking.\nMeanwhile, several adventurers rode flying creatures in the sky, and others blocked the flood water with spherical magic shields.\nMost people stayed inside, since doors and other openings were often enchanted with water-blocking magic. This gave more freedom for hilly streets.\nOnce Matthew reached his cottage, he took a deep breath, stretched, and washed himself with stored water and with the help of a smaller container that he called a “tabo.” It was very relaxing.\nNaturally, with enough physical comfort and time spent alone and in quiet, Matthew’s focus shifted to his existence.\nIn his imaginations, he saw goblins screaming in hell and people crawling for salvation. He saw himself at the tip of a long road in front of a giant fiery devil shaped like a human but with the relevant horns.\nHe imagined himself creating swathes of buildings across the land and placing his name upon each of them, as if thunderous music sung for his name.\nHe imagined himself tearing apart peoples’ clothes, which were symbolic of their pride and self-esteem. He wanted to control them and turn them into comprehensible things.\nHe imagined himself screaming and begging for mercy.\nBut his expression was still, and his gaze was longing. His body was postured for contemplation and introspection. But with time, his muscles tensed at irregular intervals around his body with growing speed.\nSoon, he stood up, sensing the fragility of his own body and the strength of his own will. He thought that this fragility was the reason for his powerful sense of drive.\nLater, while Michel, the second-in-command of Matthew’s first now-defunct adventurer party, was cleaning, she saw a figure outside her window.\nMichel smiled in response and opened the door where Matthew stood with his hands placed sheepishly in front of himself but taking on an otherwise sturdy posture and expression.\n“How are you doing lately?” Michel said. “I haven’t seen you this buffed up. What did you do?” She used a friendly tone, noting the inviting smell of rose petals wafting around her home.\nMatthew glanced around right before spending 3 seconds to look her straight in the eyes. Soon, he refocused on her before doing it all over again. “A lot.”\nIncidentally, even if she had a feeling that Matthew was being disingenious with the humility he displayed with his hand placement, she didn’t bother asking about it. Overall, Matthew’s politeness was a positive trait in her book.\nMichel put away her broom and dustpan. “Really? Tell me.”\nWith the way Matthew looked at his feet as he strolled inside on her invitation, he looked politely measured. Moreover, he paused between each step, so Michel was sure that he was being disingenious.\nWhen Matthew finally came inside after only a few seconds, he smiled, and Michel was quick to reciprocate.\nMatthew began recounting his experiences, starting with his kindness quest.\nMichel gestured him to a chair where Matthew, after taking a few seconds to resolve his misunderstanding, sat down with his hands on his lap, pressing his lips together shyly.\nBased on her perspective, Matthew was not this reserved the last time he visited her, but maybe it was because he was in a different head space at the time.\nAfter Matthew finished recounting some of his past experiences, Michel asked him, “Do you know anyone that can solve this?”\nShe revealed her right arm, and it was red and pulsing with straight hair-like filaments twitching all around it.\nMatthew shouted with surprise.\nWhen Matthew finally calmed down, he asked her what happened.\nMichel said that she was a necromancer and that she had no one else to talk about with regard to this. Her isolation made it challenging for her. So she wanted to expose herself to someone she believed had little personal ties to her and her former friends while also being someone she could trust.\nWhen Matthew told her to contact a professional, she said that she wanted to see if he found anything that could help her.\nMatthew said that he could heal her, but she made herself clear that she didn’t want to be healed.\nAs soon as Matthew was on board with the idea of helping her manage her right arm, she revealed that she had already contacted a necromaner group. But she wanted one or a few people to know about this before she went to them. This way, if anything happened, at least one person knew.\nMatthew said that he could help her, so he asked the most relevant question, “Do you have a [System] quest for this?”\n“I do. I’ll show you right now.”\nQuest: Necrotic Restoration\nObjective: Seek out and retrieve the ancient tome of necrotic remedies hidden within the forbidden catacombs beneath the Old Oak Grove. Within the tome lies the knowledge necessary to stabilize and control the necrotic energy coursing through your right arm.\nReward:\nMastery of Necrotic Arts: Unlock advanced necromantic techniques and spells, allowing you to harness the power of the undead with greater precision and control.\nNecrotic Affinity Enhancement: Strengthen your connection to the realm of death, granting you heightened senses and awareness of necrotic energies in your surroundings.\nNecromancer’s Sigil: Receive a mystical sigil imbued with protective enchantments, safeguarding you from harmful necrotic influences and bolstering your magical prowess.\nInvitation to the Necromancer’s Council: Gain recognition and respect among fellow necromancers as a skilled practitioner. Earn the opportunity to join the prestigious Necromancer’s Council, where you can share knowledge, seek guidance, and forge alliances with others of your kind.\nIn light of this, Matthew became much more animated, finding something he could benefit from. This meant that it was in his best interests to help her out, making it a win-win situation for the both of them. “This is so good!” If he could find a kindred spirit who actually aligned with his goals and interests in her, then he could stave off the loss of his Earth family, life, and friends and the stress from the torturous hardship he experienced in this world.\n## Chapter 10 - Reflections and Realizations: Facing Moral Dilemmas and Setting New Directions linkMatthew stared at Michel, surprised by her disgusted expression. “What?” he said, the excitement in his voice dying down.\n“Just… nevermind.”\n“What is it?”\nShe looked up and sighed slowly, mouth closed. Before she spoke, she grimaced. “I’ve been finding it very difficult to keep up with the expectations placed upon me. Despite being a necromancer, I have been allowed to operate under strict adherance to a code. I am currently bound to that code, and basically, this code allows the adventurer brass to use me in helping with traps. I have a passive ability that makes my traps particularly effective, so it’s not the most comfortable for me. I have been spending too much of my time idling about trying to concoct a solution. But to no avail. Nonetheless, I have a thirst for goblin blood. So even if it—”\n“Wait, what? What the hell does that even mean?”\n“What? I understand that goblin blood itself is not something everyone desires, but I do as a necromancer.”\n“Why are you talking like this? Stop this now.”\n“It is only necessary when it is, and the fact that I care about it so much reflects my humanity.”\n“Can you stop talking…”\n“If I see another disgusting little goblin, I will kill it and make his eyes turn to blue. All that beauty will fall away, and time will eat up its soul.”\n“What… the fuck!”\n“That’s the truth.”\n“No, no, no!”\n“You kill goblins. How are you different from me? The end result is the same.” She didn’t sound so sure at that last part.\nMatthew pressed his forehead. “Look. Michel, I understand that you’re finally opening up to me, and I’m happy you did. But please… don’t do this. Don’t, don’t… let this be who you are. I understand it can be difficult. But we can manage this if you just give me the opportunity. Give yourself the opportunity. You can do it.”\nMichel listened to him the entire time without interrupting him. She was confident that it was already too late for her to pretend that she didn’t savor murdering goblins. It was a characteristic of her class, and she couldn’t get rid of it. It was like a man realizing he liked men. The good thing was that in this society, killing goblins was not frowned upon. Even enjoying the hunt of goblins was celebrated in culture through symbolism and other forms of communication such as in entertainment.\nMatthew shook his head. “I only did it because it was necessary.” He didn’t realize it, but he was echoing Sophia’s defence for taking the lives of goblins.\nHe continued, “Okay, let’s set the record straight or something. Goblins are bandits, right? So whatever we do, they are a threat to human life and possibly those goblins who live slowly. Not all goblins are bandits I wager.”\n“Yes.”\n“But more than bandits, do they belong in tribes? Do they have their own claimed state and land?”\n“Yes. They belong to tribes, and they have a confederation of tribes that serves as a state with its own claimed land and border.”\n“Okay, so why are we fighting the goblins? Even more productive: why are the goblins fighting us?”\n“The goblins we fight are those who have been spawned in this world.”\n“So those who aren’t are not?”\n“What?”\n“Those who don’t fight didn’t spawn in this world?”\n“No. Those who don’t fight are those who decided to build their own society instead of killing the first humans they see.”\n“So do these goblins have anything at all to say for themselves? Do we have goblins here in the city?”\n“Yeah, we do. But they serve as slaves—”\n“Well, that makes things difficult. If I was a goblin, you know what I’d do? I’d try to get humans to engage with us in dialogue and try to find a way to beat up those goblins who spawn and want to kill humans. But if the goblins are getting enslaved… the peaceful ones… Then, this situation is very complex.”\n“Yeah. I also love goblin blood.”\n“Michel…” The word “no” was written all over Matthew’s face.\nAfter a long pause, Matthew got up and started stretching. “Why do I have to debate about this? Why do I have to debate whether a goblin life is worth preserving? And why the hell do you guys even hunt anything?”\n“Monsters. They’re a constant threat.”\n“Makes sense. But what doesn’t is you guys deciding to kill goblins even after you guys know that they can be befriended.”\n“Not all goblins.”\n“But still. Don’t you guys want to see them grow and develop as villagers? Don’t you want to see them develop their own culture and technology? Don’t you want to share resources and find ways to expand in ways that promote a sense of community and… ‘manyness’?”\n“Maybe. There’s been talks of goblins in tournaments.”\nMatthew rubbed his forehead again, looking down. “I’m just a regular guy. But you guys are seriously… Okay, then, let’s just say that is normal for you guys. I still don’t think it’s right. I don’t want to be the foreign invader who tries to set things straight according to his beliefs. But damn. Do you guys seriously…”\nMichel said, “If I can prove to you I can fight well, then you have to trust me.”\n“What? How does that correlate?”\n“Just trust me.”\n“Damn…”\nAs he stared at Michel’s confident expression for a good ten seconds, a smile gradually emerged on Matthew’s face, albeit with hints of worry and tension. “Okay… Damn, sure!”\nAs soon as they reached a certain border in the direction of Michel’s [System] quest destination, Michel explained that she would be meeting with some of her fellow party members here. Anyway, their destination, Old Oak Grove, waited at the horizon.\nAs soon as they reached Old Oak Grove, Matthew realized that any sign of goblin villages would be obstructed by the thick canopy of the tropical rainforest.\nMatthew was already getting exhausted, so he rested for a while, feeling a little light-headed. Naturally, traveling and going on quests the whole day was the case. The accumulated stress from engaging in a war that almost left him dead still bothered him. So he was hoping that whatever concerned him on this journey was light-weight because he wouldn’t want to lose whatever marbles he had left.\nHow could he cope, knowing that his life was five seconds away from death at any moment? At one point, he was in a persistent state of denial after seeing adventurers succeed left and right. The daily quests made it easy for him to fall into a routine of comfort and stability, making the idea of chaos similar to that of a nightmare that one easily grew out of as the days passed.\nInstead of getting used to it, his mind was much more sensitive to pain and fear now. But he had new ways to cope with and understand the world around him, empowered.\nEven if he was sure that he could find the answers to numerous unresolved issues and concerns , his head was too full right now.\nWhile he rested, Michel kept her distance from him, prioritizing interacting with and responding to the soldiers and adventurers stationed at the border. However, this distance was space for him.\nMatthew collected his thoughts, but they never found a sense of integrity.\nHe exhaled gradually, processing the painful tightness of his calves, arms, and back and the itchiness of his hands, legs, and feet. Even if he could magically heal them, he allowed the pain to settle until his mind accepted and understood them in a complete sense. Then, he healed them, praying that he remembered things that made him human—pain, struggle, and ambition. He was free.\nBut that feeling of freedom dissipated after a while, and now he stood up, allowing Michel to come close since he had been huffing and groaning every time she did earlier. This was a very instinctive and emotional reaction to what Michel said earlier. To conclude, his cognitive dissonance manifested as strange, alienating physical behavior.\n“I can’t completely block out myself,” he said. “Soon enough, I will have to come out running.”\nNext, Matthew weakly reflected on everything that emerged in his mind throughout the course of fifteen minutes before he truely engaged with Michel in conversation. Previously, he was only giving short answers, often just yesses or nos.\n“My humanity is bearing on me despite my desires for perfection. Despite my ideals, my human mind and body have limitations.”\n“I have to learn how to accept grief and loss, but my mind is in a rhythm of confusion.”\nIn his mind, he fell apart sooner or later, and he further dismantled himself, opening up room for assembly.\nEarlier, he agreed to go with Michel. Nonetheless, now, he decided to stop and take a break, and Michel approved this. Though, her overall response was simple, so he trusted her to deal with her own issues.\nIn the end, Matthew acknowledged that he had overextended himself today, which left him the emotional and mental wreck he was now. This was the mistake he had avoided successfully with his first adventurer party, but he was a lot more alert and tense during that time. Now, he had flown too close to the sun due to his newfound levels of comfort and stability. In other words, he had struggled to his breaking point, and he had pushed himself to failure. This was his bodybuilding journey.\nMoving forward, the best way to avoid overextension was a combination of systematic preparation and moderation.\nSo for the time being, he would focus on himself. He decided to go to the most beginner levels where monsters weaker than goblins, such as slimes, rats, bats, kobolds, skeletons, zombies, imps, and spiders, roamed.\nThe tropical rainforest was separated linearly between beginner levels and harder levels; though, the balance often blurred since monsters roamed a lot. But for the most part, the regularity of spawning made it so that monsters just kept to their areas—an ecosystem of spawning.\nThere, he found himself matching up with a slime; however, he found himself unable to kill it. In fact, the slime consumed three spears. Since he was struggling by himself, he thought that it would be a good idea to hire adventurers. Instead of setting up a quest that anyone could take, he thought about hiring specific adventurers. Furthermore, he was sure that he could set parameters or conditions for the type of adventurers his proposed quest would have in mind. This way, he could go through the standard process of setting up accessible quests while satisfying his particular requirements.\nOnce he reached the adventurer guild, he soon learned from the receptionist that it was standard to have quest conditions. However, he had never learned this since only the registered representatives of registered adventurer parties were permitted to view the quest board.\nSo, after putting up a quest, he waited at a cafe, wondering if using the quest board as a way to monitor the activities of adventurers throughout the city could provide him an edge in this world. However, he presumed that if the quest board could be exploited this way, then numerous others were already doing the same. In particular, he knew that the adventurer guild likely sent their intelligence to the noble families presiding over the current large territory.\nSo he had a long way to go before he had any sway in politics, but he wanted to focus on the ideal of the free market system, which meant creating a product or service and selling it. If advancing his skills simply as an adventurer met his needs and expectations and those of society, then he would be content.\nSpeaking of the free market, he remembered the late golem maker who almost got him ambushed and slain by goblins, and he wondered what was his motive behind arranging a trap for unsuspecting adventurers.\nWhile waiting for adventurers to take his quest, he began pondering in his cottage where failed drawing attempts of maps littered across the table.\n“Has it happened before? And why are there no news or reports of missing adventurers? Is it so common for adventurers to die that no reports are made? That’s impossible. There’s gotta be a report somewhere, considering that the particular ambush location was not so far from the beginner levels. Yet, it’s hard to say how frequent the ambushes were held. Did they happen bimonthly or everyday? Everyday is impossible, but maybe rare enough that no one would suspect it to be unnatural. Yet, the golem maker successfully did it long enough that he almost practically let himself get caught by not taking account of the fact that I can easily tell others about the secret hunting location. I don’t understand what was the point of doing that. Now, he’s executed. Did he make a very bad mistake? Why? There must be some rationale behind making such a big mistake.” He never really resolved this issue, but the fact that it happened in front of him, involving him first and foremost.\nHe had to find out exactly the underpinnings of the golem maker if he wanted to create an effective service like a startup that could disrupt the industry and become a giant. Moreover, such an industry giant would provide a basis for his own personal growth as an adventurer and fighter. He saw the golem maker as a precedent or case study for customer profiling, risk assessment, avoiding similar mistakes that compromised long term viability, strategic analysis, and understanding what drove different actors in this society.\nHe stopped for a moment and took a breather. This was only the tip of the iceberg. If he wanted to unravel this society and make it into something akin to his own personal smartphone, then he would have to find a strategy that would be nerfed by developers if it was in a video game.\nSo he visited the place where he met the golem maker.\nChapter 11 - Lost in Translation: Seeking Understanding in a Foreign Realm linkBy detail, the place in which the late golem maker had resided was large, fitting several different compartments that all looked like one small family. If a family did live here, it would feel like foreigners had taken over the city. Moreover, Matthew glimpsed into the various scratchy sides of the shelves and the small dents and dusty specks fomenting allergy-inspired coughs. The cracked cobblestone wall held together by a passively humming magical essence suffused him with a sense of place, warding him from mental fog. This light-bringing moment of contact engaged him with the emotional residues that guided this place’s hollowed seats where the buttocks received a mark. In this careful shine, he received the gift of peace.\nHe mindfully waited for his feelings to pass and then alighted mentally upon a platform of analysis.\nFor context, when he arrived at the place, it was abandoned, and kids frolicked outside the cottage. As soon as he arrived, he found himself being stared at accusingly by several passersby. This didn’t dissuade him; instead, it made him eager to try.\nWhen he reached the door of the cottage, he wanted to be sure his nose was working before he sniffed for any suspicious smell. If he detected a body, he would leave.\nWhen he didn’t, he moved to the next stage of his investigation: he entered the household.\nEntering the place was like eating gravel because it was a dark and moody place that could perfectly accomodate a witch or some dark creature of magic.\nWhen moving deep inside confirmed that he was safe, he allowed himself to relax.\nHe experienced this feeling of danger, tension, and inappropriate awe for the beauty, mystique, novel excitement, and implicit complexity involved every time he went on quests, walked around the city, or did anything in this world.\nAfter all, this was Earth in an alternate universe, albeit hypothetically.\nSoon enough, he realized that the cottage visit was fruitless, but he did learn that people liked to keep potions. This was a trend he also noticed in Michel’s house.\nFor some reason, all of this trends began to eat up at his mind. He mentally retrieved everything from his past on Earth all the way to the past two months to now.\nHe broke and allowed himself to fall to his knees with his forearms resting against the ground.\nAfter he spent 45 minutes in that position to contemplate, the [System] recognized his efforts.\nYou’ve leveled up your wellbeing by diving into the past and crafting a stronger, more authentic version of yourself. 🚀 Way to go, champ! 🌟 Here’s 10 XP to boost your progress even further! 💥\n“The fuck… When did I become a statistic?” He was serious for a moment before he burst into genuine laughter. “What the hell is me…” He smiled, tears dripping down, before he stared at the dark, seeing two eyes staring back at him.\n“Oh, fuck.” Chills spread throughout his back. He got up and ran, as a disgusting man slid to him briefly.\nHe screamed.\nThe man ate his arm.\nHe slapped the man and kicked, as the man kept at it.\nHe cried hellishly, tinges of pain bursting throughout his body.\nHis neck felt the sharpness of a tooth.\nHe fell to the ground before he plunged a spear above him.\nHe fell unconscious for a moment before he shifted his arm, finding support on the floor. He pushed himself up and supported his whole body, getting up on his feet. When he looked down, he saw the man still on the ground.\n“The fuck!” He jumped away before he tried to heal himself instinctively.\nAs time passed, he looked where his right arm used to be. It never growed back.\nThe lying man moved.\nMatthew started barking hilariously, but it was out of terror.\nHe ran outside, and his voice caught wind, as people began walking toward him.\nHe begged, getting the help of an adventurer party.\nThe lying man crawled away, slowing down in front of the wall where he opened a portal with subdued colors. After he entered, the adventurer party entered, finding blood on the ground and bits of Matthew’s flesh. It was a good thing they saw the portal or they might report Matthew for lying.\nMatthew was saved, but he didn’t know what he was experiencing. He took a risk and went somewhere not safe, and the streets were strangely safer.\nHe lay down and let his head rest. Too much thinking would ruin him.\nSoon, the next day came, and his heart pumped, remembering what happened. “This doesn’t make sense. This is not orderly or structured. There needs to be a reason why such a creature was in these parts. Can I… I need to ask someone regarding how creatures are spread throughout the region. If I can identify exactly what species that creature was, then good. But, but, but… what the hell am I doing? Is that creature a creature? Or is it a human with a particular set of skills that look like a creature’s? I don’t know. I’m being assumed to know everything around here. Why is everyone expecting me to understand when the only logic I know is being an adventurer? That’s logical to me. Not this… shit!”\nHe drank water before he looked outside the window, vocalizing himself in his inn room more angrily than he had ever done. “Cars don’t just hit people. Okay, maybe they do. But is that a car? That? A car? A random creature? Factor or some stupid ass thing! What in the world determines whether a thing carries the characteristics a car holds in terms of death rates? How the hell am I supposed to know that when there’s no Internet. I live in the fucking modern day, and all of this is just unknown or unspecific to me. People… please tell me what the hell your rates and numbers are. I need to know the statistics and info and shit! If you guys don’t tell me, I will very strictly remind you guys that this is absolutely necessary for my sanity. Why is no one telling me anything! Why the hell am I expected to do everything! Everyone’s always busy, and I cannot ask just any question because if I ask basic questions, how long can I keep that up? Who the hell is willing to answer me? They’re all giving answers based on things that are naturally confusing or nuanced to people in this world. But for me! For me? I have no clue what the hell is going on, so all your nuanced talks is even more confusing! The basic shit is what I want. Give me the basic rudimentary rudiments! Please! I beg, I beg, I beg. I just need to have all of this together. Why are you guys testing me! Is this a test, God? God, please tell me what the hell am I doing? Why am I here, listening to these people tell me about things that I have no fucking clue about! Am I just supposed to ask what the hell a goblin is? Why do these people assume goblins? Why don’t they ask, ‘What’s their body weight?’, ‘What’s your… life about in scientific terms?’, ‘What’s your parameters with biological properties and stuff?’ How the hell am I expected to excel in a world that doesn’t tell me what the fuck is going on specifically?” His voiced dropped to a mocking tone. “Oh, just kill this goblin. Use method one. Use method two! Like, that’s so easy! But it’s not just goblins, is it? It’s not just fucking goblins! I have to concern myself with all of your bullshit, and I don’t know half whatever’s going on in this world. You have to joking with me. Like, seriously! Tell me first what the hell you guys think a car is. Give me a clue as to what the hell you guys think of anything. It’s like you guys are so comfortable with things, and you guys assume me to know everything! I don’t know what the hell you guys are doing anyway! So please… tell me. Help me someone. I need books. Stuff. A manual. A guide. Not this ‘How to kill goblins’ advice. No. That’s not enough. That’s so, so easy. It’s the hard part. The hard part… being when all the factors just don’t compute. It just doesn’t make sense. What’s a spell? What are the spells? Oh, your spell is secret? Oh, I guess I assume. But what am I assuming? What are the expected spells! What the hell are the assumed spells! Fireball? Magic blast something? Tell me! I need someone who knows I’m from Earth and is willing to tell me what the hell is going on. Oh, wait, Sophia was willing to talk to me. But I still don’t trust her yet. Fuck! I didn’t like the fact that she’s a healer. It’s like I’m being forced to be on her side because whatever happens, she needs to be there. I’m not sure I can trust someone so stable and integrated in this society. How the hell am I supposed to know if I can ask her all my concerns? Okay, that’s stupid. You know what? I’ll ask her. I’ll do it. I was not really thinking or willing to do it, but maybe, she’ll tell me everything. Does she even know? From what I can tell, no one even knows what’s going on. So I doubt it. I doubt she’ll be able to tell me anything I don’t know. Or maybe I’m wrong… Of course I’m wrong. Ahh… At this point, I was just feeling weird. Ugh. I got a little bothered by the… stuff. Ah, shit. Okay, if I just go to Sophia, she’ll tell me what I need to know… hopefully.”\nWhen he went to Sophia, she looked friendly and welcoming, so he decided to start with, “You know it’s weird.”\nA moment later, when she finally turned to him and asked what, he continued, “I have no idea what’s happening.”\nSophia nodded before stopping midway. Then, she looked up and and raised her brows, going through a mix of emotions such as confusion and suspicion. In the end, she settled with a confused squint and frown. “What… do… you… mean?”\n“What is it that is going on?”\n“What?”\n“Do you know what’s going on?”\n“Yeah… To a certain extent…”\n“I have no clue what’s going on.”\n“Okay?”\n“Can you tell me what’s going on?”\n“Sure…”\n“What the hell happened to Michel?”\n“Uh…”\n“Don’t say you don’t know.”\n“It depends.”\n“Okay.”\n“It depends on who you ask, and I haven’t been able to talk to her lately—”\n“Ugh.”\n“I didn’t really ask her, and I am not the one who has to check if she’s doing anything illegal or anything. I… We don’t do that. There’s already a system for checking whether adventurers are killing people or doing something really bad.”\n“So I can try… to, you know, put my hopes in that… person.”\n“Okay, to recount from her time in Blades, she wasn’t so available. She had other concerns, and she was mostly active during the actual quests when Michael was there.” For context, Michael was the former leader of Matthew’s first adventurer party.\n“Brackern?”\n“What?”\n“Who’s that?\n“You know him. He was talking to you and showing you the ropes when it came to footwork.”\n“Yeah, he taught me that, but I wasn’t really participating that time.”\n“It’s fine. The point is that you do know him and have spent time with him, yes?”\n“Yeah, but I don’t know him.”\n“You don’t need to know.”\n“I want to know about him.”\n“Why?”\n“I want to start somewhere.”\n“What makes him so… something that you’d want to ask first… about?”\n“He was one person that I remember from when, you know, everything happened.”\n“Ugh, you were talking to him. That was you.”\n“Yeah, how… I don’t remember…”\n“I saw. So Brackern is currently twenty…-seven. And he doesn’t really have anything to do with the party anymore, like… everyone else. \"\n“That’s not… That’s just age.”\n“What do you want?”\n“I want to know his current circumstances, if possible.”\n“I don’t know. I didn’t really check. Like I said, I’m not the one who checks.”\n“Why?”\n“Michel was probably the one supposed to, at least, concern with people of the group. But she is not active really.”\n“Okay.”\n“I don’t like to talk about this.”\n“Why… Oh.”\n“Yeah. See. You’re fine. It’s just you need time to think about it… okay… yourself.”\n“I need people to tell me exactly what’s going on, though.”\n“That’s the thing. I cannot ask others. You’re going to have to ask them though. So…”\n“Okay. I… just want to say thanks.” He was thanking her for saving him from death on his first day here in this world.\n“Right, yeah, that’s fine. It’s good to see you… but you have to be going because I have to sleep… and clean up… and… everything else… that if you want to know how to do everyday stuff, you can ask me. Or just have me clean your cottage if you want.”\n“You know I have a cottage. That was very recent though.”\n“That’s something I only know because of Deathbringer.”\n“I didn’t really tell…”\n“Well, I don’t know.”\nFor some reason, after the discussion, Matthew felt frustrated. No, he knew why he was frustrated. Sophia didn’t give him the answers that he was looking for. He gritted his teeth, his frustration entering his bones. He was becoming an angrier man by the day.\nIf he could just grab the neck of someone and get them to tell him what the hell was going on, then maybe things would work out.\nBut he had money, so he could buy information. That was lateral thinking there.\nSo he went to the guild and tried to ask, using a piece of paper to remember his list of questions.\nHe was told to wait, while the receptionist finished several people’s business.\nIn the meantime, he pointed his focus inward. His neurotic state was bothering him. When did he become so irrational? It was the mounting expectations and responsibilities, and he didn’t feel compensated with enough information and resources to move forward, resulting in burnout. He knew exactly why, so all he had to do was calm the heck down.\nBut things were going so well. Indeed, it was after the coalition attack against the hobgoblins that he started getting so weird and emotional.\nTo be fair, he achieved so much by participating in several big events and achieving so many things in the last two months. So his current troubled state felt logical in retrospect.\nBut he didn’t want to have limitations. He was tired of being tired.\nHis face twitched with anger, and his ambition and worst thoughts flared up.\nHe would become the epitome of grace and beauty. He would eat all of these losers up. He would control them and make them utterly obedient to him. He was tired of their disrespectful prideful attitudes of not telling him what the hell was going on. He would make sure they listened to him next to him. They were all so stupid for not even thinking for one second.\nHis logic counterbalanced his irrational thoughts.\nBut to be fair, he wasn’t actively communicating to the two parties about everything he knew and what he didn’t understand. So it was obvious why he was frustrated. He presumed that he was a challenge to the parties to deal with as well.\nA pang of guilt stabbed him, and he realized that he could have been so much better. While rubbing his eye, he stopped and regained his composure as soon as the receptionist gestured that she was ready to take his questions.\n“I want to know the different types of goblins?”\n“Different types?” said the receptionist. “You mean different tribes, communities, regions?”\n“Yeah, yeah…”\nSo he was given a history lesson on goblins that many would consider tedious, but because of that, he felt much better. Having basic historical knowledge made life easier.\nAnd the receptionist didn’t even make him pay. Matthew thought the man probably pitied him for being so dumb, but he recognized that this perpective was still too extreme.\nHe understood that his thirst, hunger, and lack of sleep contributed to his stress, which impinged upon his cognitive abilities for the meantime. So he decided to eat and drink some water now that he had a source of information—the receptionist at the guild.\nHe smiled at the receptionist before leaving, thanking him again.\nHe ruminated over making sure that he took care of all the various factors that impaired memory, decision-making, problem-solving, processing speed, and managing time and resources effectively. He wrote these down by memory and got to work in brainstorming for ways to improve his health and wellbeing so he wouldn’t suddenly lose his rationality.\nThroughout his time here in this world, he nearly died several times, and he put himself in situations that could have left him dead.\nHe laughed. Maybe, he became crazy after he became tortured on his first day here.\nEven if he wasn’t crazy, all that drive and rapid progress had to have a sugar crash sooner or later.\nHe returned to rationality.\nAfter he fell asleep and took a break and worked at his employee relations job for a week, he returned to the receptionist to ask more questions.\nThe receptionist stood straight, his form creating waves of glory behind him. His presence was empowering, and his eyes were fierce like a tiger’s. His soul took form as a fluttering cape that he removed and placed down. The fervor in his steps and gestures was overwhelming, grabbing the attention of those in the guild. Matthew didn’t realize it before, but he saw it now.\n“I want to ask more questions about this world.” Matthew intentionally added “this world” to gauge the receptionist’s reaction.\nThe receptionist didn’t look too suspicious, so Matthew continued, “Excuse me, are you busy?”\nAfter the receptionist turned his attention to him, he repeated his first question today.\n“Why do you want to know?” said the receptionist, glancing at the other adventurers in the guild. Yesterday, it was empty, but today, dozens of adventurers lined up to get coffee at the bar inside the guild.\nMatthew guessed that the receptionist was concerned about the privacy of their discussion.\nAfter the receptionist stared for a while, Matthew smiled and said, “I don’t know much about this place.”\nThe receptionist tilted his head smoothly, having glanced at one adventurer in the guild in particular several times since Matthew started talking. “Then, let’s start.” He gestured to a woman sitting, drinking, and laughing at a table inside. After confirming to the confused woman, she went and replaced him as receptionist for now.\nIn the meantime, the receptionist whom Matthew had asked went around the counter and sat down at a table, gesturing Matthew to sit across from him.\nAs soon as Matthew sat down, the receptionist smiled with mischievous eyes. “You know why I answered your question yesterday.”\n“Why…?”\n“Because you looked lost. So I thought you needed someone to talk to before you fell asleep. I didn’t know you actually needed that information.”\n“I did?” He wondered if the receptionist meant ‘drunk’ by ’lost.’ When the receptionist stayed silent for his answer, Matthew continued: “Yeah, I didn’t know what was going on. I was born yesterday, I guess.” He rubbed the back of his hair and looked away, smiling sheepishly.\n“Well, it’s a good thing you’re here, because I’m a part of an information management team dedicating to helping clueless people like you.”\nFor some reason, despite the professional language, Matthew thought the receptionist’s tone had a hint of mockery there at the end. But if he was right, it was most likely in good humor. Due to the receptionist’s commanding presence and importance as a reliable source of information to Matthew, he was apprehensive even with his tone of voice now.\nThe receptionist introduced himself as “Rodney Callous.”\n“Can we start?” he said, smiling for a microsecond before he stood up and motioned five people sitting down casually at a four-seat table to come over.\nWhen they walked up to Rodney, they side-eyed Matthew up and down.\nMeanwhile, Matthew tried to straighten himself more than he already was, thinking that he might have been accidentally lying down carelessly without realizing. If he missed the opportunity to gain their approval, he would isolated in his concerns again, so he looked like the very shy, shaky, introverted boy he was as a child.\nChapter 12 - The Path to Discovery: Unveiling Magic and Inner Struggles linkAccompanied by his usual mix of nervousness and determination, Matthew said, “I want to know about magic.”\nAs soon as Rodney let the five people sit down at the nearest table, he explained, “Remember about the different goblin tribes? Now magic this is going to be harder to explain. So you have a skill of your own, right? If not one, then two?”\n“I don’t have any.”\n“That’s strange. Five-year-olds get their first skill.”\nMatthew’s eyes widened. He realized that it might take being five years in this world for him to get a skill.\nRodney continued: “If you don’t have your skill, that must mean your growth is delayed somehow. How old did you say you were?”\n“I didn’t say… I’m currently 25.”\n“That’s interesting because I’m not entirely sure why your skill is not yet there. But it’s probably what I said. So in order for me to show you about skills, I would have to tell you my skill, but that’s against policy. We don’t share skills. No one does. So I have an idea, albeit a tried and common idea. Let’s visit the tournaments. We should be able to identify their skills and ask them about it. I don’t know if they’ll actually use it since even with the tournaments they can attend, it isn’t a definite if they’ll use their abilities or not. But we can try and see.”\n“Tournaments?”\n“Prisoners go there, so if you want to see what real fighters are like, you can start there.”\n“Magic?”\n“Uh-huh,” he said theatrically. “Real magic!”\n“Why help me?”\n“You look lost… still.”\nMatthew went through a shift of emotions, mostly negative, but he decided that he wouldn’t force his questions too much. He remembered a time when he was burned out because people were so unpredictable to him, and this new world reintroduced that same time of his life.\nBut he resigned himself to patience and for the long-term game. “We scale,” he said, remembering his siblings and a game they enjoyed.\nNow, they were gone.\nFerocity faintly gripped his posture, but he continued to sit as though he was a dove or a feather.\nHe smiled.\nMoments later, Rodney stood up and guided Matthew and the five people to a tournament past the roads and the trees in a remote clearing where many plant-eating animals roamed and avoided them.\nThe tournament didn’t take place in a colosseum, but it was open where people could breathe the wind and hear the rustling of the trees a few feet nearby.\nThe fighting happened with a large, transparent magic shield enclosing the contestants, while the spectators watched outside.\n“This looks more convenient,” Matthew said, catching Rodney’s side glance. It was the fact that he said “more” that was telling, but Matthew was executing these “telling” actions on purpose to get information indirectly.\nIn the distance, Matthew noticed the brutalist features present in the buildings of the city. He often associated brutalism with dystopias, but for some reason, the warmer colors and textures involved in these buildings gave a lively feel amid the sterile or lifeless implications of brutalism. But what was most prominent and unique about the architecture was the seemingly impractical use of wood. His first assumption was that magic could be used to mitigate or even effectively eliminate the issues of using wood for buildings. In conclusion, the combination of wood and brutalist features took his imagination to a place far removed from anything he had experienced before.\nHe wondered if this clearing, this particular place, was isolated from the rest of the world. He got the feeling that he was in a small village in a middle of nowhere and slowly advancing in terms of strength from this area. In contrast, being in the city looked and felt very urban, so the fast pace and high expectations and burnout associated with it was there. But this place was free from that. It was isolated and freeing like a place where he could focus on gathering his strength on his own pace without any interruptions, disruptions, or expectations. He could grow in power while no one was aware.\nIn short, the area where the tournament was held felt like an idyllic, slow-living, breathable village where he could sit down and do whatever he wanted, stretch and work out, and drink and eat.\nThis place made him feel sleepy, especially now that it was the afternoon. Moreover, he was still in the process of catching up on sleep or paying his “sleep debt” that had accumulated from his many limit-breaking past endeavors.\nAt the three-day tournament, for the most part, it was a bunch of people fighting, but over the course of three days, he identified numerous skills. Moreover, he also heard a bunch of posh teenagers talking about goblins in tournaments.\nThough, he focused his attention on one of them to start.\nSurefire Surge (Level 1)\nCost: 50 Mana\nCooldown: 10\nCast Time: 0.25\nEffect Radius: 200\nActive: The user erupts in a fiery surge, dealing magic damage to all nearby enemies over 3 seconds. Enemies caught in the surge are burned for additional damage over time.\nMagic Damage per Second: 28 (20 +20%🔥+5%🪓+5%🪓)\nAdditional Burn Damage: 15.5 (10 +10%🔥+5%🪓+5%🪓)\nTotal Magic Damage: 84 (60 +60%🔥+15%🪓)\nEnemies burned by Surefire Surge have their armor reduced by 5% for the duration.\nMatthew found out that the symbols 🔥 and 🪓 referred to ability power and attack damage, respectively.\nNow that he had a better grasp of fighting and skills, he considered if he could expand his influence by engaging in the merchant selling that he remembered Ella and some of the others engaged in. If he wanted to increase his power and active grasp of this world, then he needed more resources.\nHowever, he already had a lot to work in, and he could list them all.\nTo draft a list, his resources at the moment included the receptionist currently helping him; his first adventurer party, particularly Brandon, Brackern, Deathbringer, Sophia, and Michel; his second adventurer party, including Prism, Ella, Ada, Kairo, and Echo; and his current employee relations job; the six adventurers; the inn patrons of Block \u0026 Bed Tavern; the Tamer and the other adventurers associated with her; the employees and clients of the goblin worker shop where he worked in employee relations; the adventurer he met before the Mawkery attack, Desmond Leroy, if he was still alive; the knowledge and skills he had gained from his experiences so far as an adventurer, including warding skills and understanding of combat situations; among others.\nSo he was probably overextending himself instead of focusing on what he had momentarily, but he didn’t want to miss out on the opportunity that Rodney provided him. He would definitely go back and reunite with everyone, address concerns, and consolidate them to maximize the effectiveness of this network.\nAnyway, to consolidate previous points, Rodney’s focused guidance helped Matthew move past feeling isolated and adrift as the sole outsider, imbuing a greater sense of social connection and community support. His guidance was extremely important for Matthew’s development going forward.\nFurthermore, despite knowing many people in this new world, Matthew was still struggling to find his bearings and make sense of everything. Having so many acquaintances didn’t necessarily translate to feeling truly understood or supported.\nHis relationships with the people he already knew were still somewhat superficial.\nHe had not developed a high level of trust or emotional vulnerability with any of them yet.\nRodney’s neutrality as an outsider to Matthew’s personal experiences allowed for a more open exchange. Even brief interactions with understanding strangers could make a big difference when one was feeling lost and overwhelmed.\nIn short, feeling truly seen and understood made all the difference, even from unexpected sources.\nRodney continued on this trend with a relieving catch: “Do you want to talk to a skill practitioner, the kind that addresses any concerns of newbies? We have one here, but he’s going to cost you. In fact, I’m going to cost you. I know you have money, so if you’re willing to pay, then we can move forward. Are you willing to spend your money to break through your current limitations?”\nUsually, Matthew would be reserved, but he was willing to pay since that was the point of his employee relations job. It was to stabilize growth trends by anchoring them with a secure, reliable income. Plus, having removed that worry weighing on his mind about what Rodney’s motivations were for helping him controlled things. It was easier to work with someone with a clear, obvious motive like money than something vague like kindness. Since he didn’t know Rodney that well, it was safer and more reliable to be clear more than anything.\nAfter some routine clarifications, bargaining, and payment, the recommended skill practitioner began teaching Matthew about specific skills and trends in how skills were used, mentioning different environments and how various skills could be adapted for them.\nThe practitioner smiled. “[Basic Unravel]” he said, casting his skill on Matthew.\nMatthew stared, feeling the stars align as hundreds of words and symbols entered his mind one by one in quick succession.\nHis mind flew in many different directions, representing his confusion since he entered this world almost three months ago, before settling in clarity.\nEven though the skill belonged to the practitioner, [Basic Unravel] gave Matthew the knowledge that doing good deeds could lead to acquired skills and showed various real montages of people getting skills from doing good deeds.\nMatthew fell to the ground, as a surge of confidence filled his being. This surge stemmed from the empowering feeling of seeing tangible and concrete stories of people getting skills. This was contrasted by the mysterious and abstract nature of his experiences during the past several days.\nMoreover, [Basic Unravel] began the second stage, showing him montages of people using skills. In particular, it showed a basic skill that involved a three-pronged strike with shadowy forms attacking simultaneously with the caster. Second, it showed another basic skill that a dash that taunted enemy monsters. This dash involved passing through the targets. Third, it showed an ‘ultimate’ skill where the user charged unstoppably for a long distance, pushing or trampling over enemies, before stopping at a wall or after hitting a heavy enough enemy.\nHaving collasped from the intense feelings running through him, Matthew began laughing with euphoria.\nRodney began cocking his head up and down, his eyes wide and sternly confused.\n“That’s weird,” said the practitioner. “Is he…?”\n“Maybe,” Rodney said, his baffled expression in stark contrast with his stationary, cross-armed posture.\nMatthew saw the [System] beginning to show a variety of different skill options in holographic cards.\nIn the meantime, Rodney and the practitioner stared at him.\nSome time after Matthew calmed down somewhat, the practitioner began preparing himself to explain about common adventurer career paths and typical progression routes.\nAfter Matthew finally stood up, the practitioner explained. He also added that Rodney could share access to training opportunities.\n“You can couple support skills with more combat ones for a balanced approach,” he concluded, entrusting Matthew to Rodney.\nSubsequently, Rodney said that if Matthew didn’t want to pay for training, he said that books could supplement future training.\nIn addition, with Rodney’s cue, his information team told him that they could integrate him with the broader cohort of up-and-coming adventurers that they personally sponsored. They emphasized in casual terms that social support was important during a difficult adjustment.\nUltimately, Matthew had been speechless for a while, as he still had the [System] showing him eight skill options to choose from.\nHe chewed over which skill would help him engage and disengage or avoid interaction with the enemy the most while still doing tons of damage.\nHe only got a slap on the wrist in the form of a brief disapproving look for having that weird euphoric laughing moment he had earlier.\nIn the end, with this powerup, he might finally start hunting goblins alone. But part of him wanted to capture and control goblins more than anything, so that he could develop them into more permanent security assets. But goblin enslavement was regulated, but he might find a way to characterize it as integration rather than exploitation.\nIncidentally, Matthew noticed a bunch of kids walking by. They were the kids from the cottage of the late golem maker, the ones who were present when he visited it.\nAnyway, he remembered that he was in the tournament, so he paid attention to the crowds before hearing their cheers grow in power until he couldn’t handle it anymore.\nHe left the scene, shepherding Rodney and his team toward a cafe the next day.\nAs soon as he reached the cafe, they thanked him for the coffee, and soon, three of Matthew’s acquaintances arrived, opening up discussion about the new hobgoblin-human alliance and potential opportunities for merchants.\nThese three were Ella, Nova, and a close friend of Marcher, Marsh Cranberry.\nLooking at them, Matthew knew that even after everything, he couldn’t mold people to his ideals. He couldn’t truly force his future child to grow up to be like him. He couldn’t force friends and acquaintances to do what he wanted all the time. They were out of his control, and he couldn’t force them to open up and become exploitable resources for him. He couldn’t easily break them and make them become like slaves. They were going to leave him or stay, depending on their choice. He would have to move on and let go of people, focusing on those who chose to stay. Moreover, he would meet people who’d become his close friends for a few days only, but that was natural and a part of life. He would have to recognize that people were not things he could control. He couldn’t constantly check up on people in order to maintain connections with them and expect them to be there always. Not everyone would stay, and not everyone would leave. But time changed people, and sooner or later, even if they didn’t leave, it would feel like they did.\nHe couldn’t control the world like he wanted, and he would have to focus on his own journey while still relying on his current support network.\nThis was reality.\nConversations and laughter filled the air, transitioning Matthew out of his thoughts.\nHe saw the people he was currently with, and he wondered if they would experience things pivotal enough together that he would remember them well many years from now.\nBut for some reason, Matthew couldn’t shake the feeling that he wanted to become everything—destabilizing the power landscape and advancing his personal agenda.\nWhile thinking, he heard Ella say that one of her adventurer friends was killed in action, which was unfortunately not uncommon. It was rarer to have an adventurer missing in action since they often operated in parties, and parties frequently logged where they were going and their performance with copious detail to prevent parties from taking on missions too hard for them. However, not everything was accounted for, and inevitably, unique monsters and situations would emerge that difficulty accessors couldn’t prepare adventurers for.\nIf Matthew showcased his rageful drive now, he would just look immature since effective communication and emotional management were key traits of maturity. However, some situations constructively called for well-managed, almost perfomative rage.\nFeeling mentally drained, he discovered himself focusing on the food in front of him. It was reminiscient of his favorite home dish, pork sisig.\nHe wondered if he could kill a goblin next time. The time since his last goblin kill was long, and after his recent experiences, he was starting to doubt his capacity for wanton violence. If he could kill before, then he could do it again. But reflection made him confront his underlying feelings, those that he had pushed back to adjust to this new world. If these feelings told him that he didn’t want to kill goblins out of explosive guilt, then he could only stop killing them. But he didn’t want to let that guilt control him, yet he did want to be human. It was difficult for him to compromise, and ignoring his feelings would only make things worse in the long run, especially considering how irrational he became the last several days.\nHe had to do something. He had to integrate fully into this new world, but his conscience prevented him. Maybe, he could just be in the world, not of this world.\nHowever, he had to bear and bury his conscience for now. He told it to shut up.\nYet, due to the strain, flashbacks from the time he was tortured and almost killed reappeared in his head, making him hyperventilate for half a second before he took control as usual. Since it was quick and subdued, no one noticed it.\nSeveral other flashbacks from his past violent experiences made this brief panic attack repeat. This was more than just a physical reaction. His throat would suddenly beg to be choked until he fell limp.\nHe continued aiming to stomp this reaction, but he only subdued it instead of removing the condition entirely.\nHe hated how fragile his mind was, but he whispered, his right hand shaking briefly, “Slowly but surely.”\nHe was well-adapted to dealing with his mental condition, so he could still operate on a rational basis as long as he managed his stress well. This was a glimpse at how he had been problem-solving with the effects of trauma in a systematic manner—an intellectual feat, especially with how he had functioned for so long. He considered himself a lucky man.\nHe met so many people in his life, especially those who would never address problems, so he made it a point to keep his own issues in front of his face. He couldn’t pretend for so long.\nGetting tortured was not a story someone told him. It was his firsthand experience, and during that time, he felt like he wasn’t there anymore. It wasn’t him anymore.\nHe was God and the euphoria that disjointedly combined with his torturous pain made him want to leap into God’s arms.\nOf course, he had to perform and pretend because if not, he would lose everything.\nHe was a rational man. He would become the man for the job.\nHe had to become everything.\nHe fell apart.\nOutside, he was still, catatonic-like.\nHe needed to break this trend of weakness and helplessness. So he slowly transitioned his thoughts toward healthy distractions such as food and good company.\nThis broke his spell.\nChapter 13 - Overcoming the Struggles of the Mind: Matthew’s Path to Greatness linkMatthew was notably very sick mentally, but that didn’t stop him from achieving great things.\nReturning to reality, Matthew had intended for Rodney and his team to leave him after the tournament, so that he could focus on going on his solo adventuring to test out his new skill. Though, he hadn’t chosen yet. But instead, Rodney expressed that he was willing to keep helping Matthew for now. As a result, Matthew parted ways temporarily with them, and he went to invite his adventurer friends to the cafe tomorrow. But only Ella and Nova agreed to come or actually came. Moreover, The third adventurer, Marsh Cranberry, only followed along. In conclusion, the day after the tournament, he went to the cafe where he met Rodney and his team and the three adventurers.\nHe already thought of ways to incentivize the three adventurers to collaborate with him, so he opened up a discussion about their career and personal goals as he had done with the six adventurers.\nAfter conversing for a while, Matthew remembered that they had agreed to show him their skills. However, they had forgotten, and he hadn’t reminded them.\nOverall, the three each provided Matthew with a path forward. First, Ella presented a path toward her stranger skills and titles. Second, Nova suggested going to the dungeon steps since it was a safer way to get loot compared to heading into dungeons. Third, Marsh offered an opportunity to head into a village and visit the bazaar since he was itching for food.\nWhen it came to personal career goals, they each had their own. First, Ella was looking for ways to expand her skills through leveling them up by testing herself in various combat situations. So, she was okay with anything as long as it challenged her. If Matthew followed her lead on a quest that was difficult enough but not too difficult, that would satisfy her. Second, Nova had concerns about a coming goblin raid due to covert mobilization in the north, so he wanted to fix that problem first. His goal was staying alert, so he preferred to stand guard. His personal goal was protecting the city as a whole, not leaving even remote parts insufficiently protected. Third, Marsh was focused on selling villager goods as a merchant and a bazaar event organizer.\nMeanwhile, Matthew noticed a family with kids at the cafe, finding it very reminiscient of Earth. For some reason, he couldn’t shake the thought that if he decided to destroy this world, those people would be in the way. He realized that this world was too big to destroy, but magic could be like nukes. These thoughts were almost childish in its simplicity, but he was trying to see assess how all of these families and social structures came together to form the dynamic world he lived in alongside goblins, hobgoblins, and adventurers.\nBasically, he had to find ways to integrate himself with social structures more and more, diversifying his influences and intelligence sources. If he could develop immersion into a family, then he could understand the more underlying principles and motivators that drove human establishment and decision-making, especially in themes such as goblin handling.\nThis way, he could also develop evidence-backed solutions for more daring issues, expanding the process to a systematic level until he can effectively integrate various individuals within his region of control.\nHe wanted effectively to kill goblins in a system, casting a metaphorical highlight that rendered them actors under his tight stringing.\nThrough this approach, the erection of pockets of control or bridgeheads became natural.\nHe would marshal an army.\nAs he contemplated, self-important, grandiose thoughts like “I am the epitome of grace and beauty!” began to circle in his mind.\nRecognizing the dangers of this, he focused on calming his power hunger pangs in exchange for rational calm. Truly, torturous grit, or patience, was his friend and guiding light.\nHe stopped.\nReturning to reality, he took a sip from his deliciously bitter, 4-hour-old black coffee and continued listening to the others at the same table. From across the table, they were making eye contact with him while speaking.\nMatthew sustained a thoughtful smile. With a casual but polite posture, since he and everyone present started discussing, numerous of his expressive smiles endured, particularly in response to things Nova said and others that two of Rodney’s information team members said.\nTo everyone else, he was still the same awesome Matthew, and so he was.\nLater, they began their journey to the dungeon steps.\nBefore Matthew looked at his skill options, he assessed the city, having accumulated a mental library of knowledge since his first adventurer quest.\nIn terms of strategic terrain assessment, the city was located about 254 meters away from the nearest shore, that of a large lake. The beach consisted of various irregularities or distinct points that were of strategic concern. But “Point A,” the most valuable part of the beach, a corner tip, provided a very wide panorama into the lake with mainland protrusions unobtrusively distant on the left and the right. The right protrusion was the single big forested hill “Point B,” and the left protrusion was more level with the beach. Moreover, this left protrusion shared land with a slightly ascended, palm forest. Point A particularly was an extension of green land that made up most of the main land. In contrast, it was neighbored on the left by a sandy stretch of land that paused at another smaller protrusion that pointed to a 15-meter-square islet. Further inland from this protrusion lay a 39-meter-square lagoon. Point A was neighbored on the right by a hill that extended in a U-shape to Point B wherein the lake protruded inland. This lake protrusion was surrounded by this extended hill or ridge. Moving on to the mainland, Point A extended inland toward an expanse of rolling plains, starting off gentle but quickly growing hilly and rough to reach 11 meters in height. Moreover, the hills themselves were surrounded partially by a group of steep, densely forested mountains. Following the most level path to the city involved being surrounded by the taller hills and mountains and getting pressed between two hills at many points. Point C, a corner tip of the mountains provided the best panorama for both the mountains, the hills, the paths, the level plains, the beach, the lake, point A, point B, and the city itself. At night, it was practically invulnerable in terms of vision, and the bright city was particularly vulnerable. Furthermore, it provided a narrow path that extended smoothly enough to reach the nearest city building from a vantage point only 32 meters away. Overall, it provided good engage but bad disengage since it was a very steep cliff. Taking the more level route through the plains instead of the mountains led to a river 13 meters wide at its most narrow. However, this most narrow part would leave someone 111 meters farther than the shortest path, leaving space for the city to prepare since the land was now level and visible. Ignoring maritime obstacles, the shortest path to the village through the plains would lead to a 22-meter-wide part of the river and a 66-meter-long lake connected to the river. In conclusion, all of the objectives above, such as the extended hills and point C, if not defended, could be exploited by an invading enemy that arrived through an amphibious assault. In short, for invaders, their goal was to take objectives. For defenders, their goal was to defend them.\nPoint A and its relation to the city was only one broader front, considering that the city was neighbored by a gorge 59 meters away from the nearest building. The overall terrain was much more wider and had a lot more to consider strategically.\nAs for Matthew’s eight skill options, they varied.\nRapid Resonance (Level 1)\nCost: 100 Mana\nCooldown: 3 hours and 20 minutes\nCast Time: 0.5 seconds\nEffect Radius: 800 units\nActive: The user releases a resonating pulse, affecting all nearby allies and granting them increased attack speed and movement speed for 5 seconds.

After the whirlwind dissipates, affected enemies are slowed by 30% for 2 seconds.\nDuration: 4 seconds\nImmobilization Duration: 1.5 seconds\nSlow Duration: 2 seconds\nMatthew shouted, fighting alongside the adventurers. In the meantime, Rodney and his team were breaking block-shaped objects littered in the distance.\nAfter being distracted for a while, Matthew returned to assessment.\nMovements of the goblin troops were skewed to the left.\nFour adventurers were taking advantage of the chaos one adventurer provided.\nMatthew ran to the right, blocking a group of goblins from flanking the adventurers.\nHe punched the goblin on the face.\nThe goblins ganged up on him, jumping. In response, he used his skill: “[Whirlwind Waltz!]”\nThe goblins stopped for the stun duration.\nHe ravaged them, growling with a blend of euphoria and irritation.\nThe goblins fell one by one in a domino effect.\nHe kicked them, deflecting several blades by using his weight, taking severe damage.\nBut thanks to his healing, he retreated before goblin reinforcements caught him. However, as a consequence, several goblins escaped his assault, their faces distraught with fear.\nMatthew hesitated briefly before stomping a goblin’s head. “Stop!” he said at several goblins passing by him in the distance, his eyes wide.\nHe wasn’t angry. He was terrified. But he was in the zone like a painter with his pieces.\nHe roared.\nSeveral goblins retreated, respecting the close-range ferocity and healing he demonstrated.\nHe tried to grab one of them to punch them in the face.\nBut the goblins didn’t take the bait and kept running.\nIn the end, Matthew remembered his objectives, and he retreated before he overstayed.\nWhen he returned home, some street entertainers were dancing, their limbs taking various shapes and syncing various patterns with timing. In response, Matthew looked at his limbs, and he and the rest of the adventurers grinned.\nEarlier, Matthew, Ella, Nova, and Marsh Cranberry easily found a willing party to join to the dungeon steps, so currently, he was with eighteen other adventurers. It was a big party.\nMatthew remembered what he had to do, so the next day, he immediately contacted several older acquaintances again to meet. He wanted to get them on his level.\nHe was in a hurry, and he didn’t want to pretend and sit down.\nBut he would do this gradually.\nUltimately, he wanted to get all his acquaintances up to speed with his new goals.\nQuickly, he convinced them to rock with him in a dungeon delve. It was going to be his first time in a dungeon.\nSoon, at the dungeon, the sound of skeleton screams got his heart pumping for some high-octane action, he grabbed a spear and stabbed at the air, marking the start of a joyous occasion.\nAs soon as the skeletons appeared, he ran around, stabbing them one by one, using shields to block their arrows.\nThe skeletons with swords found themselves overwhelmed by the weight of human flesh, since their bones were much more brittle and light in comparison, only making up 14% of the total body weight. But magic helped with their attacks.\nIn the end, Matthew found himself in a fight for his life. But this time, he was happy.\nHe swung a sword he picked up as he ran, passing by several adventurers running in different directions.\nThe skeletons were separated and struggling to keep up.\nMatthew saved his skill for now in case a stronger monster force emerged.\nMeanwhile, the adventurers managed to slash sideways against three skeleton’s legs, making them collapse in an exaggerated manner. This roused a chorus of laughter enough that they wheezed and hugged their stomachs.\nConsequently, Matthew began chuckling, his laugh soon taking on a loud and boisterous form.\nLater, the adventurers cheered as they mowed a group of glowing skeletons over with magic and spells.\nThe skeletons fell one by one.\nMatthew followed along skipping.\nAs soon as they completed the dungeon, Matthew got a quest.\nAdventure Awaits: Skeleton Festivity!\nEmbark on a thrilling quest to spread joy throughout the land by eliminating 25 mischievous skeletons within the next 8 hours. Happy belated 25th birthday!\nRewards Await:\nExperience Points (XP) Boost to elevate your journey to new heights!\nRare Loot Drop Chance Increase, enhancing your chances of discovering treasures beyond imagination!\nGold Coins to enrich your coffers and fund your next grand adventure!\nExclusive Skeleton Slayer Title, earning you recognition as a hero among heroes in the realm!\nJoin the jubilant fray and let the goblin-slaying festivities commence!\nChapter 14 - Detaching From Ingrained Tendencies linkHe stared at the silence, and in the dark, he became like a light.\nHe aimed his spear and stabbed forward, striking the goblin menace.\nHe remembered one of his enemies, Mawkery.\nBut he wondered when the idea of enemies extended to actual violence instead of enemies in a video game.\nNow, he was playing with lives, and he was racking up lives.\nTime was ticking, and his sense of self might be deteriorating.\nBut he was happy.\nBut that could just something he showed.\nHe aimed his weapon.\nHe slashed a skeleton.\nHe tore it apart piece by piece.\nHe developed himself, and the [System] continued to rewarded him.\nThe [System] showed him that he had unused stat points from his past level-ups.\nThis meant that the [System] finally showed him a stat besides [Vitality].\nThis also meant that his levels finally had some use.\nAttack Damage🪓: 60\nAbility Power🔥: 0\nArmor🛡️: 30\nMagic Resistance🚫: 30\nHealth🗿: 600\nUnused stat points: 2770\nMatthew never considered how stats affected human strength because he wasn’t a fighter himself. But he knew that what adventurers did was impressive. And that was what motivated him to discover more about stats and how they impacted human ability. When he finally tested it firsthand, then he could finally observe others and appreciate the power of the [System] in engendering power.\nThe [System] gave him a list showing the value of one unit of each attribute when converted to unused stat points.\nAttack Damage🪓: 35 stat points (SP)\nAbility Power🔥: 20 SP\nArmor🛡️: 20 SP\nMagic Resistance🚫: 18 SP\nHealth🗿: 2.67 SP\nMatthew would remember how the [System] made him.\nAfter asking for clarifications, he learned that [Ability Power] only affected damage and confirmed that Armor and Magic Resistance mitigated [Physical Damage] and [Magic Damage], respectively. This was strange since skills were commonly associated with magic, but many skills dealt only physical damage. Moreover, he discovered that increasing an attribute had to be exact, so he couldn’t increase [Armor] by 1.5 by spending 30 unused stat points.\nSince he was a close-ranged fighter, he thought that maximizing his survivability, especially since he had healing, sounded sensible. Contrastingly, he was able to fend off and beat multiple goblins easily, given that he had [Whirlwind Waltz] now. To counterpoint that, he might face enemies capable of dealing horrendous damage in a short amount of time. In the end, he decided to take a well-rounded approach and dump all his points as equally as he could.\nHe allocated 540 points for each attribute, yielding 15 [Attack Damage], 27 [Ability Power], 27 [Armor], 30 [Magic Resistance], and 202 [Health].\nAfter he was left with 15.66 unused stat points, he dumped the rest into [Health], ending with 5 more [Health]. In conclusion, he still had 2.31 unused stat points that couldn’t be used for now.\nAttack Damage🪓: 75\nAbility Power🔥: 27\nArmor🛡️: 57\nMagic Resistance🚫: 60\nHealth🗿: 807\nUnused stat points: 2.31\nAs for why he opted for a more versatile approach, he didn’t have enough information to make a specialized allocation. Even if he knew that obtaining 2,770 unused stat points was likely rare, it was better to be flexible and hedge his bets since anything could happen—the investor’s approach within the realm of risk management and strategic thinking. He could have considered taking the time to consult his circle before spending his points, but he didn’t want to persist nakedly while the world around him channeled challenges and opportunities all around him. It was better to make systematic decisions instead of throwing blitzkriegs randomly at uncharted land, especially when mountains could likely be in the way.\nIn short, he chose to go for the 90% chance of winning strategy with moderate rewards than the 5% chance with higher reward. In the long term, the former option rewarded much, much more.\nTo counterpoint this argument, improvising and adapting to this current situation was crucial, and even systems would fail if overly reliant on what had worked many times before.\nHowever, this adapting and improvising mainly took place in the actual fighting rather than in the drafting stage. To end with an example, much improvisation, enforced by rudimentary tactics and equipment, led to less coordinated, efficient, and stable amphibious assaults in World War 1 compared to those in World War 2.\nThis back-and-forth occurred in Matthew’s head. He was his best debate partner.\nBut in the end, he grinned widely because he could finally afford to break open the “door.”\nIt was a joke that circled around his second adventurer party. To explain, the “door” referred to a specific faunthorn or humanoid deer, the one that blocked a group of escaping goblins from entering a doorway in a past quest.\nHe laughed.\nHe went to Block \u0026 Bed Tavern where he met some of his inn friends, the ones he befriended throughout his time here during his rest days.\nInside, several men were seated, their gaits relaxed and resting on the backrests and table edges.\nHe passed by them, rounding several corners before stopping in front of an empty table.\nThen, at his left, a woman sidled forward, her expression friendly, her hair flowing, her eyes squinting. She was Lumi.\nSitting down, she said: “Hey, Matthew.”\n“Hey.” Matthew smiled briefly before focusing on sitting down. That smile was for his new stats.\n“They were wondering if you’re the one who bought the skill tablets? Uh, it’s probably not you, of course.”\nMatthew squinted before smiling subtly. “No, no… I… Yeah—I wasn’t the one.”\nLumi glanced outside, tapping her lap. “Okay.”\nAnother one emerged, her footsteps like the swinging of a pendulum, gesturing toward Matthew.\nShe was Elara, who called herself the “Raider,” and she said: “It’s nice to see you again, man.”\nMatthew nodded happily.\nElara, after a short pause, continued: “I haven’t seen you in a while. What have you been doing? I’ve been slaying slimes and started practicing my new skill—” Having checking her left and right, she slashed in front of herself elegantly, curving and flourishing it in a theatrical manner. “I can now slash several slimes and slowly stack the skill’s damage. All I have to do is stay by the beginner level, and I’m solved. Want to see?”\nElara’s body language communicated that she wanted to demonstrate more slashing outside.\nMatthew shook his head. “Let’s eat first.” He removed his hands from his hands and placed them down on the table.\nAfter a brief pause, Elara sat down across from him next to Lumi.\nSeeing the women side by side, Matthew thought about something that rarely preoccupied his mind.\nAs a majority man, Matthew liked women, but he didn’t really feel compelled to fall in love or have sexual relations with them. For the most part, if he did fall in love or have sex, it would be by choice. Though, he did wonder if there was something wrong with him.\nHe didn’t feel romantic and sexual emotions except when he needed to relieve excessive stress. This was why he only felt noticeably attracted to women when he was lying down at night when he was most stressed after working the whole day.\nMoreover, he never found himself attracted to men, so he was still straight.\nThis was his definition of normal, making him furrow his brows at more typical depictions and expressions of love and sexuality when he saw them everywhere.\nIn the end, he didn’t care. More accurately, he didn’t want to care.\nIn the same vein, he also heard someone mention that Marcher died, and his first thought was, “It’s a shame, but it is what it is.”\nReturning to the reunion, the third person who arrived was a man named “Thorne,” greeting Matthew: “Matt, what have you been doing lately? I heard you were getting ahead of yourself. Remember when you came to me crying telling me someone you knew died and that you couldn’t handle goblins at all?”\nMatthew cringed out of embarassment. Even if he was close to them, he had wanted to learn how to be more independent because he was afraid of experiencing loss again.\n“Really?” said Elare, sharing a heartfelt, compassionate frown with Lumi.\n“Yeah,” Matthew said with an evasive tone, his voice trying to fade into the background, tilting his body off to the side.\n“Well, I was hoping to get you to join us for an upcoming mission—”\n“Yeah, we were hoping you’d try out the new tournament items we got!”\nThese three were not adventurers in the typical sense, since they blended into civil life and never interacted with monsters. But they did have shared some characteristics of an adventurer and identified as such.\nWhen Matthew headed to the cafe again, he saw a familiar face, the registrant he met at the concierge.\nIn the meantime, he finally felt rested and looked at his [System] notifications.\n🏆 Quest Completed: Skeleton Festivity!\nCongratulations, valiant adventurer!

Let the Skeleton Festivity continue, as you stand as a beacon of hope and courage for all!\nAt the moment, since the three people in front of him were engaged in a conversation and no one else was bothering him, he slowed down for a moment.\nHe wasn’t here to pour more on his plate. He was here because he wanted to be honest for once in his life.\n“I lost my family,” he said after months of not saying a word about it, taking Thorne’s implied suggestion to share with them. “I lost them only recently. It was hard… I saw my family just three months ago, but now, I feel like a fraud. How have I been coping so well these past few months? I don’t know how I was able to hold it on for so long, y’know? I feel like a fraud… I’m… sorry… I just wanted… I just wanted to be… okay…” Part of what he said was initially performative, but what he didn’t know was that he was being honest. This initial perfomative nature reflected that systematic way of dealing with his problems.\nThe three looked at him for a moment, waiting for him to continue. A few seconds passed, but before they could speak, Matthew said his next words.\n“I lost so much. I lost my life. I lost everything I’ve ever known. I lost the feeling of being… alive, awake. I’m not the same anymore. I… don’t… know. I can’t remember anymore what it was like to…” He trailed off, looking around him, his eyes wet. He shook his head slightly and blinked hard, tilting his head off to the side. He sniffled twice and looked up for a while before wincing briefly.\nLater, after he finished, he took a bath, filled his stomach, and quenched his thirst. At that point, he was back to work face.\nTo summarize his perspective and agency in the world, he saw the world as a giant place where anything could happen, including death, starvation, and anger. His heart grew several times when he discovered that the goblins were people in their own right. However, his hands were also skilled in dismantling (killing) them, so it felt natural for him to obey his commitments, that which the adventurer party who had saved him at the beginning of his journey in this world cultivated. He was like a child groomed for a war, but he had a choice here because he had time to think amid the pressures. He knew that sooner or later, he had to make a decision, and neglecting his commitments and promises would isolate him. If he was isolated, he would need to find a new support structure willing to accomodate his desires for peace. Moreover, the [System] itself enabled his destructive behavior, so he had to resist it as well. But he didn’t know how he could peaceably provide for himself, since adventuring was all he knew. He had more civilian commitments like his employee relations job, and he had been able to walk around the village and achieve the “Kindness” quest the [System] offered him. But he also felt that as time passed, he felt more drawn to the idea of power. Having been part of the adventurers for a long time, they were his family, so even now, he was looking for alternative routes, provided by people like Elara, Thorne, and Lumi. He was hoping to find a compromise that wasn’t total avoidance of adventurer culture but wasn’t complicit either.\nHowever, this assessment was subjective, and his real-life emotions were much more intense. He downplayed how violent he was by refraining from focusing on the detail of bloodshed and the emotional facets of his goblin opponents. This summarization outlined his ideals rather than his actuality.\nJustification and idealism was necessary for him to proceed, which was as all wars followed. It helped him make his brutal decisions and his kind ones. It helped him change the world for the better and for the worse.\nIt was an essential component of his intellectual journey.\nReturning to reality, Matthew knew that he was not perfect, but he had to keep going or die trying.\nHe ran, finding several dogs in the distance. He saw them many times, but he never addressed their existence.\nSo this time, he would look around himself more and see the factors that he had dismissed or had too little energy or understanding to appreciate.\nThe dogs ranged from red, blue, and green in the color of their fur. Besides that, they looked like normal dogs.\nMatthew tried to constrain his efforts, trying to get his [System] to respond to this dogs.\nHowever, the [System] was largely silent, only showing the dogs’ stats with their health and level, supporting his view that it was violent in nature.\nMatthew realized that the [System] no longer wholly served his purposes, so he had to think outside the box and rely on other magical means of empowering himself. If the [System] mandated growth only through violence, he had to find alternatives, so he wasn’t using the hammer for everything not a nail. The world demanded communication and social skills, both of which rested on empathy and a cosmopolitan mindset. And if he lacked this essential skill, he was practically a floating boat in a sea of isolation.\nIn order to accrue power, he had to know how to wield it, which meant retreating, slowing down the pace to scale for late game, and not getting caught instead of just charging at the enemy like a single-minded kid running at a bunch of speeding vehicles.\nAs he looked around, he realized something.\nThe dogs were biting him, turning the skin of his arm blue with frost.\nHe backed off and ran away, having forgotten to be careful of this world at every turn. He remembered again that it was not going to be easy for him to explore this world if he didn’t know the unspoken rules everyone learned while growing up.\nAfter healing himself, he remembered again that not everyone or everything was amenable to reason and might kill even when well-fed or act extremely in response to specific catalysts, those not easily verifiable to a standard, but which were individualized, making models of conversation challenging. These extremities of response could be recognized with the low-functioning patient, wherein communication with the physician and social members was impaired.\nHe noticed that he himself exhibited a pronounced increase in formal thought, potentially a form of distancing from the marked physicality characterized by the dogs.\nHe returned to normal and recognized his awkward positioning, having paused his journey and engaged in other activites that afforded him rest while still accruing a large variety of significant growth, albeit that ont occupied by violence and killing and [System] stats and levels. His recent surge of cultivation was more cerebral and psychological, marking a step in a positive direction away from senseless chaos and action, reducing the risks posed by an impulsive outlook. Indeed, he learned that his stress levels had been much lower since he confessed to Elara and company. If he didn’t do so, it would fester, basking in an emergent manner when future difficulties struck.\nHe orchestrated the recent events and ended them all with a crystal-clear vision of what lay ahead. It wasn’t clairvoyance but a robust system facilitated and exploited to mitigate expected gaps in skill and knowledge by Matthew.\nMatthew collected himself and pressed forward. This time, his strikes would be systematized, even if not necessarily evidence-backed, considering the apparent lack of scientific support he observed during the last 3 months.\nHe was confident that learning the adventurers’ fighting skills would not contribute to his success as much as training his ability to discern tactically, strategically, and influentially at this moment. However, if he covered off his current commitments and refrained from taking too many new ones, then he could adopt a more well-rounded learning cycle not entirely dominated by stress, confusion, and adventurer fighting. This way, he could spread his energy “points” around activities such as physical and combat training, [System] skill advancement, intelligence gathering in the facets of culture, structure, and individuals, and self-care in a more proactive way rather than a mere subservience to the adventurer flow.\nThis was his goal, and he would climb recklessly if he had to. Of course, this “recklessness” could be calculated and take the form of determination, with the theme of recklessness only being a dramatic but motivational force.\nHe would stun-lock anyone who would get in his way.\nBut oh how delightful would it be if he could just control these little…!\nHe took deep breaths to calm himself, finding himself in front of three members of his first adventurer party: Suneater “Brackern” Herculeanridder, Redspiller “Brandon” Warmaker, and Doomsinger “Michel” Mighttaker. He hadn’t prepared to meet them, but they were here for him at the hunting grounds where the late golem maker had told him to go.\nHe smiled, suppressing a brief smirk, then adopting an analytical demeanor.\nHe breathed audibly, lumbering toward them.\nAs if he predicted it, the [System] gave him a new quest:\nA piano melody started playing in Matthew’s head. It came from the [System].\nQuest: Adventurer Ambush\nObjective: Assassinate three skilled adventurers within the next 24 hours.\nReward:\nSkill Mastery Enhancement\nAccess to Restricted Guild Resources\nValuable Artifacts\nPrestigious Assassin’s Title\nMatthew wondered what the purpose of the [System] was, as the cheery voices of the three adventurers began to resound, reminding him of the people he had known back on Earth, the thousands of experiences he had, and the many memories pervading that time of his life. Now, he was here, castrated by a power above him and beyond his comprehension—the [System]. In response to loss, a fuel of flame and rage began in his heart.\nHe wondered if the violence of the [System] was inevitable, or if that was the quest most adventurers soon got.\nInstead of relying on his baser instincts of combat, he used his voice: “Guys, something’s wrong with my [System]. It’s telling me to attack you guys. It’s a quest. What should I do?”\nSuneater, Redspiller, and Doomsinger nodded, and even if Sophia and Deathbringer weren’t here, they explained that the [System] was random and that quests like these could be ignored. They said that it was only a random suggestion from the [System] and not an actual pattern. According to them, it was also not inherently violent.\nMatthew remembered the “Kindness” quest and realized that he might have been seeing a pattern that wasn’t actually there. That the [System] was violent was a conclusion he had surmised due to his lack of experience and tender circumstances.\nShifting to the physical level, the trembles of footsteps emerged, sounding an alarm in their heads. From the distance, hundreds of sprinters ran through the forest, utilizing various spells to speed themselves up.\nThis was the second facet of this city that Matthew had yet to engage in—civil life with magic—the first being adventurers.\nThe sprinters came in running, so Matthew observed, letting in the light of understanding that spoke of people beyond his own profession and circumstances,\nThose sprinters near Matthew emerged as unique individuals, each embodying various characters and wearing clothes of unique combinations and various colors.\nHe tried to let them into his mind, but he could only express his awe.\nThe light sky bounced across a wave of generations spanning the world, hundreds of plants growing and dying everyday, thousands of people crafting their destinies with a rod-like magical quill, their souls brimming with agency and flavor. Each person existed within their own world.\nMatthew was just one of them, and his perception of his power would shift as he learned about others’ perspectives.\nHe exploded with a ray of glory, his hand a mighty fist that established greatness upon the earth. But so were that of the people around him, brimming with agency and flavor. They graciously threaded and linked connections and ideas together, forming concrete structures that maintained themselves measuredly. The sky appreciated their glory and watched them glide.\nMatthew found himself trying to leaf through all the pages in their life, but finding himself blocked by the limitations of his single mind.\nHis reality and his casualness with violence was not shared by those around him.\nHis sole peers in this were the adventurers.\nWith time, the sprinter event inculcated the recognition of individuals and their various circles and social structures into him.\nHe mastered the patience to accept the emotions encircling this information, condensing it into fruition.\nChapter 15 - The Puppeteer’s Gambit linkBut for some reason, despite the sprinter event being a reflection of a more active community, it also reflected the wealthier part of the community. What used to be a battleground between an adventurer coalition and goblins became an area where those wealthy enough to afford the grounds or knew someone who did enjoyed themselves. It was treated similar to a noble’s hunting land, as several cave networks, dungeons, and various underground chambers provided entertainment for wealthier adventurers seeking novelty and enjoyment in a controlled space. Even adventurers were separated into broad categories of high, mid, and low income, each easily identified by their abodes and communities. Interestingly, it was also the higher-income adventurers that held the responsibility of fighting for adventurer rights. So even if mobility between classes could be considered easier in certain metrics such as individual ability, individual ability didn’t necessarily lead to substantial outcomes.\nAll of this information about the sprinters and their implications he gleaned from the adventurers themselves with support from various sources. Even throughout his emotional “charades,” he still spent a fortune into his own personal development, having perfected the approval of Sophia and Deathbringer in his advance toward enchanted armor and weapons. This was more than just asking others for help. This was delegation and establishing support structures through which he could reach out in case anything outside of his expectations arose. It was solidifying his place in the world.\nIn line with this analytical mood, even now, Matthew addressed several issues by entreating the adventurers for information, having ridden himself of the illusion of distance between them. His thoughts were spiraling robotically, assembling new means of collating knowledge. If he could essentialize his current state by streamlining stray issues into a coherent melting pot, then he would become God Almighty in a metaphorical manner.\nOne of those issues included the concern about [System] titles and how they contributed to his reputation. If their effectiveness was fraudulent, then he would have to concretize them into observable details. This meant that he would approach people and see how they responded to him. This would require a long study with a sample size of at least a hundred participants.\nThis was his college degree approach.\nExclusive Goblin Slayer Title: With your outstanding performance, you’ve earned the prestigious title of “Goblin Slayer.” Display it proudly, as it symbolizes your expertise in eradicating these menacing creatures.\nExclusive Skeleton Slayer Title: With your exceptional performance, you’ve rightfully earned the prestigious title of “Skeleton Slayer.” Display it proudly, for it signifies your unmatched valor and heroism in the realm\nIt wouldn’t necessarily be considered rigorous since Matthew was doing this without scientific support structure and doing this in a fantasy medieval magical world. Additionally, it was challenging to ensure the reproducibility of results—a potential advent of replication crisis. Still, this study was helpful in promoting a systematic approach that could lead to scientific progress. In particular, the benefits of this approach could be outlined by four key advantages. One, through the formulation of hypotheses, planning of observations, and the analysis of data, this was an example of critical thinking, which lay the groundwork for scientific inquiry. Two, while limited in scope and generalizability, this was a starting point for future research into the mechanics of the [System]. Three, this contributed to an exploration of methodologies within the [System] framework, which could inspire adventurers to work out new meta (most effective tactics available) trends. Four, this encouraged collaboration and discussion, prime preludes to research question refinement and the sharing of insights and discoveries. In the end, he was creating a glorious empire of enlightenment.\nSubsequent to this study, he wanted also to find evidence for the supposed rare loot drop chance since the [System] didn’t proactively notify him of it while he fought.\nRare Loot Drop Chance Increase: Your heroic deeds have attracted the favor of fortune. Your chances of discovering rare and priceless loot have now risen to extraordinary levels.\nAs for why Matthew could only spend so much effort into analyzing everything around him, his emotions gave him little time to breathe; however, they were not anything, as shown by his recent advancements into and through his current assets.\nThis was proactivity.\nAfter this, he retreated home and combatted sleep deprivation, having spent himself up. If he didn’t sleep, he would struggle under the associated negative effects. His sleepiness made his analytical mindset pronounced, albeit concomitant with the extreme assertions of emotion and loneliness besieging his mind.\nHe had to mitigate their effects on him by taking deep breaths and striking back against the assertions with positivity—the fallible critter could only hug this tool late at night when the bed bugs bit.\nIn the end, when he fell asleep, his body was vulnerable, bugs roaming at the horizon.\nThe next day, the various locations of the city became much clearer to him; however, it was still murky to him. This referred to how well he could navigate the town by memory alone and how well he could understand the importance and functions of each location via the individuals, details, and various events that had taken place, took place there regularly, or would take place there.\nEven now, he still needed to breathe to keep his brain from frying under pressure. Each individual in the city presented opportunities beyond his wildest imaginations, so even with his commitments right now, he wanted to grab more to gain the benefits of the next stage of network expansion, his left hand stretching out.\nHe had benefitted enough from his fellow adventurers, so he had to find new angles in which to approach them. Relying on the same old traditions that he had established throughout the course of the last three months would be disastrous. So his next step would be strengthing how responsive his current network of friends were, each with their varying dispositions, expectations, and debts toward him. He had to ascertain them all and keep his mind sharp, or else he might cut himself with how strictly linear and pointy his relations were becoming. In other words, the more “sensible” or linear his relations were, the more disastrous it was. As for the reason of this, everyone grew dynamically and the amount and ways each one could contribute ever-shifted. If he started to become complacent and unimaginative with the way he treated them, he would miss opportunities and slow down his growth. Openness to new technologies could be compared to this.\nIn order to do this, one method would be to mish-mash his acquaintances together by having them meet up. A second method would involve collaborating with those whom he never had alone time with.\nMoreover, he could also begin studying the infrastructure and the patterns they took. He already had a strong understanding of a particular front; however, he also wanted to continue developing downhill toward the lower and usually poorer areas of the town where tropical flooding was most ruinous.\nSince he lived in the mid-level areas of the town where the main road intersected both with the proliferating peasant markets and the selective wealthy bastions, he could easily identify where people most spent their time. However, it was being able to synthesize the patterns of traffic and how well the infrastructure served it, highlighting its faults and weaknesses and zeroing in on its strengths, that was crucial to his aims. His goal was to see if how he could influence the town, starting from an urban terrain analysis.\nThis would require years of work in order for him to achieve alone without some form of intelligence magic or the like.\nSo he recalled several individuals who might aid him in understanding the city, particularly older people who had seen the evolution of the city. He remembered the older man who suggested that he let a tree be. This suggestion was strange, but it was memorable. As for other details, he lost count of the numerous adventurers he had seen in the guild throughout his time here. He might remember some regulars’ faces, but the limits of his memory were only up to people like Tamer and Rodney, whom he had only met relatively recently. He noticed that what he remembered the most were people he met at the beginning of his time here in this world and those he met recently. He presumed that the stress and burnout during the middle part of his journey was the cause.\nSo he visited the older man.\nThen, his urges flared up because for some reason, as soon as he saw the older man, he knew that this man was powerful. It was not instinctive. It was not clairvoyance. It was because it was only natural now to assume that anyone in this world hid something beyond his means and understanding. He would give them the benefit of the doubt by assuming they could change his world.\nMeanwhile, the older man was sitting down at a small, standalone cafeteria, having eaten good food to match his mood. He didn’t know how long he had, but this was an excellent moment for respite away from his past memories. They were all too much, and even if he had so many good, he also had so many bad. In fact, it was the good memories that hurt him the most. The bad ones he had moved away from, but he never got closure for so many things. He was stuck to see progress and good things go unfulfilled and unresolved. He gritted his teeth, seeking the power to change his circumstances. If he could only have the power to destroy this world, then maybe he could have the power to save it—to improve it, to give it life, and to see life flourish with understanding. But he could bite his lips with resignment and let go, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t pretend for too long. Maybe, he could pretend long enough for him to reach his climax and his end of life. But this would be anti-climactic for him. He would just be a pretending little lost cause, having spent so much and gained so little to match. He had to do something for once in his life, even if he had done so much already. It was a constant desire, the desire for change.\nOthers saw him as this fulfilled older man who had lived a perfect life. But he was still the boy who couldn’t save his friends. He was still the boy who couldn’t pay back the good done to him. He was still the boy who had improved and grown so much. And he was grateful and proud of that. But he couldn’t just sit still while the young fought and died. He couldn’t sit still while the young suffered under the responsibilties expected from them. He couldn’t just watch. He had to do something.\nIn the distance, he noticed a familiar young man approaching him with eyes flaring with intent.\nWhen the young man halted several meters away, the older man kept his face taut with seriousness, locking eyes for several seconds, before he loosened up and smiled. “You have grown, haven’t you?” he said enigmatically, pouring a cup of water and ordering a bowl of noodles for him.\nThe young man, wearing a purple tunic and a yellow surcoat and foreign trousers, glasses, and strangely shaped sandals. His face was sculpted with an oblong-shaped head that could look round depending on hair and smile; curly hair styled as straight hair; charming, large round downturned eyes; delightfully thick eyebrows; a button nose; and full lips. He looked both adorable and intimidating depending on how he carried himself.\nBut this was only his appearance.\nEarlier, the young man, Matthew Cruz, was thinking of heading to the bazaar where the adventurers he knew worked. He was hoping to talk to their younger siblings to see what they had to say about the world. Moving forward, this would fill him up with essential information belonging to a usually neglected facet of the world, as most adults forgot their desires, ideas, and perspective as a child, having grown past them to fulfill their adult responsibilities.\nBut he decided to head to the older man for now.\nNow that he was here, he wanted to see what the older man had in mind.\nThe older man said, imitating a young man’s way of talking: “I forgot what it was like on your side of things, since we’ve only known each other that time.”\nMatthew grinned sheepishly, saying: “Yeah, I do remember… I was in a hurry because… I had a lot of things… on my plate that… time.” He inhaled deeply through his nose and looked around, gazing at the traffic of the city, imaginatively seeing the patterns and dynamics characterized by various groups of passersby. He had to overlook each individual because they were too numerous. But he could at least get a stronger assessment of the city life compared to when he first came here to this city.\nHis tone shifted to that of secrecy. “Tellervo,” he said. “Have you heard of the goblin raids already making their way through various hobbit towns? The battle is already beginning, and the humans are already casting their lots.”\n“Humans?”\nThe older man bewitched him, casting a spell that terminated any intellectual thought occuring in Matthew’s brain.\nMatthew stopped thinking and slowly leaned back. Since his chair was only a stool, he fell backward, but the older man caught him with both arms by his clothes.\nThe city couldn’t help him because the older man was too powerful for his spells to be noticed or heard.\nThe next day, the older man brought him to a cliff, exhausted from the journey he took.\n“What you will do now is wake up!” His declaration magically caused Matthew to open his eyes and abruptly stand up, having felt an intense urge to do so.\nNow that he was awake, he looked at the older man, fear becoming more obvious and vivid as the seconds came in. “What the hell are you doing?”\nThe older man stared at him for a while, still regaining his composure from the exhaustion.\nAfter several minutes, Matthew was terrified, having frozen in place, his limbs lingering in an awkward position. Moreover, the older man began marching down the mountain, and he was quick, sprinting and jumping across the smoothest path down. As soon as he reached the bottom, he began creating a building by summoning blocks of construction materials out of thin air, magically placing them down in perfect alignment.\nAs soon as he was done an hour later, he created a tavern.\nMatthew had escaped during that time.\nAs soon as he returned home, he sat down at a bazaar.\nOne of the adventurers, Suneater “Brackern”, approached him, seeing his distraught face that looked composed just a moment ago.\n“What’s wrong, Matthew!” His voice was strong like a piercing glare, but it was smooth like a hug from a friend. He was a friend.\nMatthew remembered playing games back on Earth where players did things that defied logic and surprised their enemies to their advantage. He also realized that if he met this world’s equivalent to one of these players at any stage of their journey, they would be very dangerous, unpredictable individuals.\nHe realized that the older man was one of them. Now that he thought about it, the golem maker was probably one of them as well. Maybe, even the disgusting man too.\nHe needed to kill other unique special people who had found a way to become powerful through finding hidden abilities, secret classes, clairvoyant knowledge, divine blessings, and powerful artifacts, among others. He also had to be careful of fellow people who travelled here from Earth because some of them might be tenacious psychopathic remorseless murderers. Incidentally, psychopaths still felt anger, frustration, and pleasure, but even with that, they were likely bad at socializing and maintaining long-term connections since empathy and trust were crucial facets of that.\nAnyway, Matthew ultimately had to make a choice, having many options now that things were better.\nRecognizing that entering a cave by himself or in insufficient numbers meant certain failure and potentially death, he mobilized his fellow adventurers.\nThe older man was the straw that broke the camel’s back.\nHe would control this world.\nHe visited three controlled dungeon steps where he hypothesized about the dynamics of goblin behavior, proposing a plan to study them.\nThis would be a study that drew from full-day focal follows of adult female blue goblins in three study groups for each dungeon steps; phenological data from the goblin group home ranges; and insect abundance data via malaise trap and sweep net methods; among others. To end, these follows would last 4 to 5 months, around 140 days.\nFor context, the term “blue” in their names referred to their bluish-green skin.\nAfter consulting with adventurer experts during planning, he found out that various species and subspecies of goblin could be recognized. Furthermore, he found out their sizes and weights. Typical sizes ranged from 50 to 65 centimeters in length, with females weighing a little over 6 kilos and males up to 10 kilos.\nInformation like these would soon be valuable in methodologies moving forward, as many skills relied on this. Of course, many adventurers could instinctively make good decisions, but having mathematical and scientific confirmation made that much more fool-proof since even the best made bad improvisations frequently enough to rouse an evidence-backed need.\nIn the end, Matthew returned home. He wanted to ground himself again after becoming emotional. Significantly, his emotions were well-managed so as to be almost invisible even in his decision-making. But he still needed to unwind.\nSo he walked around the city, his heart beating amid the chaos tearing through the fabric of daylight. Before this, Peace was expected to create satisfying conclusions. But that was over. In other words, the chaos persisted and broke through the now ephemeral moments of goodness represented by light, which had been tasked with devastating the measly ruination proposed by the confusion and lack of resolution promoted by the night. To sum, Matthew walked despite the victory of Chaos.\nWith this, his heart regained flesh and blood, and his mind returned to sharpness. Now, he summarized.\nDuring his appreciation of the cityscape, after reviewing his memories, he came to several conclusions: that his humanity had thus been defined, that he was not special, and that he could die any time.\nChapter 16 - A World Remade: Matthew’s Reckoning linkMatthew stared at the landscape, his heart beating thunderously.\nHe giggled before erupting in a triumphant guffaw.\nHe was angelic in all its flavors, great in all its words, and heavenly in all its mania.\nHe was euphoric, and his emotions lay bare by the wayside.\nHe fell by the wayside.\nDeep existential horror enveloped him.\nThe beating of a drum. The sounds of god tearing through his chest. The ethereal becoming present in his mind. He was lovely and thirsty for a drink. Mama. Papa. This now was his reckoning. He was freedom in all its glory and tearable in all its fabric. He could not comprehend his own validity. So he invalidated himself by saying: “Not today, Mama, not today is today. Tomorrow is a different day when it should have been on Earth, not here. Not here. I am not the me that I am. I am a different me, transposed away from myself.”\nHe was lonesome and tired.\nThe night sky broke him up into tiny pieces, and his heart was too much to bear. So he begged to break it and tear it apart like it knew nothing.\nHe was not…\nThroughout the course of a week, Matthew reassessed his resources and called up an assortment of adventurers to the forefront, having earned enough money to placate them. Moreover, he invited tension between them by offering competitive benefits via the announcement of flexible yet grandiose objectives and rewards. This made it easier for them to organize under him: people loved friends, but what they loved most were compatriots.\nHis objectives for them involved hunting down several goblin troops and hideouts. Naturally, the help of warders were enlisted and organized for this sake.\nMany people rallied under Matthew, and soon enough, he declared his intention of participating in a broader conflict. This was his plot and scheme that he had fought to devise with tooth and nail.\nMightily, he stood tall, standing watch. All of the aforementioned events were the visible aspects of his operation. The invisible ones he dispersed resources to nourish and leaders to spearhead would continue to hum with vigor, red in tooth and claw.\nWhere he failed, he walked around with newfound purpose. This was his reckoning.\nMeanwhile, Jishu, a young man, watched the adventurer named “Matthew” in the distance.\nMatthew’s form was high and glorious. Each step he made declared his new position of power. He was better than Jishu was.\nJishu walked up to the man, offering his services as a saint.\nMatthew asked him what a saint could do.\nThe young man assumed that Matthew was testing him.\nFrom a different angle, two boys the age of 12 and 13 accompanied their paraplegic friend to see the city, and when they saw Matthew’s company all wearing a simple purple attire, they sprouted to high voices.\n“What is that?” said the 12-year-old boy named “Jack,” running up and down a flight of steps.\n“That looks like a guy wearing paint,” said the 13-year-old boy, Levi, bending down and leaning most of his body weight against a stone corner, his palms fronting the lean. “Is that paint on his face?”\n“No, I think that’s just his skin color,” said the friend of the two, stretching his arm with a pinched expression. Earlier, he offered to carry the other two boys’ personal crates that they used as bags.\n“Oh, where is he from?” said Jack, jumping up and down, tripping and catching himself, getting a brow raise from Levi.\n“I don’t know,” said Levi, giving a thumbs up to Jack. “But he looks pretty foreign.”\n“Really?”\n“Yeah.”\nIn a different scene, various adventurers walked around the city, having done their daily routine activities and were now completing their reports for the month to send to middle management.\nFor context, the tall registrant from whom Matthew had received skill-related help, Rodney, was part of a division laterally related to the division that accepted these reports within the adventurer guild: Rodney’s division regularly supplied them with information.\nThis whole system directly benefitted from Matthew’s engagement with the community. Matthew’s intervention was less a product and more so an act of an entrepreneur.\nMatthew would never collapse.\nEven if he felt emotional at times, no one could stop him.\nWith time, he came into battles, his expression that of pity.\n“I am sorry.” He was sorry.\nBut he had to.\nHe stabbed goblins left and right, his arms creating tornado-like waves of impact.\nHe sundered several goblin limbs, wishing that he could continue this expression of his love. He loved this world now. He had to. He was forced to.\nHe sliced several goblins in the face, with the help of his comrades.\nHis friends fought, and he raged with a pitiable expression. His heart surged as his weapons reached their targets.\nHe slashed and pretended to feel weak, but his heart bursted with fiery anger. His movements fluidly brought forth the goblins’ vulnerabilities, removing from them the most brute of their armor.\nHe chopped them down, making their names unutterable anymore.\nHe could only become himself.\nHe loosened his fists, only to kill more along his path. This smoothness and elegance brought forth the greatest violence, for when anger was no longer a controlling force but support, he could do what he would.\nHe raised his sword by the side, standing with his legs bent and his limbs hovering around his form. His eyes, full of compassion, contrasted the grin that robbed his mouth of it.\nHe shook, trembling to success. Because each movement of his arms delivered death.\nHe grabbed a spear and threw it, failing to smash through the goblin shield formation. As soon as he failed, the goblins, hungry for a leader-looking figure, tore through the air tunefully.\nBut with enough forces having punitively regrouped by the flanks, Matthew was able to rain down fire and brutal metal upon their eyes and forms.\nThe goblins died by the tens.\nSoon, Matthew would kill hundreds.\nIn the end, Matthew had finally finished three months, and today marked a fresh start into his life with the onset of the third [System] quest.\nQuest: Bridge of Knowledge\nObjective: Establish and run a school aimed at teaching basic literacy, math, survival skills, and fostering understanding between goblin and human children within the next six months.\nTasks:\nSecure a suitable location for the school that is accessible to both goblin and human communities.\nRecruit qualified teachers proficient in both goblin and human languages, as well as experienced in teaching basic literacy, math, and survival skills.\nDevelop a curriculum that incorporates cultural sensitivity training, empathy-building exercises, and collaborative learning activities tailored to both goblin and human children.\nObtain necessary resources such as textbooks, writing materials, educational tools, and facilities for practical survival skill training.\nReach out to local goblin and human communities to encourage enrollment of children in the school and promote inter-species cooperation and understanding.\nOversee the day-to-day operations of the school, ensuring a safe and inclusive learning environment for all students.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of the program through regular assessments and feedback from students, teachers, and community members.\nReward:\nSatisfaction of fostering harmony and understanding between goblin and human communities.\nRecognition as a peacemaker and educator in both goblin and human societies.\nOpportunity to witness the positive impact of education on bridging cultural divides and promoting cooperation.\nPotential for future collaborations and partnerships aimed at furthering inter-species understanding and cooperation.\n“Who made this!” Matthew’s tone was furious.\nThe [System] stared at him, appearing in a tangible form as a young boy with straight but swirly black hair with brown highlights, wearing a white tuxedo-looking jacket with long, cuffed sleeves over a white suit and black pants. The outfit was full cotton except for the nylon pants.\n“I care about the wholesome of this world,” he said.\nKnowing it was the [System], Matthew bit back his interrupting complaints and took a slow breath. “What’s going on?”\n“I am here to adjust you along the right path since you’ve been in over your head lately. It would be great to see you survive the next coming days. There’s been a goblin uprising in one human city, and though bloodless, their military coup isn’t the final straw. They’re going to coronate a leader intent on campaigning across the entire region.”\n“I know about this. It’s Mawkery, isn’t it?”\nBefore the [System] could say yes, Matthew continued: “But he’s a bad leader. I saw him fail his attack against us. What’s he up to now? How the hell did no one stop him?”\n“He won.”\n“It doesn’t make sense. No one’s making it to the press or any kind of whatever without getting stopped by equally powerful… and ambitious people. That’s the rules!”\n“What rules? Who decides whether someone lives or dies, wins or loses, and becomes king or stays a pauper?”\n“Who? Well, logic of course. This is not sound whatsoever!”\n“This world hasn’t been sound for a while now, Matthew. If you’ve been watching and listening the whole time, why can’t you accept that magic in this world is infallible in its chaos. It never leaves any rock unopened, especially those deemed to be impossible.”\nMatthew stared for a while, holding onto his composure before he let off steam. “Fuck…!”\nHe hadn’t been thinking for a while. No, he had, but he could only assess everything so much. What did he work so hard for anyway? He was stuck to this land, and someone else got to power before him. That wasn’t a logical train of thought. What did power have to do anything? What did being stuck have to do with anything?\nIn the end, although sensible in some manners, his ideals and goals stood far from objectivity. They all rested upon his own rationale.\nWhen he saw that the [System] was not mad or disturbed, Matthew revealed his emotions: “Why now of all times? Is this a joke? Is my life a fucking joke? What am I? The entertainer? Was this you all along? I’m not mad… I’m just disappointed… No, I’m frustrated, and that… makes… me… a little bit… a tiny bit…\n“What’s happening?”\n“You have little time.”\n“No, what’s happening! I don’t care. No, I care, but I don’t want to care—what’s happening right now?”\n“We’ve been through this. The goblins are coming. Mawkery and everyone.”\n“I just don’t get it. Isn’t it crazy that that old man was some fucking weirdo who—I don’t know!—build weird shit? He was building a fucking building! I saw it! How did he do it! How…!? Tell me! Am I lying… Am I lying to my own…” He lost his train of thought, having expressed himself too much to his own tastes.\nThe [System] remained impregnable in composure. “Do you need a friend?”\n“I need a friend, yes. I need someone to tell me that I’m fine.”\nHe suddenly remembered the younger siblings of the adventurers he knew, but he shrugged off that thought with the rest of his flashing thoughts.\nHe said: “Am I going to sit down here… and pretend… that this isn’t stupid or insane? Am I just going to accept things? You think… after trying so hard and improving so much. You think that I’m just going to say, ‘Oh, right, you’re so nice and cool and beautiful, awesome, wow!’ You really think that? I…” He progressed to laughter. “It’s funny. It really is. You claimed me. You turned me into your fucking swine. I am absolutely… ‘combustled’ or something…” He kept laughing, though growing quieter as time passed.\nHe was left in a frown, looking down, sitting with his elbows resting against his neatly tucked legs. “Am I a fraud? Has all my successes been fake this whole time? Who am I? How did I get here? If anyone heard me cry and complain, they wouldn’t think of me as anything at all. They would say, ‘There’s just no fucking way… that guy did anything with his… with everything.’”\nThe rain poured in droves, and he was left to watch the sky again as always.\nHe could compartmentalize himself into his successful heroic side and his fragile child self. How effective!\nTurning to the [System], he smiled sincerely. “Thank you… fucking… man.”\nThe [System] said with a spring of enthusiasm in his voice: “You are welcome!”\nFor a moment after that, it was heavenly quiet.\nWhen Matthew realized the possible misinterpretation of his words, he laughed genuinely, although weakly.\nThe [System] said: “You know… I haven’t been completely transparent.”\n“You think?”\n“I haven’t been transparent at all. There?”\nMatthew sighed.\nThe [System] continued: “First of all, you can call particular me, ‘Godsunderer.’ I’m a warrior from one thousand years ago, and I have been quested to provide quests to adventurers and other people like you.”\n“Seriously? What the hell does that even mean? How does it work? Aren’t you supposed to be like a force of the universe?”\n“I could be, but I’m not. This particular me that is.”\n“You mean the you that’s here now with me?”\n“Yes. So, if you want to know about the [System], the broader one, not just particular me, I’ll tell you. So please be patient as I explain.”\n“Why didn’t you do that before?”\n“I didn’t have to. Now, I have to, but I don’t want to. So I’m going to explain it to you, whether I like or not.”\n“Okay… Please and thank you.”\n“As a reward for your efforts and struggle, let me explain how you came here from Earth. You came from Earth through a pod, which is not a flying space boat but more like a force.”\n“A force?”\n“Yes, the [System] is powerful beyond measure, so see it as a god if you want to. But it has never acted on its own.”\n“Are you sure about that? It should have a soul, given that it tells me what to do.”\n“No, it’s governed by the collection of everything. Everything impacts it.”\n“What?\n“It doesn’t have free will and a soul because it merely expresses data.”\n“Huh. Wait a minute. Humans express data as well. How is that different?”\n“You have a body and a brain. The [System] is merely a mirror that mirrors back what it thinks should happen, and that is also somewhat random.”\n“So you are not real?”\n“I am. I’m just not human or have a soul.”\n“That doesn’t make sense, but okay. Philosophy this that. What’s next?”\n“The reason you were chosen was out of chance, and many came before you. Beware of them.”\n“What…”\n“As for where you were transported in this world, that was also random.”\n“Why here on this planet?”\n“Chance.”\n“Why not on Jupiter or Mars?”\n“Chance.”\n“So what happened to those who went to Jupiter and Mars then?”\n“No one did.”\n“That doesn’t make sense. There must be a reason for why I and others were sent here. If no one came to Jupiter and Mars, then why here? Why not in all billions of planets that don’t have life?”\n“Chance.”\n“Are you saying that it’s out of chance that this planet was selected to receive most of the transported people?”\n“Yes.”\n“You really aren’t helping. Is that supposed to be? Are you supposed to be objective?”\n“Yes, but I don’t have to be entirely ‘objective’. I can say the information however I want. If it takes 3 years for me to explain something that could have been explained in 3 days, then so be it.”\n“Seriously? Is there a time limit…”\nThe [System] just said yes and didn’t explain how long and why.\nEventually, he said, “I will explain skills and how you got your high amount of levels.”\n“Thank god.”\n“Before that, your current skill [Whirlwind Waltz] is too strong, so we have decided to nerf it.”\nWhirlwind Waltz (Level 1)\nCost: 100 Mana\nCooldown: 8 hours\nCast Time: Instant -\u003e 0.5\nEffect Radius: 250\nActive: The user gracefully dances, channeling for 0.5 seconds, colors flashing around them. After the channel, they create a whirlwind of energy around them that lasts for 4 seconds. Enemies within the whirlwind are lifted off the ground, unable to move or attack for 1.5 seconds. After the whirlwind dissipates, affected enemies are slowed by 30% for 2 seconds.\nDuration: 4 seconds\nImmobilization Duration: 1.5 seconds\nSlow Duration: 2 seconds\nThis was so blatant that Matthew couldn’t even speak out of confusion.\n“Huh…”\nThe [System] continued: “Skills are things you use to dish out damage at your enemy, heal friends, and move faster, among other things. The reason you got levels was because the gods recognized you.”\n“Recognized me how?”\n“They recognized you and felt that you existed.”\n“Okay…?”\n“That’s already a massive achievement.”\n“So being recognized as something that exists is a massive achievement. Okay…”\n“Now, as for why your levels didn’t amount to anything, I forgot.”\n“‘I forgot’?”\n“I forgot to send you the coordinates where you will be able to use your levels. Your situation is unique you see, and I also forgot to make sure that your [System] was working the first time.”\n“That’s why it was broken?”\n“That’s why it was broken.”\n“It wasn’t because I was emotional and feeling the drive during that time?”\n“Yes.”\n“That’s insane… So why did I succeed until now? Wasn’t that due to the [System]?”\n“Partly. But you are the one who carried yourself here. Don’t blame anyone but yourself.”\n“That’s a weird way of phrasing it.” For some reason, that was validating.\n“I also should tell you about the coordinates to your new anvil. It’s where you get to spend your levels and distribute your points.”\n“I already did? Why are you saying this?”\n“I forgot…”\nAfter pondering for a while, Matthew slowly said: “I did so much, and I made my own slice of pie in this world, having gone through a lot. It’s not perfect, but I’m not leaving it. Where else can I go? [System], you’re helping me a little, but right now, I would appreciate it if you gave me some space. I need to be alone right now.”\nChapter 17 - An Unexpected Conversation linkAfter his failure to get anything useful from the [System] besides the fact that he now had a direct line to the [System], he returned to work.\nWhen he said he wanted to be alone, he meant it. He wasn’t going to meet anyone he knew for now, even if it was Tamer, Sophia, Deathbringer, Michel, Ada, Kairo, Echo, Ella, Nova, Marcher, Rodney, King Aethelred III, Mawkery, Brandon, Brackern, Marsh Cranberry, Desmond Leroy, the six adventurers, Thorne, Elara, and Lumi, among tens of others.\nHe needed to get away from the noise, but that was also because he had paperwork to fill in. It was a compilation of all the information he gained from experts, adventurers, and scribes. He was compiling it for himself, as he had begun keeping a commonplace book.\nHe couldn’t have the scribes do it due to cost contraints. It wasn’t as if he had a functioning corporation dedicated to his goals and objectives. He had to compromise all the time just to get his goals and objectives partially finished. He never got a full completion, as most joint projects and missions often required much of his time for the benefit of the majority, which meant that it would take time and trust for everyone to cooperate and benefit effectively. He was not the center of the universe, and so he patterned his ends toward sustainability and cooperation, even if it meant engaging in activities that only contributed to trust and not to his own targets.\nIn the long run, this would be better for him, but it wasn’t going to be satisfying.\nHe was pretty much holding onto threads that many other people could interact with at any time. If he so much as thought he could grasp all the threads, he would be pulling peoples’ hairs in the process. They all had to share responsibilities and tasks for one common goal.\nWhat this looked like was that he no longer attended adventurer parties as an independent but as part of the adventurer guild cooperative.\nBut he wondered. Why did he have to sit down here and play with these fools? “They belonged to me! Me alone!”\nHis thoughts sometimes sounded irrational, but that was because he was still sorting himself.\nHe returned to analysis and incorporated his past strategic terrain assessment of the city with respect to a particular front, among other previous events. The quests were instrumental in casting a numerous highlights across a map where he had strong memory. On the map, he traced several overall lines that exposed the distribution of importance between isolated prior experiences, tying them all up in a strong ribbon.\nHowever, even with knowledge, the only way it would be useful was by spreading the various roles needed to undertake any operation requiring it. But the issue was costs and profitability.\nLooking outside, he had an idea.\nHe saw several adventurers near the large fence wall in front of the city gates.\nPassing by several stalls and groups of civilians, he felt pretty isolated.\nWhen he reached the gates, he spotted two beggars at the side and a group of adventurers discussing in front of the fence wall. This place looked closed off for wagons and such, so it might have been a gathering point before leaving and entering.\nThis was a new place, and his fellow adventurers didn’t usually pass here with him.\nHe approached the adventurers.\nHe said, “What is beyond this fence?”\n“Several dungeons off to the side,” said a tall guy among them. “You can check the board for more.” He pointed to a board hanging outside the city gate above the two beggars.\nSeeing that the adventurers were eager to resume their discussion, he thanked them and left, walking up to the board. “What is this? Why is it outside?”\nThe two beggars looked at him and something behind him before saying, “Sir, there’s a wagon.”\nMatthew moved out of the way of a passing wagon that stopped moments later.\nTwo children hopped off the hay bale on the wagon, walking up to the front where their bearded father pointed at the forest beyond the fences. “Wanna go now?” said the father. “We can wait.”\nMatthew returned his focus to the board where he saw several quests written in ink.\n“Rabbit needed.”\n“Dead help.”\n“Soldier at least, save dog.”\nThe writing was very simple and enough to convey the general idea.\nBefore he felt that they were so simple so as to forget to provide a location, he realized that upon touching the papers where the quests were written, he magically knew the direction he had to go to.\nMatthew widened his eyes, realizing that this was probably what adventurer team leaders experienced since they were often the ones who had to pick quests. It was his first time doing a quest alone after all.\nHe took the “Dead help” quest, glancing one last time at the adventurers, the family, and the beggars.\nPassing through the gate, he saw the mountain in the distance. “This place is so small.”\nLater, he reached the destination, a small cottage in the middle of the forest with a pond nearby. He was still within the boundaries of the city, but it was outside the city gates.\nA group of ducks and one bigger swan gathered on the vegetation. They all took turns eating the fallen leaf of a banana tree, and it took a good thirty minutes before Matthew wanted to leave.\nEventually, he knocked on the cottage door, smelling faint booze in the air. It wasn’t strong, but he knew that it was only a few hours since a bottle was opened.\nWhen a person with visibly long hair, a lady’s clothes, and a helmet emerged behind the door, he took a step back, worried that he might hurt her.\nHe had been worrying over the potential dangers of a lone cottage in the middle of the forest since he lived in one as well. Though, his cottage was only 250 meters away from the nearest neighbor.\n“Who are you?” said the woman. “Are you the first adventurer? I’ve been expecting one since last month. I’m surprised no one answered.”\n“Is that so?” Matthew didn’t know the frequency in which adventurers answered board quests at the previous location, among other details, so he couldn’t help her there.\n“Yes, it would be great if you guys answered quicker. Come with me.” She closed the door and led Matthew past a familiar place.\nMatthew remembered that an upside-down, unfinished canoe was here some time ago. He could still see the remnants of the wood used.\n“Was there a boat here?” he said.\nThe woman slowed down before halting completely. She smiled and said: “Yes. Why?”\n“Nothing. Just asking.”\nThe woman led him down a long slope on a muddy path. It reminded Matthew of the place where he first arrived here on this world.\nAs soon as they reached the end of the path, it led to a hill that took some effort to climb. But even when they reached the top, it kept going upward. It was a mountain after all.\nIn the end, the woman showed him a human body that had been decaying for a while now.\nMatthew stopped before manually breathing. “Okay, I’ll fix it up.”\nHe took out a bag big enough to fit the body and scooped the body up.\nOnce he was done, the woman led him back and inside the cottage, and she gave him soup to eat.\n“What’s this?”\n“Sopas.”\n“It’s good. It reminds me…” Sopas existed in this world too. If only he could eat rice here, then his sanity would be saved.\n“My mother used to cook it when I was little, but several years ago, she passed… I now live in this ancestral home of hers, and I have no one else to help me take care of it. Care to listen?”\n“Okay…?”\n“I would like you to stay with me for several days while I go look for a husband. It won’t take long, but I was hoping to sign a contract as well. I can beat anyone. It’s just that I’m worried that this cottage will go unattended to for too long. It has magical properties you see that require a constant supply of mana to prevent it from termite damage.”\n“Okay. So me being here is enough? Where’s this contract?”\nShe leaned backward, her eyes shifting around the inside of the cottage. She stood up suddenly and turned around. “Oh.” She opened cabinets, chests, and containers, looking for a specific paper. “This was hard to get, so I’m really hoping that I don’t lose it.”\n“Why? You can just get it… Oh.” Contracts usually were in the form of paper, and they were produced with the help of an adventurer guild.\n“Yeah, I had to walk a little. I don’t like walking even if I walk everyday and trek.”\nLater, she took the contract paper out from a small box. “Found it!”\nWhen she presented it to him, he took a deep breath and stared at the words. “That’s not a language that I know.”\n“Oh, shoot. That’s a letter from a friend.”\n“This looks elvish.”\n“Elvish?”\n“Yeah, I heard it from a friend, and I saw it from her too.”\n“Sophia?”\n“No—yeah, that’s her. How did you know?”\n“I met her 14 years ago at an event. Why? How do you know her?”\n“I met her 3 months ago. I was struggling that time, and she helped me.”\n“What’s she like now?”\n“I don’t know. What was she like before?”\n“Very loud.”\n“Very?”\n“Yeah, she would always boast about her new job as a healer’s assistant, and that was all I remember from her since we last met.”\n“Really?”\n“Yeah. How’s your Sophia?”\n“Well, Sophia now is normal…”\n“Normal?”\n“She’s fine with goblins dying, but that’s it.”\n“Everyone’s fine with goblins dying. What do you mean?”\n“Oh, I meant a different way of dying, but whatever. Continue.” He pointed at the contract paper.\nAfter he read the paper, he signed it, and the woman made her exit, leaving the cottage to him as proposed. Before signing, they exchanged personal details, and she said her full name was “Drakekiller Rollingthunder.”\n“Weird name as usual.” He furrowed his brows with a smile in good humor before turning around with thought. “Am I the weird one?”\nThe cottage was quiet, but it was enough to give him some peace of mind. Everything lately was been about progress and intervention, changing the landscape of goblins, humans, and monsters. It was hard for him not to find it all too bewildering.\nHis previous job on Earth was that of a coder, but now, he was a state-sanctioned murderer. Indeed, the government treated the removal of goblins similar to how they treated animals, farmland, and pests.\nTaking the forefront of his focus, birds called loudly with repeating sounds. It was strange, but it was the morning. So he wasn’t too bothered about it.\nHe saw many kinds of plants as he walked around the cottage. But he was most intrigued by the ducks, swan, and dog in sight.\nThis was the natural world that carried on unabated despite the fast life of the city.\nHe still had the body he collected earlier, but Drakekiller made him do the quest of staying here in this cottage. So he forgot about it.\nForgetting that reminded him of the [System], which reminded him of the older man and the disgusting man. They were just a series of ugly memories.\nHe remembered that this place was near the village that he, the late Marcher, and the rest of the adventurers in his first adventurer party visited.\nHe didn’t want to check it out because it represented troublesome memories of knowing that Marcher was dead, but it did remind him of the time he started making friends at the inn because that was around the time that happened. Many things happened in the first month he was in this world, but things slowed down around the second month. However, it was only in this last third month that he felt that he was finally becoming stable.\nIt was the fourth month now.\nSeated, he leaned against the table, laying his upper body against it.\nHe descended to mindfulness.\nMeanwhile, two adventurers were walking nearby, having incapacitated a goblin. They had been dragging it for 5 kilometers. They passed by several village, the edge of the city, and many cottages, but it was only now that they decided to stop.\nMatthew heard them and went outside, greeting them with a polite wave.\nWhen the two sat down on the ground, Matthew hesitated between accomodating them inside or having a conversation with them outside.\nWhen he decided, he sat on his haunches in front of them and joined their conversation.\n“Remember when they killed that white-fleshed dude at the tournament?” said one of the adventurer, a 26-year-old woman named “Abyssalfurnace.” “It was fucking awesome!”\n“Yeah,” said the second adventurer, a 24-year-old man named “Herblord.” “It was so awesome that they didn’t notice preparing the spell before it was already too late. He managed to punish them real hard. It was crazy that he was able to pull that off though. If he picked better spells, he would have won either way, but the fact that he was allowed because he picked rotten spells. And the fact that he pulled it off. That guy was pretending to be weak!”\n“Yeah, it’s so weird seeing someone with such a high level of finesse with bad abilities. If I was him, I would exchange it fast, but honestly, maybe it’s better. I’ve seen how flexible they can be used, but they’re usually not good at anything in particular. So I don’t really see why I should be flexible when I can just pick the abilities that counter common build paths.”\nMatthew added: “Oh, I don’t know what tournaments you’re talking about, but I have seen the one at Jussu Forest.” He was referring to the one that Rodney had shown him and where he learned about spells more from the skill practitioner.\nHe immediately remembered his conversations with his brothers about video games. They were usually like this.\nAfter nostalgically reminiscing for a moment, he continued to listen.\nAbyssalfurnace said: “Yeah, my favorite combo in this case was the combination of [Whirlwind Waltz] and [Spectral Strike]. That’s a strong combination, right?”\nHerblord said: “No, not really. There are better combinations. I’d say that [Shifting Shadows] and [Whirlwind Waltz] is better since it’s more spammable and safer. But some damage is fine. Of course, I’ve only judging based on what I’ve seen.”\nMatthew knew these spells from the spell list the [System] had showed him, but the more they talked, the more they mentioned spells he didn’t know.\nAfter the discussion, Abyssalfurnace and Herblord left, pulling along the goblin still struggling against the ropes.\nMatthew was starting to think that this was all a video game, especially with the names. He didn’t realize it earlier, but people’s names read exactly like usernames.\nHe looked around and almost had an existential crisis, but people never mentioned anything like a “real life” or modern politics or anything. So it was likely only that this world resembled video games a lot.\nIf this was just like a video game, maybe, all he had to do was rank up or level up. If he grinded for experience, levels, and new skills, then maybe the [System] would help him more.\nHe realized that he had been subjecting this entire world to his idea of real life since that was all he knew. And this world was pretty much reality.\nHe couldn’t pretend that this world was a video game because he was not sitting at a computer desk playing video games. He was walking around in real life and seeing things in real life.\nHis bias was natural, yet he wished he saw the world as a video game much sooner.\nIn the end, all the suffering really made this world feel like living in modern day, but with even more suffering. It didn’t have that dreamy and comforting aspect of games. It was hell since the first day.\nHe looked at his only spell again.\nWhirlwind Waltz (Level 1)\nCost: 100 Mana\nCooldown: 8 hours\nCast Time: 0.5\nEffect Radius: 250\nActive: The user gracefully dances, channeling for 0.5 seconds, colors flashing around them. After the channel, they create a whirlwind of energy around them that lasts for 4 seconds. Enemies within the whirlwind are lifted off the ground, unable to move or attack for 1.5 seconds. After the whirlwind dissipates, affected enemies are slowed by 30% for 2 seconds.\nDuration: 4 seconds\nImmobilization Duration: 1.5 seconds\nSlow Duration: 2 seconds\n“I wonder… can I actually level this up?”\nChapter 18 - The Transformation of Witchman linkMatthew changed his name and adopted a new persona—“Witchman.”\nWitchman looked around inside an inn and discovered several different doors through which he could enter. He didn’t want to bother anyone, but he was beginning to get the feeling that he was already bleeding through the cracks. These doors were imaginary, as they were actually groups of people that offered distinct opportunities, depending on how well he was received.\nThe more he invested into destroying his old self, the more smoother he would integrate into this world.\nAfter finding out that none of the groups were willing to engage with him, he visited the adventurer guild as if nothing happened, claiming a corner where he could set up and wait for newbies to enter the guild. From time to time, children around the ages of 11 to 17 entered the guild, looking to join an adventurer party about to head to a quest.\nSo having prepared himself nicely, sitting by himself, he managed to absorb 0 children.\nBut that was alright. He waited several days, abandoning several commitments.\nThe guild was also on the remote side of town, far from the general area he encountered people he knew.\nAfter waiting for two hours everyday for several weeks, he realized that this was fruitless; however, he was able to relax himself in the meantime, considering that he was burnt out. Sure, his momentum had stopped, but taking breaks was the only way he could tear apart new ground.\nWitchman walked to a nearby inn where he sat down and decided to try approaching goblins in the forest to test out their willingness to engage with him. He wanted to know if he could convince them to play along with him somehow. He wanted to try simple requests with the promise of reward, but he didn’t know it was possible. He was experimenting. This was all one wild hypothetical, but if he was right, the rewards were priceless.\nAt the inn, he mouthed: “Should I call them? Nah…”\nWhen he went to the forest, he was quickly apprehended by the wind, striking him forward and bolstering him. It turned him into a determined freak on the loose.\nHe came upon a goblin that spotted him, but he was faster at long distances, catching him by the neck.\nFor some reason, the wildness tucked in his heart burst out, zooming through and all around the goblins’ body. A finger explored every inch of the goblin’s neck, as a blade reached out from his side, frightening the goblin.\nAfter this encounter, he tied it up and sat on his haunches, standing up periodically due to muscle ache.\n“I need your help,” he said.\nThe goblin understood. “Of what kind?”\n“The kind that allows me to see if you’re capable of doing simple tasks.” Along with his mention of “tasks,” he revealed a dangling bag of coins. “I need to see hands.”\nThe goblin understood again, raising his head before nodding. “I can do it.”\n“Good…” Witchman grinned.\nSeveral days later, Witchman saw the same goblin here again, having tried checking the adventurer guild again for anyone willing to partner with him. Today, he brought two 15-year-olds and the goblin together. “What’s next?” he asked to verify their understanding.\n“We’ll be looking around for any hidden entrances,” said the 15-year-olds.\nWitchman said: “Yes, that’s right. I’ve always wondered how easy magic can manipulate the earth, and now I’m wondering whether there are underground tunnels that I can’t see.”\nAs soon as they looked around, the children immediately found signs of digging, but Witchman, after coming over, recognized that it might have just been someone disturbing the ground.\nHe concluded that this was fruitless and abandoned the mission, paying the children and the goblin for their work.\nAgain, he went to the adventurer guild, but this time, he joined a party looking for a healer. He offered his skills as a healer, and they led him to a dungeon.\nThere, Witchman healed several domesticated goblin miners.\nDeeper in the dungeon, giant scorpions and spiders roamed around.\nWitchman waited for the adventurers to move. As soon as one spider came close where the adventurers hid behind the corner, the fight began.\nThe spider was strung along and beaten around, being pulled and pushing in various directions. Eventually, it collapsed with part of its head missing.\nSpiders and scorpions kept their distance since they didn’t want to get stuck in the chokepoint where the adventurers were. This space that led to the entrance where the goblin miners worked was too tight for the giant monters. And the area and passage only grew tighter the closer the monsters approached the adventurers.\nAs soon as the monsters detected magic and ranged attacks, they backed off behind the corners.\nWitchman was expected to move forward with the adventurers, since this could very well result in poisoning and subsequent death.\nIf he didn’t heal them fast enough, they would die, which was why they didn’t go yet. The adventurers had planned to chip away at the monsters, hoping to get lucky today. However, they only killed one spider. As a result, they postponed the quest until tomorrow.\nThe next day, Witchman and two other healers joined the adventurers’ frontal assault.\nThis led to numerous scratches and instances of bleeding that required the healers’ quick attention.\nThe adventurers were composed of seven individuals: a barbarian, a foot soldier, a red dwarf, an archer, an elven spearman, a beastman, and a bard.\nThe barbarian moved next to the foot soldier and the beastman. The red dwarf, the archer, the elven spearman, and the bard stayed at the flanks.\nThe beastman used a screaming spell to distort several enemies’ vision.\nThe foot soldier mitigated damage by casting a shielding spell upon the barbarian and the beastman. She himself stayed a short distance behind to slash any flank attacks within their small formation.\nThe bard sung quickly to slow down pouncing spiders. She also was the one who stunned scorpions during their attack movement.\nThe archer finished off stunned scorpions since that was the most accurate time to shoot. That was her sole objective.\nThe eleven spearman kept watch at smaller spiders trying to attack near the rear, striking them down with precise thrusts. His movement was limited since the smaller monsters commanded a wider arc of attack due to their size.\nThe red dwarf stomped the eggs that the spiders summoned during the fight. If they were left alone, they birthed small spiders. Since he had a blacksmith’s physical prowess, he could smash the hard eggs easily with brute smithing strength. But he was vulnerable during this time since the eggs were situated among the enemies.\nThe barbarian and foot soldier safeguarded the red dwarf by taunting the enemies and blitzkrieging through the enemies. As a result, during their weak disengage, the healers focused on keeping them alive.\nThe beastman kept the group alive by standing still an waiting for an opportunity to engage, having the strongest damage and the weakest disengage.\nThe fight continued, and several monsters had spells of their own, managing to pin down the red dwarf and stunning him long enough for the elven spearman to have to step in. Since the spearman was distracted, the archer stopped her shooting at the scorpions to finish off the uncontested small monsters. The bard didn’t stop stunning scorpions and slowing down spiders, but the scorpions didn’t die.\nSo the barbarian and foot soldier disengaged to regroup and shift their focus on the scorpions.\nAfter they helped finish off the small monsters that tried killing them, the beastman went in to defend the group from the scorpions that were increasing in numbers.\nDefending the group resulted in a lost opportunity for him to go in at the perfect time to annihilate them all.\nThe group retreated slightly, bringing the monsters closer to the chokepoint.\nThe monsters were attacking much more frontally now, but the small monsters were increasing in numbers since most of them were far at the back. These ones climbed the walls and engaged in aerial assaults, jumping like projectiles that venom.\nThis was impossible to defeat, so the party retreated, killing off the smaller monsters that could continue the chokepoint. Since the party had a strong advantage here, the monsters retreated; ultimately, the party was the one who lost.\nAt the end of the assault, the party rested, returning to the entrance.\nOn the next attack, the party focused on keeping the enemies at a distance by relying on the archer and the bard to keep the enemy back. They also had hired two mages and two archers to add to the count.\nTheir range attacks stopped the monsters from pushing into the chokepoint enough that the eggs could easily spawn without interference. Since the smaller monsters died after a short amount of time after spawning, the eggs had to be spawned during the fight.\nA group of monsters made an effective formation, charging via a flank far from the center of ranged fire. Consequently, the rest of the melee adventurers zoned them out, frustrating them.\nIn response to the party’s new strength, more monsters flooded in to support the defence.\nSince the new monsters were numerous enough to demand caution of possible skills, the adventurers backed off. This allowed the monsters to reach the chokepoint again and control it as an objective.\nOn the third attack, the adventurers shot far-range attacks at the chokepoint to scare off the monsters stationed there. They were also checking for spells from the monsters.\nAfter placing a ward that revealed the monsters briefly before being destroyed, the frontline adventurers burst forward, slaying the several monsters stationed there. The rest of the monsters were charging already to prevent the adventurers from taking full control enough to shoot them from afar again.\nHowever, the adventurers had hired several enchanters to block their path immediately with short-range disruptive spells.\nThe party regained control of the monster wave, slaying tens of them suddenly.\nThe area became a new objective.\nAt the end of the assault, the leaders gathered everyone together for payment, relaxing.\nSince Witchman didn’t have qualifications, he was not paid as handsomely as the two other healers. It wasn’t as if he did as well as them anyway.\nThe quest ended like that, with the adventurers mentioning that the next stretch inside the dungeon was too challenging for now.\nChapter 19 - The Forum’s Guidance linkAfter several days, the [System] returned to talk to him, but it had something in mind.\nHaving been following hundreds of interesting individuals in this world, it offered Witchman a new solution as a reward for an entertaining perfomance during the previou quest.\nThis solution was the ability to use the private messaging function of the [System].\nWitchman, when he saw it, didn’t know how to respond, having spent so much time already delving deep in this world and growing tired emotionally from all the pressure and suffering. Even if he killed others with a smile on his face, he did it because he felt that nothing else could be done. He had to detach himself from the old world.\nFirst, he said impetuously: “What’s this all about? First, you don’t answer my questions. Now, you reveal yourself to me like nothing happened. If there is a reason, do tell.” Even if he might consider himself an intellectual, he had an intellectual blind spot when it came to the [System], blaming it for bringing him here in the first place. It was the sole reason why he was now dead in his old world. It killed him and turned him into something he didn’t want to be. How could he ever forgive it? Even if he was rational, some things just looked for a beating.\nThe [System] ignored him and forced him to send a friend request to a particular person named “Mark Reader”.\n[Witchman 💀💀💀: Hello, I forgot that I shouldn’t be contacting newbies. But welcome to the world. I’m also from Earth. I notice you’ve been ignoring my friend requests for a while now, so I’ve been spamming you the whole time. Plus, I notice your name’s changed? How did you do that? Weren’t you Sophia Strong before?]\nThese were the [System]’s words, particularly since it had been trying to contact Sophia Strong for a while now. But Sophia died, so it wanted to see how Mark Reader responded.\nThe [System] was a manager of millions of people.\n[Mark Reader: Oh nice!]\nLooking at everything that happened recently, Witchman reflected on his life. He wanted to abandon the past, as three months was already too long to know someone. Back on Earth, he remembered knowing people over the course of 6 years, but he only met them every few months at events. Three months of having regular contact with someone in the same city was enough to make Witchman tired of it all. He wanted to get away. Maybe, if he was a child again, he would be content with exploring the world from 11 years old to 16 years old again. But he was 25 years old, and he was already mature enough to know when to quit if it was already beginning to consume him. In the end, all of those things he considered successes were all part of a broader picture, system, and community that he could never truly comprehend in a deeper level. All he could was be normal again and save himself despite all the success his job and his life offered him at hte time. He wanted to escape being top 1 rising adventurer. He wanted to escape being all of that. He just wanted to be human again.\nHe hurried out of there and disappeared where he returned to the adventurer guild, his head becoming clearer when he discovered the [Forums]. He wsan’t only now capable of private messaging. He could only see a forum where he could post and chat. It was exactly like back on Earth with the Internet, but with the [System].\nSince he wanted to leave the past behind, he ventured forth and decided to begin posting. He created three new threads in the category “General”. Their titles were the following.\n[Found diamond at 65 y.]\n[Survive the disasters ist still the best spell.]\n[Ninja tabis!]\nThey were all references from his favorite video games, but the [System] had already told him that most of the people here were not from Earth.\nHowever, he soon got a reply on his thread.\n[poker_man29: ? Where can I get this]\nHe didn’t want to continue the conversation, so he looked around himself, being inside an inn again.\nThe inn was composed of two floors with a lobby room and a kitchen-dining room attached to a bathroom and a yard outside for clothes and washing dishes. The second floor was where the three rooms were located. These rooms ranged from medium-sized with a window and a bathroom to small with little wind to a little under medium-sized with a window and a balcony.\nHe was currently sitting at the lobby, laying his back against a bamboo seat. The windows were made of metal with strange patterns. Whenever someone tried to touch it or play around with the window frames, the inn keeper told them off.\nHe tried so many things, but nothing really worked. He realized that doing things alone was too difficult, and experimenting took too long to bear any significant fruit. He had only one option remaining—the [Forums].\nHe checked the forums and asked for help, being anonymous.\n[Witchman 💀💀💀 What should I do everyone? I’ve been trying my best to work it out on my own as an adventurer, but it seems that this world is pretty much set on killing me.]\nHe noticed that around 7,000 people were online in the whole forum, but the members were even greater at around 10 million.\nSeveral people answered him quickly, saying that he should just buy orbs and spell manuscripts in order to rank up quickly. It was often cheaper to focus on spam-buying these items to make sure that one got the benefits of a higher rank. It was only about benefits and standing. Even if one’s skills were not that high, as long as one proved himself to be effective and flexible, they would succeed quickly.\nWitchman was surprised because none of his adventurer friends heeded this advice. In fact, none of them said a word about spell manuscripts or orbs. He came to the conclusion that he had been stuck in a community that was lackluster in fighting skill and knowledge.\nHe thanked the replies and continued asking what kind of orbs and spell manuscripts were the best and where could he get them.\nThe replies swarmed him with details, saying that it was advisable to avoid markets in the meantime and focus on exploring villages that often generated manuscripts. They explained that each community magically received iron golems overtime, but they also received spell manuscripts and orbs. Some replies said that near the heart of cities where population was highest, the government often grabbed them and ensured that they never fell into adventurer hands to maintain their power. But in villages, they didn’t greed over them as much, so they just tucked it away. As for the reason why adventurers and foot soldiers didn’t just take manuscripts from villages, it was because the city gave towns and villages the right to keep any generated loot they received.\nWitchman asked why the city didn’t just create thousands of villages to maximize producing spell manuscripts and such.\nHe got replies that corrected him, saying that villages didn’t necessarily produce manuscripts faster. In fact, cities generated manuscripts the fastest, but they often used this to make their cities cheap to live in. It was much more collaborative. This contradicted an earlier statement that said that the government were greedy to maintain power. Then, he realized that the replies were divided in their opinions when it came to the government.\nIn the end, he got some context, but nothing conclusive.\nSince he now called himself Witchman, he registered as a new adventurer, giving him time to explore easy quests. He did this only after he made the quest with the goblin and the two fifteen-year-olds since his privileges to hire others the way he did would be lost.\nAfter all his attempts to distance himself, he pulled the pin and contacted certain six adventurers he knew, agreeing to meet at the city.\nHe wore a yellow jacket with silver markings over a purple surcoat, a heavy-duty belt, among other accessories.\nAs soon as he reached a meeting place at a cafeteria, he noted several older men, worried he would meet the crazy old man again.\nOver the course of thirty minutes, the six adventurers appeared one by one, sitting down and talking about tournaments, employees, and co-workers. It was a typical conversation held between those a step above the pauper.\nWitchman saw them with his more accustomed eyes.\nZephyrine Quill—a man wearing a silver-colored frame shaped like a curved horn around his head, a brown surcoat, red tunic, and short trousers, sporting hairy legs and large feet—opened up his book, putting on his glasses and leafing to a particular page, showing it to Thaddeus. He was particular about the way he leafed his pages, worried that he might disturb the peace that the books held for so long in their smooth carefulness. “Finish this quote,” he said, his voice dark and crispy like loaves of bread crushed upon one another. “It’s supposed to be the longest.”\nThaddeus Pumpernickel—a man holding several ducks belonging to his children, having brought them to keep them fed while his wife and children were away from home—said, “‘The best know how to wield it’—was it?” His arms looked thin, but as soon as he reached out, his arms bulged, showing off a hidden side of his more caring personality. His sword was in a sheathe, and it was a matter of personality whether one brought a weapon or not, as many mage societies considered it indiscreet and rude to do so. He wore a large cloak that allowed him to disguise his usually humble form with a broader and more sturdy demeanor.\nSeraphina Wisteria—a woman with an angelic blouse embracing her legs and keeping her waist unhindered. The loosest aspects of her blouse sprouted in the form of extra cloth flaps arranged throughout her sleeves like plates of armor. Her face was strongly defined, but her chin was smooth, harmonizing with her round bends of her shoulders. Her blouse was split into several different blends: purple-yellow, red-blue, and black-white. Inspired by Witchman’s former party, she incorporated the purple-yellow mix into her outfit. Her smile was radiant, tearing away the weaknesses her free-flowing and adventurous blouse might exude. She sat down next to Thaddeus, gazing at the small bumps in her cut mango.\nMortimer Quixote was a man looking forward to a good show, having donned several different small tomahawks behind his back. He didn’t like sitting down too much, so he was often standing around and openly pointing at the sky whenever he made a point. “Richard didn’t get matched with the right guy. He fell apart so fast! Honestly, didn’t think he’s make it that far. But the fact that he was willing to change his name and go ahead with the tournament after that. Commendable!” He was referring to the tournaments.\nCalliope Snickerdoodle, a woman slowly walking away from the group, buying several amulets that she then wore. As soon as she wore them, they disappeared, becoming absorbed into her stats. She grew stronger each time she consumed a new and distinct enough amulet. It was one of her passive skills [Dog Tag Matcher]. She only wore a pale-red tunic with short sleeves and underwear. “I didn’t think they’d actually make it!” she said. Despite her simpler look, she had a boisterous voice at times.\nBartholomew Wombatish was a young man acting as a representative for his boss. He wore the usual adventurer outfit. He merely smiled subtly and gave a concise answer in response to any questions or statements toward him.\nChapter 20 - Being Honest For Once linkWitchman watched the six adventurers talking, and his voice was immediately high as part of his plan to keep them engaged: “Isn’t it great that we’re all here together?”\nBut Calliope saw through him and immediately called him out: “What are you saying? Are we going to the tournament or not?”\nWitchman tried again: “Do you guys remember when I was able to get so many people together? I was wondering if we could do that again.”\nBartholomew didn’t get what he was trying to say, so he proclaimed, “We can just wait until Mr. Ron has the resources. He’s the one who really got us all together. It’s a good thing Michel is already helping out with the quests on the south.”\nWitchman’s third try involved him showing them the various weapons and armor he bought throughout his time in this world. He said that if they helped him, he would give these equipment to them.\nBut Mortimer was not that impressed, so with a loud voice, he put him down: “It’s not that good. Don’t kid yourself.”\nWitchman tried for the fourth time, expressing that he could easily help them as a warder.\nThe adventurer who hadn’t spoken yet, Seraphina, smirked. “Your skills are not that good, but thanks for being here anyway.” She didn’t sound sincere at all. She made it sound as if he was just a peasant groveling before them all this time.\nWitchman didn’t understand. He thought he was the one pulling the strings. When was he the fallen one? When was he the man being convinced that he was better? Wasn’t it supposed to be them?\nHe didn’t realize it, but no matter how much he knew, it would never compare to those who lived in this world. So anything he offered was a mere joke compared to what adventurers really had.\nHis self-perception was false and built on a dream. All this time, the trauma from getting tortured from the goblins contributed to his desire to cope by perceiving his circumstances as exceedingly in his favor. But he was wrong.\nHe watched the adventurers standing before him with a perspective. Was he an adventurer? Was he a fraud? The thing was… these adventurers didn’t even look that serious or angry with him. In fact, it was almost as if they were in tune and stating an established fact.\nWhen did he become so delusional?\nHe stopped himself and remembered everything again. All this time of getting help from others and perceiving himself as the maestro of all the operations around him was his own arrogance.\nThe fact that he was easily repelled by the six adventurers confirmed that he didn’t have a strong hold on them this whole time.\nHe already knew that people were fickle, but he didn’t think it would to this degree.\nNo, he was great. He had to be. All this time, effort, and struggle had to mean something. He couldn’t just accept that he was a fraud.\nHe gritted his teeth, but he couldn’t just walk away.\nMaybe, he was just being sensitive about his ego and misunderstanding things.\nSo he tried for the fifth time because he didn’t like the way the discussion ended earlier: “What can I do?”\n“Just talk to your seniors Deathbringer and Sophia. They know much better than you do.”\n“What?” He didn’t hide his shock. Deathbringer and Sophia were so immature compared to him. He had gone so far just for them to be above him.\nHe had to calm himself. His thoughts were becoming irrational due to how much success he had achieved and how much independence he now held. He was hiding insecurities, so it was natural for him to be easily offended to the point of defending himself at every turn.\nHe trusted these people. It didn’t make sense that they were betraying him now. He worked so hard to make these people happy. He worked so hard to survive in this world and go through the struggles these people did. And they were abandoning him?\nHe didn’t deserve this.\nIt wasn’t right. It wasn’t correct.\nHe saw the sun, a symbol of power. He deserved it. He wanted it.\nHe tried again to calm his thoughts, but he was so pissed off.\nHe didn’t get it. He thought he could just murder goblins and do things that no one else could do in an impossibly short amount of time without experiencing any setbacks and repercussions. So now all of that was a lie? Why? He didn’t understand. It couldn’t be. He deserved his success, and he was being gaslit into believing that he was a fraud.\nHe was so in shock because no one ever treated him this way. No one ever questioned him. No one treated him like he was nothing. He had been spoiled this whole time? No way! He deserved this success and power. Sure, others helped him, but it couldn’t have been done without him. He was practically the sole reason he was here!\nWas he a child being carried along? Was he a figurehead? Was this the case?\nHe started to reflect.\nHe was frail when he first came here, practically a baby being ruined. He couldn’t bear to think about the torture. He couldn’t bear it.\nHe remembered Sophia and how she saved him. But it didn’t make sense. How the hell did he even live? She healed him, and he just accepted it. But later, he doubted that he could just accept it like that forever. So he soon went to Sophia to ask her about healing. He later learned healing himself with the Kindness quest. But why the hell was he wrong about everything? The [System] was guiding him this whole time and even gave him skills. Was he wrong to believe that the [System] was right about him? Or was he interpreting the [System] wrong this whole time? He didn’t understand why everything he built was all his own self-perception. He wasn’t arrogant. He really did put in the effort. He was sorry that he said that he was the sole reason for his success. But he still wanted to understand what the hell happened. He went to the war and saw people die. So was that what caused him to think that things were like that? He wasn’t mentally unstable. He was able to get so many things done, and he got burned out at times. But there was no way that he was wrong about everything.\nHe wasn’t a fraud. He was being lied to.\nHe stood up and left. He was being gaslit. There was no way everything he knew was a lie.\nBut why did these six adventurers do this to him? Weren’t they his friends? Why did they say those words? Why did they just treat him like shit?\nHe didn’t understand.\nWhy did people do things anyway?\nWhy was he here?\nWhy did he go through all the effort?\nHe couldn’t have been so traumatized to have become delusional. He was clearly fine. He was only tired in the night and sometimes got angry. He sometimes became impulsive, but he learned how to cope just fine. He made sure to take breaks and take care of himself. He thought about the goblins a lot, but did he? Did he really think about what he felt about the goblins?\nHe never questioned himself. He never questioned his behavior.\nHe was doing things, and he didn’t know why. All he knew was that he was doing the things he was doing.\nWas it because this society engineered him to be that way? To be the way he was right now. To have done the things he had done?\nHe didn’t do them. It was this society that caused him to be this way.\nBut he used to be a regular guy with a life back on Earth. He wasn’t at all weird or strange that he would become evil enough to kill anything.\nBut why did he kill goblins?\nWhy did he go to battles and tear out goblin flesh with a spear?\nWhy could he do it? How did he do it? He had so much potential.\nYet, he never questioned himself.\nWas he just being dragged along all this time?\nHe didn’t have time to think about things.\nWas it all a lie? No, it couldn’t be. He had fun. He had friends. He had great experiences. He was happy.\nBut he ran away from it all to become someone else. He was Witchman now.\nWhy did he run? Did he knew that this was the case?\nWas he pretending all this time?\nHe was, wasn’t he?\nHe couldn’t keep pretending for too long.\nHe couldn’t keep being that guy. Top 1 rising adventurer. Greatest man in the world. He chuckled.\nIn the end, all those expectations people had of him were right, but they were also wrong.\nHe did do his best, and he succeeded. But he couldn’t handle it anymore.\nHe never addressed the issues, but now he was.\nHe was now Witchman because he wanted a break.\nBut he realized it had been many days now.\nHe didn’t want that life at all.\nHe never had time to think about things without having a schedule on his back. Even when he took a break, he was already planning to leave to meet people at events and quests and all these plans.\nHe realized he never truly had a break.\nHe walked to the forest.\nHow could he be such a fool?\nHe was being tasked to be something that he wasn’t.\nNo, maybe he was misinterpreting things. The adventurers were not mad at him. They were not saying that he was doing nothing necessarily. He might have misunderstood.\nHe was already having doubt about being a fraud, and he misunderstood.\nHe returned to the six adventurers. “Hey guys, you were just kidding right?”\n“What?” said one of them. “Did you leave because of that? I mean, of course we were joking.”\n“No, I was just surprised. I just went for a walk to check… around… I’m new to the place is all.”\nHe needed to forget what he just did. He felt ashamed for overreacting, but he realized now just how overwhelming his life was to be this fragile. He was practically a toothpick one second away from bursting.\nIt still didn’t make sense to him.\nHe had negative preconceptions of himself.\nIt’s not that he had been treated badly. In fact, he had mostly been treated well by others. But he was someone who had only recently came to this fantasy magical world. He was transported from Earth only about three months prior. So his massive success was relatively quick.\nHe did make sure to take breaks and take care of himself regularly throughout the three months, but he was still struggling. How unfortunate!\nIn the end, he was wrong about adventurers’ words. It humanized him because it showed that the adventurers didn’t see him as a god or maestro but as a fellow person. So they weren’t surprised that he was struggling in his own way. They treated him like a person, and it was an accident that their joking got misinterpreted, especially since Witchman hadn’t been communicative about his personal struggles. In other words, if he shared more about his vulnerabilities before, this situation wouldn’t have happened. Certainly, he only cried in front of someone several times in this world as far as he knew, and he didn’t know how to express his struggles without doing so. So he had avoided the topic to preserve his sense of dignity.\nAll in all, they resumed discussing about important matters while tasting delicious food.\nFor the first time in a long time, he was sure that he could do anything in this world, having been able to be honest with himself for once. It wasn’t about being honest with others more than with himself.\nChapter 21 - Embracing the Epitome: A Journey Towards Self-Realization linkWitchman began to look around the city. Now that he was much more confident, he immediately paid attention to his surroundings in order to cultivate his intelligence.\nThese were his findings as well as his interpretations of his environment, both put through the lens of his Earth knowledge and his gained knowledge as an adventurer that had been socially active for three months on this world.\nAn inn pressed against the foot of a hill, reaching out with its bamboo-fabricated frame and stilts and thatched roofing, its overhangs stretching widely, the floor made of breathable, rain-proof slats. When it came to its regulars, their feet had acclimated to the heat absorbed by the pebble steps leading inside. The sun spread heat throughout the outdoor area, warming many pebbles but ultimately concluding with a visual diagonal cut, missing the other pebbles under the overhangs within the shade. The use of pebbles as steps was the customary method of constructing paths.\nPresumably, pebble steps were standard even if they accrued heat because they were more breathable, cooler, and cheaper than cobblestone paths and better than direct mud. For baby-sensitive shoe-loving feet like Witchman’s though, pebbles were still unbearably hot that he insisted on wearing sandals. Going barefoot, with its better traction and adaptability, was more normal since the land expected much more naked interaction with the most diverse flora and fauna that rainforests hosted, the mountainous terrain, and the moving of huts, among others.\nAnyway, in addition to the inn, instead of towers, trees and plants loomed, overshadowing hundreds of adventurers on their way to work, each of them thankful for the cool air. Meanwhile, two separating children played around off the tower’s influence out in the sun before they were beckoned back.\nIndeed, towers were discouraged: they were highly vulnerable to tropical heat and the regular flooding and typhoons without some technological or magical form of air conditioning. One-floor stilted bamboo huts with large windows and air-holes distributed throughout the bamboo slats were much more sustainable for the everyday person. Moreover, these huts could easily be moved by a group of hands and dismantled if needed, and that was done relatively frequently, sometimes three times in 20 years. Alternatively, from time to time, multi-floor bamboo structures were built and lasted, but they rarely reached the size and bulk of medieval towers, often looking like skeletons or frames instead of monoliths.\nThe trees, the huts, the pebble steps, and the inn only represented a few features of his Byzantine environment.\nThe nearby adventurer guild itself, in combination with the bridges, the graveyards, and long swathes of land, provided a sense of stability. At the scene, hundreds of wagons trolled along toward dungeon excursions, holding large containers of fresh food, water, and expendable adventurer items like potions, breaking orbs, and one-use spell manuscripts. As for weapons, armor, and shields, those equipment were handled and maintained by the accompanying blacksmiths, who were coincidentally switching places with those who were now leaving from the dungeon. The purpose of the convoy was to do their part in keeping the resources flowing and the activities supplied with lifeblood.\nIt reminded him of a particular orb he had seen in the [Forums], and he had already cast the necessary preparations to appropriate it.\nAfter spending enough time observing the landscape, he began traversing the road that led through a network of roads and paths, soon arriving at a small house: “Michel?” he said.\nThe wild card role could be attributed to Michel because she challenged Witchman on several fronts, particularly her necromancy with her necrotic arm and her admitted enjoyment of killing goblins. However, the fact that he knew her anchors—the city border and her house—cast doubt on her status as one.\nIn the end, he decided to clear things up with her and get along with his goals.\nFor context, even after putting himself out there as a maestro of sorts, he didn’t actually develop intimate connections insofar as he acted as a conductor. A conductor could only swing his orchestra to the tunes of music, but not to the tunes of every facet attributable to each individual performer’s life. So after the fighting ended, he was a stranger to them; the adventurers indeed lived adventerously, never tied down to a party or leader, always navigating their changing world.\nReturning to reality, moments after he called her name, Michel stared at him, having began weaving her hair with a toothpick. Her behavior was strange, but it put him at ease. The stranger people were, the easier it was to pinpoint what made them distinct. However, she could very well be putting on an strenuous act, but he didn’t have any reason to think that she bothered to do so. In other words, he was giving her the benefit of the doubt, considering their lengthy relationship and her recent, self-isolating behavior and struggles with her necrotic arm.\nHis deliberation could very well be non-existent, and things could still work out. But he couldn’t solely rely on quick thinking and impulsivity.\nMichel began speaking, her lips as soft as a fairy dove, the light bouncing off her cheeks like heavenly gates tearing through the weakness in the air, her brows like thunderous burn marks that revealed her gracious perseverance, her hair like dazzling rays of light, her limbs like soft pillows, her mouth like a song: “What are you doing?” She sounded like a wet pillow.\nHe was staring at her too much, his cheeks red. It didn’t make sense, but Michel struck him as someone he couldn’t control. That made him feel something—a draw toward her as an uncontrollable and unpredictable force. And that made her all the more alluring.\nHe realized that his intellect had shut down, and he was engaging in the present moment. “Oh, I was saying earlier that… I wanted to ask you about… Sophia and Deathbringer,” he said, his voice deep briefly before lifting a little.\n“Sure.” Her voice was weak and fragile, but it sounded like something that no one could ever miss. It sounded like a safe brutalist bastion standing thousands of kilometers tall that would hold him safe and keep him secure.\nWitchman was starting to realize that he was starting to feel strange. He never felt this lonely before, but maybe everything was finally crashing down after what happened. That happening was this whole life on this other world. Maybe he was finally addressing it by feeling something for once. After all the chaos and burnout, maybe he could finally let loose and be okay again. He did try. He did.\n“Matthew,” she said.\nHe couldn’t take it anymore.\nA tear dripped down his face.\nFor the longest time, he didn’t know what to say. He grew frustrated with himself. After everything he went through and did, he couldn’t even describe it?\nHe couldn’t speak, the sides of his mouth, cheeks, and chin feeling his stream of tears.\nMichel looked angry. “What! Who did this to you! What happened!”\nWitchman fell to the ground. He was tired of being weak and helpless, and he was tired of winning.\nHe was tired of winning.\nHe didn’t want to become something he was not anymore.\nHe was not that guy.\nMichel helped him up and sat him down. “Matthew, I know it’s been hard, but I want you to relax and take deep breaths while I go get you some food and a drink.” She opened the door, her chest moving up and down swiftly. She wouldn’t have been able to do this without him.\nShe went out, got some food, and returned to Matthew. “I’ve been here for the last week. I didn’t even hear about you until recently. Sophia told me you were not in the whole city. So they thought you must’ve left. When they heard about you recently, hours ago, they were so happy that they didn’t know what to say. They’re planning a celebration, but they still weren’t completely sure if you were coming. Why don’t you come? I’ll accompany you.”\nShe wouldn’t have been able to do this without him.\nMichel and Matthew soon went to the celebration after they ate.\nThere, Michel met Sophia and Deathbringer again, and Matthew was able to laugh and smile again. But this time, he said what he felt a little. That his family was gone. That everyone he ever knew had disappeared. That magic took him away from them. That everything he was wasn’t who he really was. He wasn’t. He couldn’t be.\nThat he couldn’t pretend forever.\nFor a while, they were happy.\nMatthew finally came to terms with his own existence, and he would encounter troubles along the way. But that was normal. If he ever wanted to rule the world, he would do with his friends this time. And he would do it knowing that he wasn’t pretending. He wanted to be himself, and he didn’t care about being perfect or someone or whatever. He just wanted to be normal again back with friends and family. He didn’t want to be the skeleton slayer, the goblin slayer…\nMeanwhile, Mawkery fidgeted with his fingers, staring from a throne. “This isn’t what I wanted,” he said, his voice low. The human armies were already making their way into his castle, and he didn’t have any other option left.\nHe teleported away, using a skill that broke through the teleportation limiters cast by the humans.\nReturning to Matthew, hours after the celebration, around 3 AM, he returned home after eating outside with Michel and a few others. At an inn, he looked outside the window, finding several figures levitating. He covered his face, hiding a wide grin. He knew that he had to do it.\nHe had to become perfection.\n“I deserve this—give it to me!” He reached for an orb, struggling with the figures for it, vying for its overwhelming power.\nHe couldn’t bear it anymore. He had to become everything he ever wanted to be.\nHe had to become the epitome of grace and beauty.\nThe terrifying faces of the various figures he had encountered haunted him, and he would not sit still while his nightmares haunted him day and night. This exacerbated his severe sensations of loss and grief from losing his family, friends, and old life and his greatly hidden guilt from killing goblins. Even more so, the closure and resolution from Michel and the others paradoxically boosted his resolve, confirming his biases.\nHe would become irrepressible.\nThe witch orb fell into his hands, and he cackled like a maniac. “Mine! Mine! Mine!” Each proclamation was a cavernous death growl.\nChapter 22 - Shadows of Progress linkName: Matthew Cruz\nLevel: 42\nCurrent experience: 8\nSpecies: Human\nAge: 25\nSkills: [Whirlwind Waltz]\nSpells: None / None\nVitality: 15\nQuests: [Bridge of Knowledge]\nTitles: [Goblin Slayer], [Skeleton Slayer]\nHe checked the two titles.\n[The Goblin Slayer title boosts all damage dealt to goblins by 12%.]\n[The Skeleton Slayer title boosts all damage dealt to skeletons by 12%.]\nAs for the orb’s origin, it was delivered here with the help of a several people at the [Forums]. The [Forums] had many powerful people willing to patronize and extend their influence across the world, so they hoped to contract others willing to increase their power.\nThe [Forums] accelerated people’s growth many times over, so he was taking part in a secret society comprised of 10 million people.\nAs for how exactly the orb was delivered, it involved the help of the figures, several beings from the spirit realm, who didn’t pose much of a threat. As part of a deal with one particular client from the [Forums], the figures brought it from far away, traveling through the spirit realm, which had little respect for physical distance. After Witchman took it, they returned as part of the end of the deal involved. Of course, he was made to sign a contract that created a magical bond that updated his current location and [System] status to the client. Moreover, they agreed to keep a line open for requests with accompanying rewards, as long as both parties remained in agreement regarding the terms.\nWitchman was not one to waste an opportunity, having collaborated with many people already. This occasion was linear with his journey.\nNow, regarding the benefits the orb presented, it weakened the attack speed of enemies within 500 units by 20%.\nAnd according to the [System], 500 units was 2 meters. This also meant that [Whirlwind Waltz] was only 1 meter radius.\nOverall, the orb would vastly cripple his opponents who operated more like melee fighters than mages.\nReturning to reality, he slept in his inn room, getting up the next day to take on a quest with his friends again at the beginner dungeons.\nHere, they were naturally full of life and characterized by plentiful individuals set on taking on the first steps of adventuring. But this was where it all ended. Most people only took the first steps before leaving for good, finding a new life among the masses. Adventurer, despite its common and confident place in culture, was exclusive to those willing to take on the risks of death. And that wasn’t feasible for too long. Most people never found gold and made it up the ranks in a short amount of time. It was only people like Witchman, who found themselves in a precarious situation where the only risks they had were the risks of ignorance and confusion. So adventuring was a light in the dark that gave them access to people willing to fight by his side and tell him about the world. In that risk of death, he found a place that he could be sane, because in the urban, civil world, everyone turned away from him. He was all fitted in with the brutes, the rude, the arrogant, the full-of-themselves, the childish, the mysterious, and the mentally unstable, all actually embedded into the adventurer lifestyle. But everyone hated death, even if it was strewn around in mosaics and cultural objects.\nThe only thing people wanted was to live safely, so in that darkness, violence, and death, they hoped to find an other side.\nThe beginners’ voices rattled him out of his mixed mental state.\n“Hey, you know you don’t have to do, David? We can always come back and try again.”\n“But it’s not my first time anyway. I came here seeing my Dad come… there.” The owner of the voice pointed at a dungeon entrance with its rough bumps and messy floor, wood splinters, dirt, and glass fragments piled up on one side all the way to the dungeon. Hints of red trails made way to the first stretch inside the dungeon.\nIn another conversation, sarcasm seethed in a voice: “Maybe, you should try addressing the potion problem. Dropping it was a doozy.”\n“Nah… finally, we got her,” said another voice from another party, turning to a woman with disheveled hair exiting the dungeon and holding up a goblin head. “Nice reward!” It was unusual for adventurers to come out the same way they came in, but for beginners and adventurers who only cared about grabbing the scraps left behind by stronger adventurers, this was common.\nAnother conversation made Witchman turn his head around: “The healer’s been pretty late lately, huh?” He waited for his fellow adventurers to get angry at the healer guy, but when they didn’t, he matched their mood. “I haven’t really grabbed all our things yet, so it’s good.” He left to grab more bags a distance away where he and his fellows dropped earlier from a public transport wagon. Once there, he grabbed two containers at a time, sometimes a crate, often a large bag with various banana fiber ropes keeping it from opening up on its own. When he returned, he was quickly greeted coincidentally by the wandering look of Witchman, who was now operating with a mask. It was black, wedge-shaped, clean, and chiseled like a dog. They were here to sell at a stall stationed in the area since the bazaar where Deathbringer and Sophia’s friends sold was also here.\nMoving on to the background, the conversations went on and on, and various personalities were clear from the first few sentences.\nIn the end, Witchman was happy to see such action even in such a tiny little workplace.\nAfter finishing his assessment, he continued onward to the adventurer guild where he SAW stacks of paper being thrown away on one side. They were cutting down on older and outdated documents about adventurer activities.\nWith how rare such information was, Witchman was quick to ask if he could view the papers, but the decline response he got was that the data there was sensitive and private.\nHe resumed walking to the quest board. After checking their various details, such as assumed levels of the monsters, he realized that he was checking the board by himself without having a party. So he went and confessed to the staff, adding that he had forgot.\nHowever, the staff told him that they intentionally allowed people to take quests indepedently, considering the new adventurers piling up after new policy changes promoted new adventurer entrants into adventuring. This was done as a response to the declining adventurer population after the King decided to have them participate in a significant engagement with Mawkery. Moreover, Mawkery was starting to influence the rate in which monsters spawned and attacked in the region by supplying them with equipment, apparatus, and supplies or displacing them toward attacking human settlements. This extended to humans as well, as the refugees would herd toward other settlements, pressing them. This could end up going violent in a cascading effect. Increased vigilance was decreed by the king in response to this. In the end, adventurers were needed to help in stabilizing the region.\nThis was the only thing he gleaned from conversations with friends, and even that was a summary of the whole picture. If he wanted to set the tone, he would require large amounts of investment.\nAfter taking on several easy quests, he helped gather everyone he knew to join him on a set up camp next to a reported monster hideout. It was sequestered in a dungeon, so they had to play by the traditional rules first before thinking of engaging in a targeted approach to lure out the monsters. Even with long-range, wide-reaching skills, the hideout was too well-defensible, so they had to wait it out and hopefully starve them. But many monsters didn’t need food and water, so they were hoping that the monsters came out sooner or later.\nAfter arriving at the place and defeating the weaker monsters standing around, they finally got the camp up and going, having a linear path to the city and many routes of escape. Moreover, they kept an eye on the path via the various vantage points nearby, using wards and sentries who were also duelists well equipped in prolonged one-on-one fights. They helped keep the enemy at bay and divert coming enemies’ attention by creating pressure on arriving enemy’s resources after they set up camp.\nAfter all their preparation, which was led by many of the senior adventurers of the group Witchman helped assemble, they took the time to share their reports of various fronts, quests, and events.\nWitchman learned that Michel was no longer struggling with her necrotic arm, but she said that it was because she could now safely control it with the help of a stream of healers. However, this was expensive, so her new goal involved getting out more. So she thanked him for the opportunity since he was the one who nominated her specifically.\nAs soon as Michel had their small talk, Sophia and Deathbringer were excited to deliver the news that they were finally getting married. It was not that important to Witchman initially, but they mentioned that because of this marriage, they were joining a healer guild. This specific healer guild required couples because at the event of marriage, both gained a buff that increased all healing received by 30 percent permanently.\nWitchman applauded them, saying that they should kiss. It was a deadpan gesture, but when they kissed, he clapped his hands even harder, laughing in good humor with the rest of the group.\nIt was an easygoing discussion.\nSoon, the more urgent news came.\nBrackern mentioned that there had been reports of hideouts increasing as of late, but he did say that it could mostly be a result of the increased adventurer independence. He was amazed that it was working, concluding that it was advisable for them to continue to support the new entrants.\nBrandon was not pleased, sharing that hundreds of adventurers lost their lives in a troll attack due to carelessness with a goblin-improvement system. This magical system involved the careful arrangement of hundreds of mages in an particular order in order to reach a certain magical requirement that significantly boosted goblin strength and intelligence. This was supposed to become the new start for the city, but it failed.\nEveryone else was aware, concluding that it was a good thing that a hundred was able to survive.\nChapter 23 - Paths Crossed and Bonds Strengthened linkDesmond Leroy, a young man suited to become a soldier, had already been preparing to play around the area where Witchman was. Furthermore, he came to learn from the guild that they were setting up camp, establishing a semi-permanent presence to address coordinated monster activity.\nHe decided to come along and help, hoping to aid in defeating the monstesr; however, he was most concerned about resources. Since he had been following public updates on Witchman and his party since the disastrous Mawkery engagement, he helped bring in some extra aid to let off pressure from them, as the area was flanked by several monster hotspots, specifically those galvanized around dungeon steps and other forms of infrastructure. Rather than being tied to the role of confinement, exploration, and storage, these dungeon steps provided a vantage point, being high steps that led to a quadrangle platform. This platform was where the adventurers often squared up for a fight.\nNow that Desmond and his party were present, Witchman, knowing his name, came to meet him.\n“What’s been happening recently with you?” Witchman said. He also wanted to add that he didn’t know they were friends in a joking manner, but he thought that he didn’t know Desmond well enough to say such a thing.\nDesmond was hasty to smile after he saw Sophia running up behind Witchman. “I didn’t know Rank 660 was with you,” he said.\n“You know my current rank?” Sophia said, her expression growing meek and her stride slowing as she approached the two.\n“I love watching the numbers. I’m currently Rank 760, so I’m not that far off.”\n“What’s that?” Witchman asked.\n“The rankings,” Sophia said before showing Desmond her thanks with bananas. It was a strangely timed gesture, but Desmond accepted it anyway, as the wagons carrying his support trolled past them.\nWitchman presumed that the rankings was a system regularly magically updated to keep competition among adventurers clear and rewarding, setting precedents for further improvement. The overall competitive sphere benefitted from this, and tournaments, although focused on specialized competitors, prisoners, and other diverse participants, contributed to its well-roundedness as a benchmark.\nDesmond’s presence was still unusual, as despite spending much of his time with people, Witchman didn’t spend that much time cultivating them. He was very on-and-off with his connections, which was also the reason why it was so awkward with the six adventurers. In the end, he had much more room for improvement when it came to sustaining his relationships. Ultimately, Desmond was acting proactively here in Witchman’s favor.\nAs the days passed, Witchman benefitted a lot from the free roaming porton of their camp set-up, advancing collaboration between the group in smaller, more intimate activities: maintenance, washing themselves and their clothes, patrolling, resting, training, creating fortifications, regular check-ins, updating situational reports, and relaying important information, guarding the sick, playing very intense outdoor games, sustaining a strict presence in the dungeon, and organizing and receiving resupplies of wards, torches, food, water, arrows, and other essential supplies, among other activities.\nAs soon as two weeks were over, Witchman was able to strengthen the bonds between the people he knew, significantly reducing hesitation and speeding up communication and group dynamics with regard to role swapping and other more complex maneuvers within a group. This was learned meaningfully and slowly through team-building activities, but it was most clear during fast-paced fights.\nSo they were much prepared, and Desmond’s third party aid shed some light on many glaring issues with their arrangement, making their camp life that much more fulfilling in preparing them for what lay ahead.\nIn the end, it was good to have outsource aid in order to streamline toward what was truly their forte.\nThe monsters soon came out in order to engage the adventurers, but because the adventurer camp was a good distance away, they didn’t hear or know. In fact, the adventurers that detected them, although discovered, waited until the monsters completely committed into leaving their hideout before using their relevant spells to escape.\nAt this point, the adventurers had caught them.\nThe monsters exploded in bits and pieces, as tens of skills slammed into them, burning them to the ground.\nWith the hideout emptied, the adventurers immediately rushed in to control it, finding that they didn’t have any form of active magical communication or connection with an external party. That meant they were isolated, but that also meant that their deaths didn’t secure the adventurers a line to Mawkery.\nWith conclusions like this, the adventurers already knew that they had spent so much resources to defeat an isolated enemy, potentially allowing other more coordinated enemy forces to take control of other objectives much easier with their absence.\nThis was not the victory they had planned.\nSo immediately, when they returned, they moved their attention over to the soldiers and the official army, wondering how they were doing without the adventurers.\nWitchman was the one most perturbed by this, as he was the one who had invited them all to target the hideout. Even if they won, his influence resulted in an overwhelming defeat due to mismanaged resources and manpower. However, he also felt that the King was not clear-cut with his goals and objectives, not informing them of the military activities within the region. So they could only make decisions based on poorly informed deduction alone.\nIn simpler terms, they did win by defeating the isolated enemy, but they spent too much resources to do so because the King withheld essential information and left certain routes very insecure so as to have false alarms enter through. The monsters and the hideout were not very crucial as an objective, and they could have spent the resources and manpower somewhere more pivotal.\nHowever, Witchman also didn’t press the issue to the King. If he was more assertive about it, he could have been given sufficient military briefing.\nHe addressed these concerns with the coalition and Desmond’s party.\nAs a result, without saying so explicitly, they effectively decided to put a pause on future collaborations for the time being.\nWitchman relegated his focus to more simple quests, having tired himself out from all the in-depth preparation.\nHe returned to the adventurer guild where he saw a large fence outside the city gate.\nHe saw two familiar beggars and asked them about dungeons. They shook their head, confused.\nHe looked around for a good ten minutes before he found a familar tall guy. He was the one who answered his question about dungeons before. So after waiting for the guy to finish a conversation with a group of mothers, he learned the location of the dungeons.\nSince he didn’t want to bother the guy any longer, he left abruptly since the guy started talking to someone else immediately after answering. He was a busy person, wearing civilian clothes.\nHe reached the dungeon and discovered several branching paths along the way, but he wasn’t dismayed. He was concerned about the lack of adventurers in the area, considering that it reminded him of the ambush location to which the golem maker had guided him.\nAs he was walking, he heard a group of adventurers walking by, their feet particularly silent. After he encountered them eye-to-eye, one of them said something strongly, and then he could suddenly hear their footsteps normally again.\nThe same person who had spoken strongly, a woman wearing crocodile green clothes that blended somewhat with the rainforest environment, said: “Good day, Sir. I haven’t seen anybody like you around here.” She was referring to his weird get-up of purple and yellow.\nWitchman didn’t know what to say since he thought his attire was normal. “I… don’t usually travel around here.”\n“Is that so?” said the woman, looking away and around as if she was searching for something.\nBehind her, the other members of her group resumed conversing casually after they realized that Witchman was a normal guy.\nWitchman noticed the woman’s wandering gaze and asked, “What was that magic with the quietness?”\nThe woman cringed, and it was clear that she didn’t want to tell him the name of the foot-quieting spell she had used. “It was… a particular magic. Can’t tell you. How about you? What are you here for? I smell something strange. Is that you?” She began sniffing around, wrinkling her nose.\nSince she was so adamant with her disgust, he presumed that it might not be any old fart.\nWitchman’s eyes widened. “What smell?”\nThe woman glanced at his eyes before she did a double take at him, reciprocating his seriousness. “Burning…”\nThe tone of the conversation behind her began to weaken, as they were beginning to sense the tension in the air.\n“Hmm… I don’t know,” Witchman said, his eyes relaxing, his voice suddenly weak halfway, coughing lightly. The air was humid, and he was getting thirsty. So he took out a pouch and drank, having ignored the thirst due to the group encounter. “Anyway…” His eyes stopped blinking. The smell of burning marked something new.\nWitchman stared at several plants, imagining their forms suddenly turning into monsters. He had imagined too many monsters in the dark during his time at the camp.\nNow that he was here in the morning, he hoped he was wrong about monsters roaming the day so casually and in a hidden way.\nMeanwhile, the woman and the group left, returning to the city gate.\nWitchman was the only one who really took the mention of burning seriously.\nWhen he finally reached a dungeon, he speedily arranged his things on the ground and located the orb, finding that it was not going to be easy to shatter it after banging it against the wall several times. This was one of his instinctive behaviors that he had to stop.\nThe goblins had began to accumulate, seeing him as a clear threat on their territory.\nBut Witchman knew a particular goblin, so he asked for the goblin’s name.\nThe goblins stopped and quickly ran off.\nWitchman saw one of them still lingering through the angled shadow.\nAs soon as he stood up and returned his items into his bag, the lingering goblin emerged, being the same goblin he had met.\nIts name was Finesse.\nWitchman said: “Hey, I was wondering if I could get some information about the area, the adventurers are not really helpful. And can I check your stats as well? I want to see how your [Vitality] looks like.” It was a polite gesture since he could see it without asking.\nFinesse gave a thumbs-up, making his way out of the dungeon as soon as Witchman gave him some space.\nOutside, Witchman showed him a bag of gold, saying that it could buy a sword around a certain size, using his hands to demonstrate the size.\nFinesse was smart, nodding twice. Moreover, it could talk, as all goblins could. “I didn’t know it was easy,” it said. “Please tell me about how to make gold.”\nWitchman shook his head. “No, it’s not that easy. It might be easier for me, but it’s not going to be easy for you.”\nFinesse repeated what Witchman said until he understood. “Okay.”\nWitchman wanted to assist goblins like Finesse, even if his previous quest about uniting goblins and humans was no longer active. He was hoping to keep his mind in a sane place by doing so, since the targeting of goblins was something he couldn’t stand by any longer. It was not right to him, and he had already reached that conclusion many times before. He just didn’t understand why yet, but soon enough, he realized that adventurers could never really understand until he showed them that goblins were more than monsters.\nHe wanted to create a world where he was everything he could ever be, and assisting goblins was only one stepping stone.\nChapter 24 - Goblin Connections and Adventurer Insights linkWitchman accepted the goblin, leading it to his cottage, but before that, he signed a magical contract with it.\nThe Agreement, effective January 1, 11000, was between Witchman (“Employer”) and Finesse (“Employee”). Finesse would serve as a General Assistant during adventures, doing tasks like carrying supplies and cooking. Payment was 10 Damian gold coins weekly, plus room and board. Finesse was on-call and joined adventures as needed. Work hours varied and would be communicated beforehand. The agreement lasted until terminated by either party with one day’s notice. Termination had to be in writing.\nThis was sufficiently formal for their purposes, as Witchman wanted to show how much he valued goblin connection. And it was the truth. If he could rope in a whole new network of activity beyond his current position as a human adventurer, then he would be bathing in gold in the form of information, connections, and all kinds of resources waiting to be pried into. He would not want to miss out on such amazing loot!\nIn the end, he knew just what he needed to excel—turning enemies into allies similar to how the adventurers had turned hobgoblins into friends. Instead of frustrating himself by tucking himself into a corner with adventurers and their incompatible views on goblin life, he knew that the best way to advance was to find a third path forward, one that made room for both adventurer activity and goblin life. This would result in significant gains in human and goblin capital moving forward.\nHis end goal was to justify his past series of hardships by launching new platforms for growth.\nHowever, this was his current plan and views. Even if he wanted to emancipate himself from this perceived moral disturbance, he would not be able to integrate these ideas and theories into reality that easily, considering his knowledge deficit as an immigrant.\nOne way to offset this deficit was by utilizing the [System] and its [Forums]. But its effect was largely marginal on his overall growth and understanding. He did get the orb, but he wasn’t necessarily understanding the world through text on a page. He needed firsthand experience more and more, and the only way to do that was to keep exploring and experiencing new things instead of hiding under the complicated system serving the adventurers.\nHis inauguration of goblin relations, especially as a former employee relations manager, was a step onward into firsthand experience.\nMoving on to addresal, three concerns entailed a significant weight in his growth: the mysterious mechanisms of the [System] with its levels, skills, and other functions, the distribution of various monster species and humans across the region, and the mechanisms of monster spawning, biology, and loot, among others.\nMany days earlier, he learned from a conversation with the 6 adventurers that levels could be exchanged for weapon, tool, and armor enchantments and repairs. But since then, he hadn’t spent a single level toward anything. Now he knew he didn’t have to rely on the [System] to handle everything, but maybe he could have been much more proactive about it in the last three months. Well, his situation was complex: taking things slow and focusing on building and leveraging relationships and connections made it easier for him to make better and more meaningful choices in the long game.\nToday, he was finally going to reap the harvest.\nHe went over to his levels.\nIncidentally, he realized that he hadn’t gotten a second skill yet. The [System]’s behavior felt arbitrary to him lately, especially when he revealed himself in a human form. It didn’t make it better when he discovered the [Forums]. That only deepened his suspicion that the [System] was inherently unreliable, capricious, fickle, turbulent, and volatile. That wasn’t a system. However, maybe, he was the one not understanding.\nAnyway, he wanted to pour his levels into a weapon. His current choice of weapon was a spear since it was the easiest to use and most flexible in a formation. However, he also enjoyed using swords, but he never used it in battle unless his side was so much more ahead. In the same way, his coolest moments were him stomping and kicking enemies, but again, he could only do that when nothing went wrong and everything went well in accordance to the well-oiled machine.\nIndeed, shifting to the topic of physique, he wasn’t that athlethic even after three months, at least compared to the adventurers. Specifically, likely due to genetics, he still had a noticeable belly; though, his arms and thighs were already showing pronounced muscle bulk. In contrast, the rest of his body were relatively weak. Particularly, his understrength calves and feet meant he hadn’t been making quick, tiptoed swerves and long, low leaps in the fights, leaving him vulnerable in a situation where that was essential. In the end, tactical skill and strategy could compensate for physical weaknesses to a certain extent, but sooner or later, he would have to address the issue of physique.\nHis plan in mind involved targeted training and nutrition, so he was hoping to include more vegetable dishes and fruits in his diet to start, since he was mainly relying on the adventurer diet, which focused on meats, hardtack-like bread, and root vegetables and excluded lighter vegetables, grains, and fruits due to reasons of calory density and longer shelf life. These reasons extended to availability. Naturally, there were exceptions to the diet, one of which being bananas.\nReturning to the leveling process, he immediately contacted several people he knew, particularly his friends from the Block \u0026 Bed Tavern: Thorne, Elara, and Lumi.\nAs soon as he saw them, he asked whether it was better to buy an enchanted weapon or pour one’s levels into an unenchanted one.\nThe answer he got ranged.\nThorne said: “For one, you can try pouring your levels into armor. That was safer since you’ll use it for longer. What I mean to say is that you will want to use it for longer given how much more expensive it is. And I’m not talking about gambisons or banana fiber armor. I’m talking about metal armor. Don’t use it yet. Save up for armor first. That’s probably cost you three months’ wage, and you’ve been here for three months. So you should have about enough, right?”\nElara said: “I don’t think leveling up anything is a good idea. Let me explain. What I want to do with my levels is to level up my skills, but that only comes once you reach level 100. Now, I’m not that strong, and I haven’t actually levelled up a single skill. But from what I’ve heard and seen, the skill upgrades are usually very good.”\nThorne agreed.\nLumi said: “We can try asking others. Maybe they know more about leveling. But you can just sink levels into your current weapons and armor bit by bit. Since they’ll need repairs, and the levels will be useful for that. It’s much more cheaper and safer that way for the long term.”\nThorne and Elara agreed.\nOverall, leveling armor, skills, and repairing equipment were alternative visions of what Witchman originally had in mind.\nHe asked them about the mechanisms of monster spawning even if he had asked that a similar question many times before; however, he had a more nuanced understanding now, leading to refined questions.\nHe asked whether goblins were capable of spawning more goblins.\nThorne said: “No, that depends on whether you’ve hit them, and they’re not capable of magically spawning some, but there have been occasions of goblins spawning goblins as reinforcements. It might not be a conscious choice on their side. Also, I’m not sure how it actually works, but it has been used many times before to get some extra loot in for beginners.”\nElara and Lumi agreed.\nWitchman asked whether goblins could use magic as well as humans could and whether they could use magic that impacted their rate of spawning.\nElara said: “The magic they use is often rudimentary, and you’ve seen it yourself. Goblins who do use more developed magic was deeper in the dungeon or farther in more complex goblin societies. Recently spawned in goblins are usually like confused babies, so it is the goal of adventurers to keep them scattered and divided by camping near monster spawn areas and culling their numbers to prevent excess. As for your question about magic that impacts spawn rate, it exists, but whether goblins have it is unknown. And this kind of magic is very unique and hard to find. It would be a secret artifact and not any spell that anyone can use.”\nWitchman nodded, preparing himself to ask more questions. As soon as he addressed everything, he would begin to make arrangements to conquer territory and establish his presence here. The King would notice him, but as long as he could convince others that he was worth listening to, he would vastly improve his influence and wield it accordingly.\nThis was all just one big pie.\nLumi added to Elara’s explanation: “We have seen many artifacts. We can show you, but you have to realize that it’s not that crazy or important. It’s aged artifacts that have grown weaker overtime. Their original purpose and quality is now gone. But if you want, you can take a look. I have one right not that I use for my hair. It used to be used to heavily increase a person’s magical power by 35% of the total, but now, that effect is dead or dormant I hope. One of our long goals is seeing whether certain dungeons are hiding some form of magical artifact that could influence other artifacts to activate. Even the King stated once that if we find an artifact capable of destroying cities, he would not hesitate to use it against the monsters.”\nLater, Witchman made his way down a cellar, finding several different fences used as railings all around the flight of stairs. The ground was quadrangle outlines of stone bricks, and the ceiling had this dusty look, as if this place had lain untouched for 30 years. As soon as they reached the bottom floor, Lumi, with her firm gambison and gorgeous smile, showed him various lamps floating in the room. “This is another artifact,” he said, “but it isn’t that special. I know you’ve been confused for a long time, but why? Artifacts are a common thing here in this region. No matter how ignorant your previous culture could be, it should not be so ignorant so as to not know artifacts at all. Your confused expression says it all. You came from a whole different world.”\nWitchman was not paying attention, and he was not worried at all by the Lumi’s phrasing. Time had already showed him that he was different and that no one actually knew where he came from. The [System] could change things, especially with the [Forum] hinting that there were others like him out there.\nHe didn’t want to linger about in thought. The dimly orange-lit room already drew his attention enough.\nChapter 25 - The Depths of Desperation linkSeveral goblins walked up to Witchman’s cottage, waiting for him. They were hoping to see him before they got demotivated. They wanted to be a part of his group along with the goblin Witchman had contracted.\nMeanwhile, Witchman kept pace with Lumi’s growing confidence as she spoke about artifacts.\nHis entangling presence, like webs scavenging succulently around the room, seeking out the flesh and souls of every inhabit and the regions they inhabit, occupied the room.\nThe room sounded soft like whispers in the dark tearing through the air and highlighting each flaw in cadence.\nThe movements of Lumi, Thorne, and Elara could be likened to the caring and heartsome feelings of a giantess forming a circle in which they would birth their children.\nIn here, Matthew’s grace was alive, his mind crafting various thoughts and plans upon each other in piles aiming for the top.\nThis was his presence among children of this world: the three could only help with small words.\nThe artifacts came out as tiny toys in a grandiose world.\n“So, do you want to try this?” Lumi repeated, showing him a small artifact weighing as much as a woman when its openings were closed tight. “This decreases movement slowing effects by 25%.” The artifact was shaped like an almond, and it looked like a giant nut. When Lumi handed it to Witchman, she covered its openings. It fell from their hands immediately, but at the same time, since the holes were not covered, it became light again, surprising Witchman.\nThe room was strangely cold.\n“What’s this for?” he said, huffing briefly, his voice squeaky like a dolphin catching its breath. “I haven’t seen anything like this.”\nThe three inn regulars knew that Witchman had an artifact.\nWitchman smiled. “Well, thanks for showing me. I need to continue my mission.”\nThey also knew that Witchman hadn’t talked to anyone for a while since his failure at the hideout engagement.\nSince Witchman wasn’t saying anything about it, they addressed it. “Hey, we were hoping you’d tell us about it.”\nWitchman’s smile weakened before he frowned. “I’m trying to manage… It’s been a while, and I’m still experimenting. I’ve tried contacting goblins recently and seeing how I can enslave them…” He didn’t like the sound of “enslave” now that he said it. After he saw their concerned looks, he responded: “I haven’t forgotten what it felt like to be tortured by the goblins. I’m just taking my time, okay? I’m not really hoping to sit still for too long after what happened. I still feel bad about it, okay? You think I live for myself only? No, I try to… live for others too… or pleasing them… No, that’s not it…”\nThorne smiled sheepishly. “We’ve been talking about you, and we heard that you weren’t okay since then. You haven’t talked to anyone…”\n“Yeah.” Witchman shook his head out of embarassment.\n“I haven’t seen you this frail… and weak,” Lumi said.\nShe was the type to be assertive about this. Witchman wasn’t offended in the slightest. In fact, he was relieved. “Yeah…” He said, his tone a little lighter.\n“And you haven’t been eating with us and Shadrach, Aidan, and Andrei…”\n“Yeah…”\n“James Markus and James James too.”\n“Yeah…”\n“I apologize…” He didn’t want to bother them too much. He was already making progress. He just had to leave this place, and he could be alone finally. But part of him knew that his own mental state relied on people. He wasn’t a lone island. He could only cope so much before everything fell to ruins. If he dared speak a word against them, they would only turn it into an opportunity to comfort him. He didn’t want that. He was tired of being complacent and comfortable. He hadn’t been making progress, and he would rather an enemy than a friend speak with him. This way, he could never find himself ever looking down at his own feet in contentment. He didn’t want to lose that touch of frustration—that gaping well.\n“I’m sorry,” he said with strength, internally admitting that nothing he could do would ever suffice.\n“We’re sorry too… but you have to know that this is the last time we’ll be seeing each other right? We’re heading already. Traveling to the Hittites.”\n“Have you seen them already?”\n“No, but we contacted some of them. We should be able to take a safer route this time. No worries.”\n“Ah, okay. I was just concerned…”\nAfter their discussion, Witchman left, not feeling a tiny bit satisfied. But that was life. Every conversation ended before that feeling of satisfaction, and every goal was finished before he had time to say okay. Everything happened out of schedule, never submitting to his will. All he could do was match its pace and do away with preparation when the time came. Adaptation and flexibility, that is.\nHis connections were always deep here, but fleeting and overwhelming, tying him down and helping him explore. They were never to be underestimated, always attempting to take over him and turn him into something worse or greater.\nHe left.\nNot looking back.\nThe windows were a little higher than normal.\nMaybe, he felt low and small.\nHe ran, bursting in a dash, remembering the dream-like dash he made when he was escaping the first goblins he saw in this world.\nPain didn’t make him stronger. It only made him more sensitive.\nBut he did learn skills to cope along the way.\nIn the end, he could only disappear.\nHe fled out of the city.\nHe was ashamed.\nHe gritted his teeth and burst in anger.\nNothing he did made sense, and he would always come to this conclusion.\nHis emotions were running high again, and his intellect was never useful because it never matched reality.\nOnce he prepared with all his will, his emotional intelligence was the first to fall because nothing went according to plan. Even with flexibility in mind, it all failed. It all succumbed to devastation and deterioration. His memories did.\nHe was an afterimage of his past self.\nHe fell to the earth and slammed his fists against the earth, reddening, growling inwardly, huffing like he was drowning inside his throat. He gurgled, slipping to the earth, his eyes reddening with the liquid form of his hurt.\nHe never found himself relieved, always frustrated, always suffering.\nHe wanted to become arrogant.\nSo he demanded this to be reality.\nHe needed to become a psychopathic. How else could he cope?\nHow else could he cope when he saw a goblin being slaughtered right in front of him?\nHow else could he cope when he saw adventurers lose their lives? The memories coming back to haunt him.\nThe time was out of sync because his mind was out of sync.\nHow much time had passed? 3 months? But wasn’t he just with his family and friends? When? Where? When?\nHe was 15 minutes away from home. He should be. His apartment was there behind the bend. He had to walk a little because the tricycles and jeepneys didn’t reach his house. In truth, he didn’t want to take the tricycles because it was expensive. His cousin liked to do that though whenever he slept over at his house.\nNow, he was reminiscing.\nNo, he couldn’t.\nHe had never done that.\nOver 90 days of torture.\nHe couldn’t bear it anymore.\nEveryone would say there was something wrong with him for hiding and suppressing this all this time.\nBut he had to.\nHe had to numb it all away.\nHe couldn’t be weak. He had to be strong.\nHe had to do something, so he couldn’t be weak and depressed.\nHe couldn’t lie down for hours everyday. He couldn’t do that.\nHe had to move his body.\nHe had to get out of the inn bed.\nHe had to.\nHe couldn’t be weak forever.\nEverything he did was for a higher purpose. It was never to help him cope.\nSo even he was doing something that was supposed to comfort him, it didn’t because he saw it as just another step toward becoming impenetrable and invulnerable.\nHis arrogance was just another front.\nHe cared about others, but he didn’t want to feel so emotional and vulnerable because it was too painful. He didn’t want to show them that he cared.\nHe didn’t want to be human.\nHe wanted to become the epitome of grace and beauty.\nThat very epitome.\nHe had to become perfection.\nNo more pain.\nNo more gritted teeth, tears wetting his chin, hoarse voice.\nHe would become everything.\nHe stood up with a few clumsy jerks. His footsteps were irregular.\nHe almost tripped, but that was partly intentional. He wanted to fall apart if that allowed him to be normal again.\nHe didn’t want to be special.\nHe went deep into the forest, wishing to end this madness, this stupidity, this lie.\nHe saw a goblin. Several of them.\nHe was back home at the cottage.\nHe grabbed a spear and ran.\nHe stabbed them ragefully, sorrowfully, and angrily again. He skewered them to stillness.\nThere, he felt validated.\nHe was the instrument. He followed orders. He did the right thing. He made others happy.\nSo much encouragement from his fellow adventurers just to do something so simple.\nHe smiled.\nHe trembled and had a panic attack, screaming at a high pitch and growling as if he was being tortured physically.\n“No! No! No!”\nThe [System] appeared, disgusted. “You should be better than this. You’re not satisfying the expectations of the gods.” He beat Witchman again and again until he became terrified like a little boy.\n“You have to become…”\nWitchman began screaming again and backing away, covering his head.\nThe [System] cringed. “Seriously. What’s this?” He cast a spell that numbed Witchman’s emotions with a drug-like effect.\nFor the remainder of the time the [System] watched, Witchman stared in silence, sitting up, his gaze unfocused.\nThe [System] retched. “Here’s what I’ll do. You’re too ugly to look at. You make me sick. I’m going to…”\nWhen he saw the lack of response from Witchman, he hesitated. “Like I was saying… you will receive a blessing from the Overlord. He’s hoping you can get out of this little tantrum of yours and just move…” He tilted his head, checking for any movement from Witchman. “…on.”\n15 minutes after the [System] left, he received a status notification.\n[You have the Overlord’s blessing. Your health stat will cost 300% less for each stat point, decreasing to 0.89 per stat point from 2.67 per stat point!]\nWitchman began to laugh again similar to how he was manically laughing earlier out of madness. But this time, a sense of confidence swelled up. He was back in control.\nEven if he was mentally unstable, he knew an opportunity when he saw it. He realized that he now viewed his mental breakdown as a way to rope in support from the Overlord and the [System]. With this new vision in mind, he stood and pressed onward, looking at his two titles again and his new third one.\n[The Goblin Slayer title boosts all damage dealt to goblins by 12%.]\n[The Skeleton Slayer title boosts all damage dealt to skeletons by 12%.]\n[The Overlord’s Gifted title boosts decreases the cost of the health stat by 300% for each stat point]\nHe was going to grind and level up. It was only 1 xp for 1 goblin or 1 skeleton. But he hoped to trigger the [System], trusting that it rewarded solo leveling.\nChapter 26 - Goblin Dispatch and Reflections: Paths to Progression linkSeeing his first goblin, he hesitated, seeing his future in front of him—a mass murderer, a grave-maker, a taunter of his friends who wished only for him to be that shy, innocent, and kind child again.\nHe smiled with disdain.\nWith the goblin prepared, as Witchman ran, he adjusted his aim and gutted it on the neck, moving his breathing with precision.\nImpressive takedown! You’ve just scored a solid 7+ XP for that solo victory! 🎉\nHe looked for another one and immediately pierced it on the same spot. He was becoming more adamant. He was charging them one by one and catching them off guard with how fast he angled and shifted the starting point of his spear thrusts. His arm muscles progressively gloated.\nNicely done on that solo goblin takedown! Your skill earns you a cool 7+ XP! 🎉\nHe lacerated a single armored goblin three times consecutively, breaking its restarting momentum the same number of times.\nGreat job defeating that armored goblin! You’ve earned yourself 42+ XP for your triumph! 🎉\nSeveral goblins appeared, trying to slow him down with their arrows.\nBut he was too quick, impaling them with the same spear.\nHe didn’t even switch his tactics.\nThe goblins were solo-killed one by one, not ever being able to relay the reinforcements the need to be more careful than normal: Witchman’s damage was deceptively high.\n7 more goblins came his way, but his confidence had grown: he skewered, transfixed, slaughtered, eviscerated, and ravaged them.\n10 goblins in total were dispatched, and his [Whirlwind Waltz] was used.\nGreat job defeating 3 armored goblins by yourself speedily! You’ve earned yourself 189+ XP for your triumph! 🎉 50% bonus XP due to speed!\nGreat job defeating 4 goblins by yourself quickly! You’ve earned yourself 42+ XP for your triumph! 🎉 50% bonus XP due to speed!\nHe celebrated the win.\nName: Matthew Cruz\nLevel: 42 -\u003e 43\nCurrent experience: 105\nSpecies: Human\nAge: 25\nSkills: [Whirlwind Waltz]\nSpells: None / None\nVitality: 15\nQuests: [Bridge of Knowledge]\nTitles: [Goblin Slayer], [Skeleton Slayer], [Overlord’s Gifted]\nUnused stat points: 86\nAfterwards, he visited a familiar golem, the one he had first met in this world, wondering how golems were used.\nSince he came to Rodney’s team to ask, he was immediately informed that golems were a special population purposed as an “energy hub network.”\nHe might have spent months learning, but he didn’t necessarily understand the world. It was all disconnected pieces of information to him, and the only way he could understand them was by experiencing a wide range of everyday experiences firsthand over an sustained, extended period. This was why the last three months mattered, even if much of it was tumultuous.\nIn the end, he didn’t gain much, but he did try to secure the opportunities available to him.\nThough, unbeknownst to him, one of his many missed opportunities was not getting the artifact that Lumi showed him earlier.\nUltimately, he took advantage of the opportunity to dispatch goblins while they were still sure they could handle a solo adventurer.\nAnyway, Rodney’s team tried to explain the concept of golems, but he didn’t understand much. He realized that mind was not connecting the dots, so he said that he was probably a little tired.\nHe went to bed and fell asleep, his heart still beating tangibly. His high levels of stress were partly due to a lack of sleep.\nLater, he woke up, still lacking sleep.\nMeanwhile, at his most frequented guild, many adventurers were making noise, as various news circulated.\n“The quest [Hobgoblin Menace] is confirmed by thousands of soldiers! Even if it took three months, he’s finally dead! Stability was now returning to the region!”\nMoreover, smaller but important news also came to their notice: “Tulips and Barkada Forces are beginning to dwindle. It is probably time for some dungeon clean-up. We’ve already contacted a coalition of adventurer parties making their way down to the Fourth Ring. Hardly anyone has forgotten potions this time, considering the strengthening Smog in the place. We can safely say that the region around that area is safe. But please don’t forget that with dwindling, we are continuing the monitor the area for goblin activity. If you or anyone has seen a goblin, please activate your red cards.”\nWhen Witchman finally arrived, he got wind of the circulating info, and he already understood the context behind them.\n“Tulips and Barkada Forces” were a particular band of outlaws that had begun to cover various fishing ponds and other beginner areas, preventing beginners from diving into fights with spawning goblins there due to the band’s efficient pathing within a beginner division area. They were the ones Witchman dispatched earlier.\nThe “Fourth Ring” was a particular monster spawning hot spot unique to the one of the major dungeons in the area, and it was notorious for carrying the highest death rate among a particular rank of adventurers. As for the reason of this, its terrain was deceptively deadly with many adventurers falling prey to blind spots and check points even with light sources. The monsters were also active in destroying any form of light since that prevented spawning, so that emphasized the territorial struggle. As for the rank of the most victimized adventurers there, they were “Silver”. To explain, the adventurers were ranked from Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Emerald, Diamond, Masters, Grandmaster, and Challenger.\nWith that said, Witchman was only Iron at the moment, having fought with higher-ranked and veteran adventurers for all his quests, except for his new recent advancement into solo leveling against the goblins.\nIn any case, Smog was a particular effect that carried various negative effects on humans in an area, especially in a dungeon. Sometimes, it slowed down movement; other times, it weakened damage dealt.\nAs for the red cards, they were an magical innovation produced by a particular department residing in the adventurer guild building. Simply, triggering it alerted the guild operations.\nReturning to reality, Witchman tried to remember his goblin fight earlier. He knew well that it wasn’t just a fight sustained in a vacuum. He noted various objectives based on the different piles of resources laid out in the area.\nThere were fruits, specifically “dalandan,” or sweet oranges, and from what he knew, these were a part of the typical goblin diet. But he knew that knowing diet preferences only had so much weight. What he focused on was their pattern of transportation. They were able to deliver so much fruits into a particular part of the rainforest. He wondered what was going on there.\nAfter he went to Rodney’s information team to ask about it, he learned that they already knew about the goblins and their pattern of transportation and that it was better for him not to worry about it. They said that it was much more efficient for him to take quests from the board and leave those kinds of challenges to intelligence units like them.\nWitchman was blocked again, first time about the golems, the second time about the goblins and their pattern of transporataton. Though, they did try to explain the golems. He was just tired yesterday, so he asked about it.\nAs mentioned earlier, he was still tired. But he did learn now that the golems had a fascinating cultural history. The concept of the golem was first pioneered by multiple inventors and contributors in the 6th millennium. But it was only in the 7th millennium that they became wide-spread. As millennia passed, they gradually fell out of use, replaced by more efficient forms of magic. Today, they were largely considered obsolete, only collected by niche collectors and enthusiasts. However, when it came to the golems in this town, they were very much alive and breathing due to magical “imprints” that had been laid down for this particular town at its establishment, giving these golems boosts that made their presence valuable in the community in the form of town-wide buffs to mana regeneration and more. However, even then, it was limited to the adventurer guild, and recently, there were talks of removing golems to make way for new magic tech. The imprints and various magical technologies utilized in the town’s founding were growing outdated. These could be likened to software and hardware.\nIn the end, Witchman already had many things needed to start a city-wide presence. All he had to do was persist in his solo adventuring. Then, he could incorporate other various activities such as enchantment testing, stat experimentation, and the remodeling of his pattern of attack with respect to his overall arsenal with skills, spells, and all, for well-roundedness.\nAt the moment, he was going to visit Michel and the rest of the members of the first adventurer party. He wanted to understand first those who had died and why they died. His goal was to reset things and start off from a new layer of clean slate. If he could grasp the elements making up these individuals that he knew so well, then he could redesign his first adventurer group inheriting the former members.\nHe had to continue to beat back against his previous expected failed attempts if he wanted to kickstart a launchpad. False starts, numerous false starts.\nMoving on to the action, he visited Michel and accompanied her on a trip to the border again. She took advantage of his visit by going to the border again.\n“Where are the others?” she asked, knowing what the determined look on Witchman’s face meant.\nWitchman informed her that he would be trying to erect some way for them to advance. Even if they were low-ranked, with their recipes of success, it would a piece of cake for them to blitzkrieg their way to the top.\nHe met Deathbringer and Sophia, handing them gifts. He was surprised by how fast they adjusted to home life, but it wasn’t as if he knew them outside of adventuring anyway.\nDeathbringer said that he would be busy soon, and Sophia said that she could help. But she could only provide backup as long as it only involved tasks within the town.\nWitchman nodded, positioning Sophia in the “Utility” box in his mental map and tossing Deathbringer on the pile of character figures representing Michel and many others that he knew. This pile was in the “Combat” box.\nHe already had proven that fighting was not that difficult. All he needed to do was prepare himself for when his enemies were much more careful and cunning.\nWhen he contacted the other adventurers, including Brackern, Tamer, Ada, Kairo, Echo, Ella, Nova, Marcher, Rodney, Brandon, Marsh Cranberry, Desmond Leroy, the six adventurers, Thorne, Elara, and Lumi, he immediately assembled a meeting. This was only possible because the guild rewarded his solo leveling engagement with the goblins by announcing it. This was pivotal in making this meeting possible.\nAt the meeting, he suddenly cast a glance at Lumi, asking her if she still had that artifact. She said that she sold it yesterday because she was preparing to leave.\nMeanwhile, several adventurer parties joined the meeting from a recommendation by the six adventurers.\nThey already knew about Witchman’s strategic failure the last time, but they were sure that whatever he had prepared was likely going to be very rewarding. Desmond Leroy was crucial in convincing them to stop their mild heckling, since he was the third party most disadvantaged in that strategic failure.\nWitchman smiled with a sense of superiority, but acccompanied by a childish guffaw.\nChapter 27 - Coastal Confrontation: Clash of Worlds linkIn another place, far outside the city, a community of goblins were in the middle of attaching several houses together. “Guys, we’re in a hurry, but please commit to schedule. There hasn’t been a single mishap thus far, so be prepared. Human energies are upon us, and any gap in attention will be rewarded with death!”\nTheir voices reflected their cursory and prodding nature, childish yet almost lacking in that cadence usually reminiscent of humankind. But it was smooth like berries jumbled up in a space.\nThe community was situated on a coastal area, as hundreds of trees were being targeted for felling. They needed space, because adventurers would be passing by here.\nAs for why they were operating here, they wanted to ensure that their routes were still protected, so they needed to continue to build various hiding spots in case humans arrived. It wasn’t invulnerable or impenetrable, but it saved goblin lives.\nThey built various foxtrots all around and attached several inconspicuous hooks on the ladders to make it easier to climb the palm trees where they could hide.\nMoreover, they moved further up to a vantage point observing a lagoon adjacent to the wide coastal path. Here, they laid down a variety of stones and other resources tucked under leaves, bushes, and roped together and hung inside the leaves of a palm tree.\nThese were their many strategies for coherence across a wide network of goblin traffic, having lived here for centuries but displaced due to human activity—the age-old story.\nHumans arrived, and Witchman was among them.\nThey were excited at the prospect of forging control of the coastal areas, because travel and trade were still limited in these areas. Any attempt at an improved purview resulted in frustration, provided that they were most vulnerable to typhoons. They were also vulnerable to attacks from inland areas, thanks to being hemmed in by the sea. In the end, these areas were strategically valuable because they projected into the sea, serving as a bridgehead loosening up land and sea routes with one that basically surrounded the entire island group.\nFor context, the place where Witchman was located was an island spanning 150,000 square kilometers in area.\nEven here, Witchman’s influence was negligible, as he had only been participating in a tiny fabric of society back there in the city. If he wanted to play a larger role, he would need to continue developing his growth-oriented mindset.\nUltimately, despite his invisible pressure on the map, he was farming knowledge, experience, levels, and units, intending to scale for late game.\nWitchman adopted a new friend—Michel stood brazen, her gaze as unshaken as ever.\nBut this time, her expression was gloating, knowing that with her improved standing alongside Witchman and his associates, any attempt at dismantling her necrotic energy socio-politically would not prosper. In the end, the supporters of her necrotic power were plenty in the city. It was just that she was often blocked from adventurer parties and coalition lists due to it. But now, with a party protecting her, her less desirable sides were freed up, more so psychologically than actually.\nWith that said, she prepared herself, as her powers were highly team-oriented.\nAnd her thirst for goblin blood that used to be a source of conflict between her and Witchman became an emblem behind encroaching further into goblin land.\nBut this was not going to be easy.\nMany attempts at culling goblins to reduce them had the opposite effect—spread of goblins due to being scared off into relocating, resulting in higher birth rates. This meant a goblin community might already be on its way to birthrate stability by the time a goblin hotspot was identified and the local goblins were killed, causing the birthrate to destabilize. To explain, similar to some species of primates, goblins were serial monogamists. So they didn’t make more children with the same goblin. That was why when they went to new communities, they made more children. Moreover, goblins matured much faster than humans, which was why they were often described as “infestive creatures.”\nMeanwhile, the goblins waited, hundreds of goblins hiding peacefully around the area Witchman and his buddies walked through.\n“Eyes up,” Deathbringer said, holding a dark sword with fire emanating from it, his form gigantic due to a skill that increased muscle mass temporarily. He used it early to spin-charge the first enemy he found. It was also a cheap skill, being very strong for situations like these.\nHe was struck with a spear.\nThe spear was laced with venomous, frustrating Deathbringer’s burst of energy.\nHe fell to the ground, groaning.\nAs for the others, they were quick to dismantle the attacker into dozens of pieces, shining a highlight upon their event of death.\nChuckles and bursts of nervousness-tinted guffaws danced along the ley lines of this environment.\nThe sooner they dashed, the sooner the goblins enumerated their forces, looking upon each other each marked by a glorious gaze. The men would scatter, and the goblins would understand their place among the city lands.\nThe sky became heat with reddish marks, as a skill from one of the goblins summoned a spectral dragon that burned the area in a long line, leaving behind a wall of flame.\nThis stalled the rageful charge of the humans, so he counted the timer, since he was also preparing himself for a moment of magical stasis, one that produced hundreds of bats. This was another skill he was gifted by the gods, one that allowed him to become as quick as a bat while producing numerous bats simultaneously.\nHe hopped in place, preparing to move. He wasn’t at all dissuaded against wasting physical energy, since he had to be in his optimal state to execute his magic—a psychological mechanism involved.\nThe humans fled, Witchman following them, as the wall of flame fell, marking the introduction of an armored hobgoblin wielding hundreds of bats at his command. He raised the right hand in an ominous gesture, flying with the helpful wings of the bats.\nHe shot down arrows clumsily.\nMeanwhile, the rest of the goblins ran away, watching the humans spitting flames of fire, casting magical zooming attacks, and preparing to slash the nearest goblins. They were in a state of frenzy, moving progressively faster.\nThe goblins made a shield formation, casting magical shields along a line.\nThe humans stopped, using their poking abilities to keep the goblins preparing to catch them off guard at a distance.\nThe goblins and humans went back and forth.\nIn the meantime, Witchman waited before, according to plan, launched with the help of movement speed buffs from the artifact that Lumi had. She had bought it again after he insisted on paying her double for it. With the right money and haste, many things were possible.\nHe dashed, using his [Whirlwind Waltz] to stun the goblins that happened to align next to each other. This was a successive stunning, crafting the best opportunity for the adventurers to loom over and become bombardments upon them.\nThe goblins were quickly dismantled one by one, as several goblins tried unsuccessfully to engage the enemies. But it was too late. They malpositioned, and any more attacks, even if they showed significant prowess and dealt worrying damage, failed to dispatch key targets among the adventurers.\nThe long-range archers were quick, drawing arrows that took so much muscle to pull, and blasting them at the goblins with astounding power and speed.\nThe impact was explosive, turning goblin stiffness to fleshly decapitations of life.\nThey were assaulted from various sides, flying men turning their feeble shadow-accompanied forms to dust.\nMagical bursts of light emerged, symbolizing the end of the fight.\nTanks roamed around, archers took their position, and various melee warriors looked at the canopies of the rainforest. They didn’t feel too bothered by the predicament, even if not all of them were able to do optimally.\nThe goblins were finished off due to weak positioning and due to excessive focus on taking this particular objective—the lagoon.\nTheir preparation was offset by more significant objectives further down the coastal path.\nThe humans put down magical artifacts that levelled up the land gradually. These were basic aspects of maintaining control. The more level the land, the more easier it was for them to create a clear space.\nIt was mostly for aesthetic, but it did have a slight impact on the land.\nThey could have just used the road to set up camp, but they didn’t.\nAnyway, most of them left, leaving behind a large enough group of adventurers to scout the area. They were in a hurry to connect the city to this area.\nEven with the war going on, the best defence was offence.\nSo with the same principles the adventurers who had befriended the hobgoblins took, they made a small place. Although it ultimately failed to bring in trade since the focus of the city lay elsewhere, it was still a good military exercise.\nWitchman returned to the city, praying that he didn’t have to do that again. He was aghast since that situation reminded him of his first time in this world when the goblins chased him. Even now, he was reliving those past moments as if they were present-day and present-time.\nAnyway, an outpost group from the goblin community immediately reconnected and reinhabited the coastal areas, miffed that the humans did war for sport rather than practicality.\nLater, back at the city cafe, Witchman laughed at the idea that he had forgotten to bring food for himself, being the only way without extra food. Everyone brought personal food along with group food since they didn’t want to monopolize the shares. It was part of their culture to do this. But Witchman, coming from a different culture, didn’t really care. He just laughed at the idea that even with all his experience, he could still be considered an ignoramus to this place—the goblins, the murder, the murder, the murder.\nHe returned to his inn, staring at the orb that he used earlier in the fight. “Without this, I would have died.” He let out a guffaw, relief swelling in his veins, his heart pulsating, and his head beginning to grow light. He was not here to have a mental breakdown. He just wanted a time to think.\nHe looked again at the various instances of progression throughout the street, seeing the several new golem constructs in the area. The road was also cleaner, as more buildings were being renovated for goblin slave selling.\nHis former workplace when he was an employee relations manager was not here, but the forlorn expressions of one of the various vendors did remind him of the employees he had to deal with. It wasn’t too troublesome, but he did feel that it was better for him now that he would be struggling to make ends meet if he let go of his ambitions. These ambitions involved fighting.\nHe wasn’t a fighter, but for some reason, he was thoroughly convinced that this had been the way he was since the beginning. It was his destiny to have gone through everything to be here in the first place.\nMaybe, that allowed him to cope, but he didn’t know exactly.\nHe just had a strong feeling.\nHe went to the dungeons, as he spent his 88.31 unspent points in health, gaining 99 health and leaving behind 0.2 unspent points. Overall, he had 906 health now. He didn’t spend the points earlier in the fight out of impulsivity, thanks to how much support he got recently, which gave him little time to manage his emotions.\nAt the dungeons, watching several goblins compiling lists in order to make it easier for the living core of the dungeon to understand what was next in the priority list. These goblins functioned independently from the rest of the goblins, having developed a personal connection to this core in a mutual relationship.\nBut Witchman did not discriminate, his taut smirk emerging and exiting like a maniac.\nChapter 28 - A Dark Decree and the Burden of Names linkFar away, at a higher place, where the wind met the plains flanked by hillsides, which hinted at mountains further in the distance, figures of goblins walked in a line, interspaced by long spans of distance, which were far enough to express a collective sense of control over the environment, but short enough to be only a dash away.\nThe air was wild and flourishing, taking poise among the goblin figures where street lamps lit the path. These lamps were expensive, but with the help of the goblins’ energy, they were powered. This was not actually effective, but it served as a symbol of human cultural superiority. It was pragmatic to keep humans in the lane of glory while goblins outside the order of life into the stait of darkness.\nThis was the crucial definition provided by the city and its history—a complex interplay of love, adoration, and greatness. This was its pinnacle of authority, sovereignty, definite and perfected beyond order, only breakable by the limitations imposed by Nature and those other sovereigns that denied it.\nHere, the goblins took strides, their voices calm and wavy like sea far off the horizon in the astral planes beyond the flat plains. This was where the sea fell to the depths of space. Behind these goblins, a group of adventurers, whom Witchman knew, bickered like little daisies awaiting a presidential order. About the coming storm, It was going to make things difficult later on, but this could be pleasant if given the magical energies they prepared—skills that could mitigate its negative effects for them to see the beauty beyond the shade in the limelight of wet droplets of life.\nWithin the goblins’ sights, the human Witchman stared, his voice like a croak, his eyes like those who had seen God, his lips growing weary and chapped, his stomach aching, his mind breaking under the thunderous roars of guilt. He saw that he was capable of violence, and he detested it, despising power for all its evil.\nBut his words were: “I deserve this. Give it to me!”\nHis weapons were swift, aligning with the goblin forms. In the darkness… no… in the light, greatness was given formation.\nHe slashed through them, his weapon like a pie prepared for storm. He bladed (turned them to slice parts) them to river ale that was red and beating and pulsating like fiery chasms within the taste of spicy milk. He burned their faces with his glorious power, slicing off the tulip—the spine—that made up their body. It burned under a radiant light. He felled them apart, falling through with his actions until daylight spread its last breath where the night with its gloomy core memories budded like leaves in the shed holding a coming feast.\nHis weapons were swift, separating each facet from each other, as hundreds of slices of bread-like flesh dissipated like dust in the swallow’s breeze. The rendering of their forms as formless became its cherry on top.\nHe reddened them, lighting atop their head a candle of death, breezily swallowing the stray paint that detached from their canvas body as an offering to entrenched waters that represented his inherent right to power. This was his bountiful fresh river rain.\nTruncating their faces in a rivery slash, he moved farther beyond their shadow, claiming the land upon their bodies filled with hair and green shades. He rode the wave of the blade, his hands moving like fresh springs juicy to the throat. He punched, creating impacts that reminded him of death.\nDeath was his friend.\n“Gah!” he bawled; the bodies dropping to the ground, all goblins.\nThe smell of fresh water distracted him. The red amid a river of blood. The red here was the succinct theme of the [System], as he descended in levitation toward the new man Witchman.\n“Witchman,” said the voice of the [System]. It was different, one filled with awe, one filled with wonder. The glory of Witchman’s reign started here in this massacre.\n“You are valid. You are validated. You are deserving of this power you now wield.”\nWitchman thought he heard wrong, but he was sure it was all right. “Thank you. I don’t see myself doing this very often.” He wiped his tears, experiencing euphoria of violence, one rooted in mental deterioration and confusion regarding the definition of love. He was problematic.\nHe was glorious!\nOn the [System]’s prompting—he shouted to the heavens, “The Heavens have bestowed to me a power, and I will use it.”\nHe and the [System] laughed, their voices like apple swathed in feathery cotton, one pressed yet subtly refined in its puff (pastry case).\nThe night graded from purplish red to reddish green due to certain magical whispers in the atmosphere.\nWitchman smiled. He knew he was finally home.\nAt a new town called “Greenfield”, a relatively short distance away the camp where the hobgoblin-human alliance had been established, hundreds of members were way past the embers of city-supported town-building. They were furthering the reaches of their specializations in the trade structure, delivering new goods to the market and increasing the share of the alliance’s income.\nEven with Witchman’s recent advancements, he was still many steps away, being flanked by competition at many sides.\nMichel, his most mentioned benefactor, even amid her participation in the coastal engagement with Witchman, had personal interests. She recently signed as an entrant into the new adventurer guild. Though, it was often humorously referred to as a “builder barracks” instead, considering how even the adventurers were being made to build and tend to tasks like inspecting the land and features in order to smoothen the relocation process for new residents.\nTo sum, adventurers could be compared to a pageboy for the community members becuase they were specialized in combat with skills and all and were flexible workers.\nMichel met with several adventurers, having known several of them since many moved to the new town to reap the benefits of a fertile land, especially considering the low-level dungeon. It was typical for most adventurers to favor low-level dungeons because they gave more loot for lower levels of effort. But that didn’t mean that high-level dungeons were unrewarding. They just demanded a better class of adventurer.\n“How has the impisces been going so far?” she said, her voice a little tired from the engagement. It hadn’t been a day yet since then, but it was typical for adventurers to be the social lifeblood of the city, active even during the night. Furthermore, the term “impisces” referred to magical artifacts used to establish communication across the city, but they were only used for emergencies at the moment due to being expensive to build and maintain and to use mana-wise.\nShe didn’t think much of it, finding it difficult for her to return to the border to help out. The border was being expected to standardize, and it was growing more contentious as the rewards grew and the quality of adventurer raised with the current war. She couldn’t help out because it was cheaper to have higher-level adventurers stand watch instead. Adventurers didn’t have to worry about their skills getting worse overtime, so for those who were stronger, often times, they only needed to sit down and relax until an attack occurred. Then, they would use their stuck-in-time skills and spells, frustrating any effort at a noticeable dent on the border.\nHer rank was much lower than the rest, and her only use was being a border guard. Now that she and the adventurers accompanying her right now were no longer wanted, they immediately looked for opportunity elsewhere.\nBut the expectations of the town becoming important was low. So those who did participate in its development could be considered risk-takers.\nShe smirked, as she went to the nearby dungeon, casting several spells that struck several skeletons. It did was negligible poke damage, but it healed her. She did this every once in a while to avoid spending too much money relying on healers to help her maintain her necrotic arm.\nFlanking a heated pot held up by a fence-like frame, she stood next to a chair created with the help of very talented craftsmen. These craftsmen formed a small group along with workboys, assistants, and apprentices. To explain, apprentices were more like assistants, workboys did more menial work, and assistants helped out with more delicate work while not actually being apprentices.\nThe tents nearby her were white and had curtains.\n“Fish,” was the only she understood from something one of her adventurer friends said, going over these tents, her focus somewhat distracted.\nAfter a brief pause, she looked up and said, “Oh, the cat.” She got some fish head from her banana peel.\nIncidentally, several children emerged from the side, wrestling with each other, shouting with joy and excitement, their playing reminiscient of the glorious sun.\nThey lounged, making their way through the corridors of the monolith called the world. Their knowledge lended to ingenious ideas when they climbed, ran, dashed, leapt, and dodged, their all manners of play rendering them unstoppable.\nThey flew toward the sky briefly before falling down, catching themselves and each other on the feathery ground. Their eyes were closed with contentment, later opening again to guide their feet through the rich quality of the forest haven.\nWhat was amazing to them was dull to the adults because times changed.\nOn that note, Michel returned to her spot in the new town, gathering her things together and leaving homeward.\nAt home, soon, she recalled the necromancy lab she saw as a child. It had a warehouse, an infirmary, clothing shop, alchemy shop, mad alchemist, weapon shop, a graveyard where she could recruit undead, enhancers, and wagons to bring her and the undead to fight.\nShe wished to bring that dream to life.\nShe later met with Witchman.\nSpeaking of which Witchman, he reunited with Michel and Brackern and Brandon too. He called them by their full names.\nBrandon was Redspiller Warmaker.\nMichel was Doomsinger Mighttaker.\nBrackern was Suneater Herculeanridder.\nWitchman didn’t thinking much about it, but he knew that names gave power, which was why he changed his name, hoping to be rewarded by the [System] somehow.\nTo explain, Brandon’s first name “Redspiller” increased his chance of bleeding by 10% on all instances of damage, and his second name “Warmaker” increased his chances at provoking large conflict if he was the one in charge by 10%.\nThis was simple enough, but it didn’t really sound like something Witchman could measure by observation.\nMichel’s first name “Doomsinger” increased her damage dealt by 12% on enemies below 13% health. Witchman didn’t understand how the name led to that passive ability. Her second name “Mighttaker” led to her gaining one unused stat point upon killing any higher-level opponent. Witchman thought that this was too strong and tied well with her necromancy skill of making traps stronger.\nAs for Witchman, his new name didn’t give him anything yet. He asked about it, but they said that even normal names usually had an effect, even if they weren’t necessarily obvious like “Redspiller”. Though, it was often random and useless.\nHe hoped to received something that strengthened his magic abilities somehow, so he went for “Witchman,” thinking it might make him more like a witch because he thought “Mageman” or something similar was too vague and might give him a passive ability that didn’t specialize well. His reasoning was based on intuition, but that could only go so far.\nHe shrugged and would deal with the consequences, whatever they were.\nAfter catching up somewhat with the three adventurers about events, feelings, and adventuring, they parted aways with deep breaths and introspective gaits paving the way.\nSince things had changed so much since he last went to the inn, Witchman went there, hoping to see Lumi, Thorne, and Elara leaving. But they weren’t there. He frowned briefly before smiling with self-admonishment. He already knew that he would miss them.\nBut life had gone so well for him. Who could fault him for being hopeful?\nThe world allowed him to rest softly into the gentle early morning while it was still dark. His heart spurned thoughts of grief, sorrow, anger, strife, and conflict and accepted a sense of defeat, that which preceded victory.\nThe next morning, at Witchman’s cottage, the [System] offered Witchman the new skill—[Cattle Decapitation]—along with the new [System] quest.\nCattle Decapitation (Level 1)\nCost: 100 Mana Cooldown: 24 days Cast Time: Instant Effect Radius: 37500 (150 meters) Width: 1200 (4.8 meters) Speed: 15000 (60 meters) per second\nActive: The user channels dark energy, summoning a surge of spectral cattle skulls that charge forward in a line. Enemies caught in the surge take high magical damage and are stunned. Additionally, enemies hit by the surge have their defenses weakened, reducing their armor and magic resistance for a short duration.\nDamage: 208.1 (200 + 30%🔥) Stun Duration: 1.5 seconds Armor Reduction: 20 Magic Resistance Reduction: 20 Debuff Duration: 3 seconds\nThe [System] said: “I have been holding you back from getting skills because I didn’t think you deserved it. But now… I’m starting to see a trend that I like.”\nWitchman covered half his face, wiping his sweat, and nodded. “Thank you… are there any other options?”\nThe [System] smirked. “How about this?”\nEmpathy (Level 1)\nCost: 100 Mana Cooldown: 24 days Cast Time: Instant Effect Radius: 250 (1 meter)\nActive: The user taps into their empathic abilities, projecting waves of understanding and compassion. Allies within the radius of the effect gain increased resilience and morale for 4 seconds. They also receive a shield that absorbs damage equal to 20% of their maximum health. Additionally, allies affected by Empathy have their cooldowns reduced by 20% for the duration.\nDuration: 4 seconds Shield Strength: 20% of maximum health Cooldown Reduction: 20%\nWitchman knew how powerful shields were, especially since they allowed repositioning to advantage, and they were much more flexible than skills like [Cattle Decapitation].\n“Guess why you have these options?” the [System] said.\n“Why?” Witchman said.\n“[Empathy] came from the Kindness quest, while [Cattle Decapitation] came from your mental deterioration!”\n“Huh? Wouldn’t [Cattle Decapitation] be [Mental Disorder] then?” He laughed nervously, hoping he didn’t say something ominous.\n“Maybe… But I don’t really choose it. It’s random! But also depends! So keep doing those quests, then you’ll have more options next time. You’ll lose [Empathy] if you choose the cattle one, so pick wisely!” He disappeared.\nWitchman rubbed his temples, his distraught expression naked for the world to see. “Why 24 days cooldown? Is this like a lottery ticket or the opposite… thereof? I don’t even know.”\n“Does mana even matter? I haven’t seen mana…”\nThe [System] showed him his stats with two new attributes.\nAttack Damage🪓: 75\nAbility Power🔥: 27\nArmor🛡️: 57\nMagic Resistance🚫: 60\nHealth🗿: 906\nMana💧: 311\nMana regeneration💧 (per 10 minutes): 7\nHe realized that his priorities would shift toward analyzing his stats and his skills and how he could use them.\nAt the cottage, Witchman smelled the air, and it was humid. He smelled, so he took a shower, freshening up. As soon as he went outside, the sun warmed his body delightfully. Filled with awe, he stared at the trees outside and their rustling leaves.\nHe sat down and waited.\nHe remembered something, running all the way to a certain cottage.\nHe saw a familiar group of ducks and one bigger swan that had gathered on the vegetation.\nHe saw a particular woman.\n“Drakekiller Rollingthunder,” he said. “You killed someone…”\n“Yeah… what about it?” she said, laying down an old blade, next to a bowl of sopa. Incidentally, she took a sip from it, sustaining an obvious slurping noise.\nAnyway, Witchman never addressed many issues he had encountered in his life here on this world, but he thought that he should address this one. As for why he came here alone, he made a mistake.\n“Shit.” He remembered the disgusting man.\nChapter 29 - Solipsistic Slaughter linkTo address how he came to the mistake of coming alone to Drakekiller’s place, he didn’t want all his eggs in one basket. Moreover, a part of him felt that he was back to square one. As for the reason of this, most of his successes had largely stemmed from him playing the metaphorical merchant selling group tactics and dynamics. Specifically, he organized adventurer parties or teams to work together on quests systematically through the guild board.\nThis was why he wanted to diversify into the goblin realm. But in the end, his situation.\nReturning to the present, he was worried he triggered an event that could lead to a fight, so even now, he was staring and waiting for the woman to speak. His life was in her hands because he lacked information. If he had information beforehand, then this situation wouldn’t have happened.\nHe made sure to pick up the [Cattle Decapitation] skill in case she decided to attack, and he wished that he could’ve just chosen the more flexible skill [Empathy]. But this situation happened. In the end, his next steps would involve prioritizing information gathering even more.\nAs for why he remembered the disgusting man, it was a similar situation of a lack of information regarding dangers and risks. After that previous encounter with that man, he later learned that this man was a bandit capable of portal teleportation. If he knew about this, would that have made a difference? Likely no, but if he knew that portal magic existed and understood the skills the disgusting man used, he wouldn’t have been caught off guard. Knowing the enemies’ skills was common in tournaments with regulars, but it was different in this world where enemies could have all kinds of skills. However, with enough knowledge and systematic preparation, hesitation and inefficiency could be mitigated.\nAnyway, the woman didn’t make a move yet, so he continued normally: “Was that someone a bandit?”\n“Yes,” said the woman.\n“Thank God.”\n“Why… Oh, I should have explained. I’m sorry. It’s been a while since I’ve really gone outside.”\n“Outside?”\n“I mean there in the city. I am outside… haha…” She was laughing to herself.\n“Have… you been alone all this time?”\n“No… maybe…”\nHe didn’t squint. “So what do you want to do now?”\n“Now? I don’t know. When I spoke to you last, I was feeling kinda sure… yeah… something like that.”\n“Really… I guess you were like that right?”\n“Yeah.”\n“Is it… comfortable… in the forest, you know?”\n“Something about the forest… I, I, I, I, I…. I haven’t seen much about what’s going on the city. Tell me about it.”\n“The… You did say that Sophia used to be someone… you knew…hmm?”\n“Yes. Uh, but it’s been a while, so I don’t know.”\n“Really… Uh, do you still want to go to the city…”\n“Not really.”\n“How about… traveling?”\n“No. I’m just thinking of staying for a while before moving to a different place. But I’m not completely sure if… things are going to go well… It’s been a while after all.”\nWitchman didn’t want to continue this conversation for too long, as per his habit of a fast-paced lifestyle. But he did find some value in talking to a hermit. “So what’s been going on recently that you feel like saying… something interesting, you know?”\n“I was taking care of a chest… The kind that moves… The mimic one…”\n“Uh, interesting—what?”\n“Yeah. I was… speaking to three demons… and they were… with the chest.”\n“What!”\n“Yeah, yeah. I just never really thought about it, but it’s kinda funny that they’ve been here long long enough… for a while that I was able to learn that they actually came from a nearby dungeon, which is weird they… aren’t… how do I say this… protective… or something like that?”\n“Protective? What do you mean?”\n“They aren’t strong. No, They aren’t monsters? I think that’s what I’m trying to say.”\n“So they’re move like people?”\n“Yeah, I think that’s what I mean. I wasn’t really… there.”\n“You weren’t there…?”\n“I was going to the city actually because I wanted to make sure they had food and stuff before they left, and I don’t know. I never tamed a monster, so I’m not sure what they do. But I do remember that there’s a specific food that can be bought that makes them… tamed monsters… stronger.”\n“Are you sure it would work on them though?”\n“Yeah—I don’t know.”\nWitchman raised his voice: “Why? Why do you… Why?”\n“Uh, yeah…”\n“I can try… to tell you about it, but I’m… I don’t know.”\n“You don’t know. Can you not be so… I’m sorry. Just… It’s been a while I guess, and I’m learning”—he laughed—“something new for the first time again. Can you, can you, can you tell me about it?”\n“Sure.”\n“Before that… why does it feel like you’re a little tired or something?” He didn’t want to be mean, but he just wanted to ask.\n“What? Oh, I am a little tired… I haven’t slept… as you can tell.” She pointed at her eyebags.\n“Right,” he said succinctly. “So how did you meet these people?”\n“People?”\n“The mimic?”\n“I saw them. They were walking around, and they were actually attacking bandits from what I saw. I saw it, and it’s very unusual. But I didn’t think much of it because I guess I wasn’t really thinking that it could be a big problem. If they were this close to the city, then most likely, the adventurers had it under control, because back in my day, we used to hang around the city periphery because that was the only way to keep the monsters from entering the city grounds. At that time, the city and its walls were less, much less. And I guess I just didn’t really think about why the mimic was there.”\nHe was confused why she was so clear about her past but so weirdly unclear about the mimic. “What?”\n“Yeah, so when I did see them, my first instinct was to just stay back and not think too much about it.”\n“Wait, wait, what if they were dangerous? There’s a war going on, you know? It would be weird if we just let them do whatever they want.”\n“That makes sense.”\n“No, it doesn’t make sense. How about the demons?”\n“The demons… They were… really weird. They sounded weird. They were very talkative, and I thought I was going to die actually.”\n“Because you didn’t run.” He lowered his voice to a murmur. “What are you a horror show side character?”\n“Should we tell the city?”\n“You really have no idea how crazy this situation is.”\nHer recounting of the event was just about to be the weirdest shit he had ever seen in his life.\nAfter their conversation, he returned to the cottage with a sigh. For the first time in a while, he thought out loud: “Wait a minute. Were people like this? Do they just tell themselves, ‘Well, okay, hnh-hnh, I am the epitome of life, and everything will work out. Wow!’ Seriously can you tell me what the fuck is going on? Why am I supposed to fucking do all the fucking work and not at all see any single progress from people whatsoever…” He sounded incredibly sarcastic.” It is so funny. It is the funniest thing, just seeing people being so irrational incompetent like a bunch of loser limp-dicks whose lives are being dicated by their dumbass shitty hole of a brain.” He pretended to clear his throat as a polite signal to counterbalance his high level of frustration. “No… There’s just this funny thing… There’s just this funny thing about people. When I see them, they talk, they squawk, they live like little ducks sitting in a pond. And you know what I see? Nothing. No words, no talking. No little human being in this world because apparently, people like to stroke their little mm-hmm in order to facilitate their little demise.” He didn’t want to see people constantly putting him at a distance because it was so damaging to his operation, to his managing, to his hoping, to his dream, and to his life. He wondered why people did this. He said half-genuinely, half-sarcastically, with a concluding smile: “I am the person who had tried my best to understand why people do things, and I don’t know still. But I’m hoping that things work out.”\nHe took a deep breath. He was doing so much for everyone, but no one was there. Because of all his disappointment and confusion, he did something he had never done and only done back on Earth. He took a long shower lasting an hour. It was a good thing this world had the proper technology and infrastructure for this, because if not, he would go bat-shit insane.\nWas it valid for him to express his frustration? He had never expressed this explicit level of frustration after over three months, and he had gone through so much rough shit during that time. People helped him, but he was beginning to see a lack of progress from people in terms of their clarity of communication. It felt that despite all his efforts, he hadn’t really made any progress really when it came to bringing people closer to him. Instead, it felt like he was distancing himself further the more he tried to help people and improve the overall state of things. In the end, he was finally venting out all of that.\nIn simple terms, he wanted people to communicate clearly and effectively. “If they just did this, if they just did that. If they just communicated this, if they just communicated that” would all go away if people actually reciprocated his proactivity. He was a champion of a people that couldn’t sit on their knees—always lying down and embracing the earth and all its failures.\nHe needed to correct their little loser lives. He was the epitome of grace and beauty.\nAnd if he could, he would rather not need people. He was tired of the unpredictability of others and wished that he alone became everything.\nHe wanted to help others, sure, but collaborating with others was a feat he couldn’t attain.\nHe needed to enact his justice through solo leveling.\n“[System], please, I need your help,” he said.\nThe [System] appeared with a validating expression.\nHe continued: “I want to try doing this alone. These people, these apes, are unable to do anything whatsoever. I tried, I really did. My family’s so much better than these mofos. But look at me! Look at me! I am the only one keeping all this together! And I’m exaggerating, sure, but I do want to get things done. I do want to help people. I’m just tired of being left alone outside the gate once I’ve gathered my confidence and spent years trying to help people. What a joke! What a sick joke!”\nThe [System] had been nodding the entire time.\nThis was a dangerous echo chamber.\n“Don’t do this! Don’t!” didn’t exist here.\n“I am the epitome of grace and beauty,” Witchman said, quietly at first, before repeating it with a resounding yes.\nThe [System] acknowledged him. Instead of chuckling and saying how awkward and edgy he was, he groomed him further against being a crybaby loser who exhibited kindness, trust, and empathy so naively: “Why not?”\nThe [System] showed him a new skill, since it was his choice when to reveal the information about the skill anyway. That withholding of information used to be a source of contention between him and Witchman, but now, it was a mutual benefit.\n“What do you think?” he said.\nSolipsistic Slaughter (Level 1)\nCost: 150 Mana Cooldown: 30 days Cast Time: 0.75 seconds Effect Range: 1000 (4 meters)\nActive: The user channels their egoistic energy into a devastating strike aimed at a single target. The strike inflicts massive magical damage to the target and nearby enemies. Enemies hit by the strike have their sense of self shattered, causing them to doubt their own abilities. This doubt manifests as a reduction in their attack damage, ability power, and movement speed for a short duration.\nDamage: 300 (270 + 40%🪓) Area of Effect: 500 (2 meters) Attack Damage Reduction: 30 Ability Power Reduction: 30 Movement Speed Reduction: 30% Debuff Duration: 3 seconds\nThey both didn’t want to see it unused, so with the help of the flying [System], they went deep into the rainforest where the [System] guided him toward a group of goblins.\nWitchman used the skill against them even with the 0.75-second cast time, and the goblins succumbed to it quickly. They only had around 500 health, and their attack damage was less than that reduced by the skill debuff. So they dealt 0 damage to him for 3 seconds. One goblin had a skill, but it only stunned Witchman briefly and dealt too little damage to matter. Ultimately, Witchman barely moved and neutralized them with basic attacks since they couldn’t even run due to the slow debuff.\nThis was his first calculated kill.\nGreat job defeating 4 goblins by yourself quickly! You’ve earned yourself 42+ XP for your triumph! 🎉 50% bonus XP due to speed!\nHe didn’t mention it before, but he was in debt. The war made food go up in price threefold, and he spent lots of money to organize adventurer quest events. He even quit his employee relations job to help out more, but he later realized that was a mistake.\nHis frustration earlier was a money problem.\nSo his next priority was money.\nMarvelous achievement! Dispatching 4 goblins single-handedly and swiftly has rewarded you with 12+ gold coins! 🎉 Additionally, relish a 50% bonus in gold coins as recognition for your exceptional speed\nMonsters dropped coins, so that was part of his rationale behind being an quest event organizer. It could be compared to a bazaar event organizer, and that was partly his inspiration since Deathbringer, Sophia, and the rest of the former first party members sold as merchants of a bazaar. He accompanied them around that past time, also seeing Marcher with the villagers and then his body much later on in the war.\nHe was not in a happy place. He was in a pragmatic one.\nChapter 30 - The Epitome of Grace and Violence linkRumors began to circulate of Witchman’s feats under that new name, as he did move most of his activities to the farther adventurer guild where the name “Witchman” was born. Plus, this lowly guild was looking for new ways to boost their engagement, so they were willing to have Witchman be a frontman, even if much of the information they circulated was based on rumors.\nThis was good for the guild, but as soon as they approached him about it, Witchman had doubts regarding the actual effectiveness of rumor-based leadership. If he was only followed because he was good at double speak and rumor manipulation, he would not stand under the testimony of the adventurers he relied on so much. The role of a lone wolf was safer for now.\nThis would mean that he would center his influence to the field, but that could be dangerous, since as long as his name and feats was being held against him, he would have to comply with the image, or else he would be circulated as a fraud, which was even worse than being admired.\nHe was basically in a situation akin to blackmail.\nThese were the consequences of doing well—the tall poppy syndrome of “either be the frontman and leader or be cut down.”\nAs a response, his goal was to gather members, especially his admirers, to form an adventurer party, cultivating authenticity by consolidating his image and his actual presence. This would address his personal debt as well since being a leader commanded a higher percentage of the coin share.\nTo extend his activities to a broader level, he was already starting to demonstrate something akin to a monopoly within the city, having spent only 3 months in adventuring in order to reach a level where he was commanding three adventurer parties, although two were former ones, to work with him.\nReturning to the moment, Witchman was at the adventurer guild, which wasn’t actually a building but the quest board outside in front of the gate—a very scuffed representation. But it did provide Witchman with an idea of the different ways adventurer guilds can appear, which sparked a light in him for developmental plans ahead.\nAs soon as he stood there, he looked around for adventurers, finding two beggars walking around in an aimless manner. “Hey, do you guys know me? I’m the person who killed the goblins a little over there.” He wanted to get the job done and load them into a fresh group immediately.\nThe beggars nodded, but they didn’t look impressed. In fact, they just walked away.\nWitchman blinked with confusion. He didn’t expect that reaction.\nAnyway, the actual adventurers came, and that was his time to strike. He repeated himself, searching their faces for a smile.\nHe finally found them—his admirers.\nThey said that they could form a party with him, but they wanted to see his combat abilities first.\nWitchman smirked almost. He was fine with humility, but this was the right time to demonstrate what he could do. If he convinced them that his party was worth transferring to, he would reap the rewards.\nHe went out there a little deeper in the forest.\nFollowing, the adventurers stared at him.\nWitchman looked for a group of goblins, but it took an hour to find them.\nNow that he found them, he used his two skills: [Whirlwind Waltz] and [Cattle Decapitation]. [Solipsistic Slaughter] was still on cooldown unfortunately.\nThe goblins fell apart quickly like dominoes in a porey wind-struck shed.\n“What the…” Witchman said. It was his first time using the skills.\nThe adventurers cast their skills, not at the goblins, but at Witchman.\nWitchman fell to the ground. “Wait…” His voice was weak.\nDespite his meteoric rise, Witchman was in no way powerful.\nHe was beaten several times before being thrown against a tree.\nHe was kicked at the same spot many times.\nThey planned to kill him, but they wanted to test Witchman’s durability.\nWitchman was all alone now. Why did he ever leave his friends?\nThe adventurers told him that if he wanted to live, he could become their little pageboy.\nWere they really his admirers? Or did they admire him (his strength) so much they wanted him as a dog?\nHe goofed and missed the signs that they were abnormal. He was too sure of himself.\nWhy didn’t the [System] help him now?\nHe was dragged to a surface lava pit.\nHe shouted with all his might: “Please, I’m sorry! I don’t what I did to you! But please! I don’t want to die!” He was so used to being so powerful behind that metaphorical desk of control and superiority where he chatted away and told people what to do. He had forgotten that everyone had a plan until they got punched in the face—the easy defeat of an arrogant human being by people sycophantic and opportunistic enough to do so.\n“Please!” He had so much potential.\nHe was thrown into the lava pit.\nWitchman burned, begging the world to feel sorry for him.\n“No!” he screamed ferociously.\nHe was removed from the lava pit and then healed with red potions.\nThen he was dumped into the pit again.\n“No!” His voice was muffled this time.\nHe was removed from the laval pit and then healed with red potions.\n“Please! Not again, not again!”\nThen he was dumped into the pit again.\nHe gurgled.\nHe was brought back out, and the smiles on the adventurers’ faces were clear. “Join us.”\nWitchman realized that he had to become the epitome of grace, but in order to do that, he would have to be a slave for these people. If not, then his journey would end here. “Okay,” he said, adopting a serious expression. It was genuine, but it was also crafted for sincerity. He didn’t want to go back there.\nHe had no skills. They were on cooldown. That was why he lost.\nEven if he lost this battle, it didn’t mean he lost the game.\nHe would trust this world and his friends to win in their own lanes and continue to play the game. Getting gang-killed once was fine because he could turn things around with patience. Even if his lane was at a disadvantage, he could rotate outside the lane to the same objectives that all adventurers shared. This was actually what he did when he organized an adventurer quest coalition to attack the monster hideout. Alternatively, he could focus on taking uncontested objectives while his enemy counterparts focused on other objectives. That was also his goal for being here at this side of the city with the less established adventurer guild, but he didn’t respect his enemies and got caught. As for a third alternative, it would involve going to other lanes and gang-killing at objectives, letting off pressure in other lanes before returning to his own station. This was effectively what he did with his fellow adventurers at two past events: the coastal engagement and the monster hideout attack. Overall, he needed to maximize his lane pressure and keep his enemy counterparts with minimal pressure. This was why he wanted to broaden his scope of influence, which he started by meeting Drakekiller.\nIn conclusion, he followed the adventurers who had group-attacked him with a systematic approach.\nAs for the group, they had 8 plots against him: a magical contract to prevent him from attacking them, threats of further torture and punishment if he rebelled or didn’t comply, recruiting other prisoners to increase the group’s manpower and leverage against him, conditional rewards, physical restraints, isolation and segregation, constant surveillance, and using him for dangerous tasks or missions on behalf of the group. To clarify, they couldn’t have a magical contract that prevented him from indirectly attacking them through asking for help and such, so isolation was a must. They also couldn’t have a contract that made him follow their orders forever.\nBringing the focus back to immediacy, the adventurers watched Witchman, hesitating whether it was more advisable to kill him now or continue with the plan. If Witchman showed any sign of strength, they would eliminate him.\nBut Witchman was careful, allowing himself to express his fear through shaking hands.\nThis made it easier for the adventurers to guarantee that their plan could work if they managed effectively.\nThe mental effects of post-torture trauma saved him.\nThough, he didn’t know why they didn’t just euthanize him. Was keeping him as an elephant worth the trampling cost? Couldn’t they just have gotten experience and levels from his death? Maybe, using him to trample enemies was an effective strategy?\nMeanwhile, one of the adventurers smiled. “Excuse me,” he said.\nWitchman glanced at him before looking at the rest of the adventurers. “What…” he mumbled.\n“Do you want to see something?” The adventurer looked like he was about to show something funny or cool to his younger brother.\nWitchman was confused. Why were they being like this?\n“Okay…”\nThe adventurer dragged him to a cave. “This is a dungeon.”\n“Yeah—”\n“No, but look!” He pointed excitedly.\nWitchman glanced before realizing that the cave was very vast, and it had lush vegatation hanging from the ceiling. “What is that?”\n“Lush caves!”\n“Really…”\nThe adventurer grabbed Witchman and kicked him, beating him again and again, growling in rage. “Shut the fuck up!”\nWitchman was unable to think for a while.\nSeveral awkward minutes passed before he got up and wondered what the hell just happened. The adventurer was mentally unstable.\nWitchman wanted to face-palm.\nThe adventurers went to the goblins and beat them up, torturing them with his fists.\nWitchman rubbed his forehead. If that adventurer hadn’t beat him up and shouted at him, he might have been on the side. But now, he was just pissed off.\nHe stretched his head, twisting it sideways with hidden frustration.\nHe had never killed a human being, but the goodness of the earth was inherent in his actions. Thus, whatever he did was an example of that inherence. Moving forward, he would create life by establishing order. Here, he was most dignified and creative. Should the world fall to the ground, he would be its guiding light, shining upon the farthest horizon.\nHe was also struggling a bit.\nHe was beaten many times throughout the journey and verbally abused, interspaced with hope-giving gestures and interactions, breaking his will unto oblivion.\nAs time passed, he began to smile inwardly because justification was necessary for a slaughter. The love inherent in slaughter was imminent, because if he could get rid of the evil within their souls, he would free them to Heaven.\nHe loved the suffering, his frustration and anger becoming mixed with feelings of euphoria. The impulsiveness characteristic of euphoria contributed to his violent thoughts. His euphoria was a manifestation of a combination of various factors, making it a complex reaction.\nMany torturous, euphoric hours later, he stood as weakly as he could stand.\nBut within that posture of weakness, Justification reigned supreme.\nHe was the epitome of grace and beauty, and violence was just another way to express his love.\nHe beat them to death.\nHe crushed their spines and dislocated their bones, wishing upon them joy and beauty, because he was inevitably their loving father.\nHe loved them unto death.\nHis skills manifested as the hurricanes of love.\nBecause of his mental instability, the magical contract didn’t register as him attacking them, because he did it out of love.\nAfter his emotions stabilized, he pondered about this event.\nWhen a systematic approach lapsed and failed, it was usually not because agents (people) were completely rational. It was because they double-downed to instances reflecting irrational behavior with a combination of reasons such as emotions, duty, loyalty, beliefs, and morals.\nHe was not playing a video game with consistent rational agents. He was in real life where people acted recklessly and did whatever the hell they wanted, and he couldn’t control them.\nBut he yearned to.\nTaking into account non-rational factors would fine-tune his systematic approach for the better, given that he himself was not an exclusively rational agent.\nThat was why he was frustrated with people and why it was so hard to make an empire. People struggled with emotions such as jealousy, envy, and pride even, making it practically impossible for him to succeed without someone coming from the most unlikely place and tearing him down.\nHe would rather annex people’s hearts and make them his slaves if he wanted a rational game, with only his irrational aspects to struggle with. If it was him alone, it would be a walk in the park, but with others coming into play, it was like swallowing dirt on the ground to get one’s nutrition—very ineffective and cumbersome.\nLater, when he returned to the cafe, he met with Michel, getting a laugh out of her when she recounted a tale of her falling in the middle of a quest coalition. He felt admiration when she added that she was able to help vanquish several hundred goblins with her traps.\n“How are you getting these coalition quests?” he added half-jokingly at the end of the conversation. “Am I hiding under a rock?”\n“Arthur, hey, how are you doing?” Michel said to a man walking up to them.\nThe man saw Witchman, and they both gave the silent male nod of respect and acknowledgement. It was a far cry from what Witchman experienced under the adventurers he killed earlier.\nWhen he remembered that horrible event while sipping some coffee with a relaxed smile, he realized that his violent, rational, and lighthearted facets were beginning to blur together. He was becoming both full and well-rounded.\nHe grinned.\nHe was an example of the reason why supreme leaders rose to power. They were never monoliths, always multi-faceted.\nArthur and Witchman hit it off, laughing together about trivial things, even if Arthur was not an adventurer and in fact a librarian.\nWitchman knew too many people like Arthur back on Earth, so no matter what happened, his Earthly experiences would make him a dynamic creature, morphing to eat up the souls of others, with their diverse stakes and situations.\nSince he had free time now that he didn’t have a job, he followed Michel on her many meetings in various places. Should she be in need in space, he would sit or stand far away in any case.\nHe met different kinds of people. He met a priest named “Johun”, who prepared a table for him in the direction of the rainforest, annointed his head with oil, and poured into his cup until it overflowed.\n“Do you believe in God here?”\n“Yes, we believe in God here. Do you believe?”\n“Yes, but it depends on what you mean… There are different types… of… church if you know what I mean.”\n“Oh, what sect do you belong to?”\n“Sect? Uh. No, I’m independent.”\n“Really? So you don’t pray?”\n“No, I do. I just don’t do it as… you know… similar to how they do it in… the sect.”\n“Okay. Don’t backslide, okay? And if you have, repent and return to God.” His tone was friendly and sounded open to disengaging, so Witchman didn’t feel bothered. It was just an awkward discussion to have, given that he killed three human beings earlier.\nWitchman smiled in an easygoing, awkward manner.\nAfter Michel’s refreshing meetings, he finally had alone time with her to ask, “Why are some people, like adventurers, broken in the head?”\n“Some adventurers live in areas where they starve, barely eating meat, so that makes them angry.\nWitchman understood that as malnutrition and starvation contributing to emotional volatility, associating this with the adventurer he killed earlier.\nHe wanted to say that there was no way that malnutrition led to murder. People had to do the right thing whatever their circumstances, even if they were being tortured everyday for 70 years. It was their fault if they hurt people. But this was an underdeveloped view of reality.\n“Why don’t people use their skills and spells to remove poverty then? If they have magical money, why don’t they help the poor?” It was a child’s question, but he had to ask it. He was effectively a child after all in this new world.\nMichel had a response: “You can help them, Matthew.”\nMatthew looked at his notifications.\n🌟 Congratulations on your triumphant solo elimination of a level-26 bandit!

He wasn’t asking anyone for permission anymore.\nWhirlwind Waltz (Level 8)\nCost: 1000 Mana Cooldown: 1 hour Cast Time: 0.5 Effect Radius: 350 (1.4 meters)\nActive: The user gracefully dances, channeling for 0.5 seconds, colors flashing around them. After the channel, they create a whirlwind of energy around them that lasts for 4 seconds. Enemies within the whirlwind are lifted off the ground, unable to move or attack for 2.375 seconds. After the whirlwind dissipates, affected enemies are slowed by 30% for 2 seconds.\nDuration: 4.875 seconds Immobilization Duration: 2.375 seconds Slow Duration: 2.875 seconds\n“Wait a minute…” Witchman’s mouth was agape. “I have to put all my points into mana. No one told me this. Frick.” It was a minor mistake, and he would fix it sooner or later.\nName: Matthew Cruz\nLevel: 44\nCurrent experience: 218\nSpecies: Human\nAge: 25\nSkills: [Whirlwind Waltz], [Cattle Decapitation], [Solipsistic Slaughter]\nSpells: None / None\nVitality: 15\nQuests: [Bridge of Knowledge]\nTitles: [Goblin Slayer], [Skeleton Slayer], [Overlord’s Gifted]\nUnused stat points: 46.2\nHe still didn’t understand what [Vitality] was supposed to represent, and it didn’t seem to increase along with his other stats. If the [System] could hide his skills from him—basically gatekeeping him from receiving the skills he deserved—then he might not answer him about [Vitality].\nAttack Damage🪓: 75\nAbility Power🔥: 27\nArmor🛡️: 57\nMagic Resistance🚫: 60\nHealth🗿: 906\nMana💧: 311\nMana regeneration💧 (per 10 minutes): 7\nBut he first checked the cost of mana and mana regeneration.\nMana💧: 1.4 stat point (SP)\nMana regeneration💧: 60 SP\n“Huh…”\nMichel didn’t bother him since she was also writing some letters on her own, sending it to various people to keep in contact regarding business matters.\nWitchman noticed this and remembered his [System] and the [Forums]. After the [System] himself was unresponsive, he asked the only person he was in private direct messaging with, [Mark Reader], about using the [System].\n[Witchman 💀💀💀: Hi, I kind of forgot how to use the private messaging. Can I contact someone who doesn’t know about private messaging? I don’t know how to make that [System] send a message to someone by name. Is it possible? Thanks in advance. I hope this message reaches you well.]\nHe waited for a while, staring at Michel’s clothes.\n[Mark Reader: I don’t know.]\nHe wondered whether it was fruitful for him to be delving into Michel’s business.\nHe wanted to help her with the [System]’s private direct messaging system, but it wasn’t working.\nSo he decided to leave on short notice, meeting a familiar woman, Tamer Languiosse, whose smirk put butterflies in his stomach. It was a polite species of butterfly.\nWhen they found some place to eat, Tamer was happy finally to get to talk to Matthew again, considering their previous fruitful undertakings together. She imagined herself birthing the sensuous marriage between her hands and the wishes she had in mind—to flourish and develop her standing and her future estate. With that said, she scooped an assortment of fruits into her mouth, remarking with admiration, “What a splendid food we have today!”\nThey had an unmentioned casual meeting before, but it helped them gather their metaphorical boots and break that barrier between them, especially after the past series of quests. This was the iron string that kept their faces sponged in front of one another—a smile tying up the ribbons of their hearts in camaraderie.\n“I don’t know if it’s possible,” he said, “but have you considered taking some time off? When we met last, you did mention that the adventurer life had been taking a toll on your health. Plus, you said you used to be a child bride. I wish you only good favor.” Matthew adopted some of her vividly spread buttery language.\nShe was surprised, however, that he would be so concerned as to address it right in front of her. He had seen her health and behavior: her mirth abounded in bed flowers. “Right, well, in order to pursue such interests, it would be advisable if we gathered our resources first, then we can take a hold of the center of goblin abode!”\nTamer had a different facet to her when she wasn’t busy attending to a bunch of noisy goblin children. But her remarks were largely bombastic, not really attending to anything of substance. It was a declaration. Although not one made under duress, it was one made by a woman as fickle as a deciduous tree.\nAlongside the buttery flavors of the food bracing for flight in a variety of directions within their sweet, voluminous mouths, in a crispy manner, her smile was clarified. To emphasize it further, it was similar to a flower pot of gold.\nShe knew well to keep her appearance tight and clean, yet stylish and undeterred in her choices of wear. It was her duty almost to keep herself determined to choose creatively and fuse ideas into a statement.\nOf all the things she could be doing, she enjoyed her sweet time being herself wherever it mattered.\nAs soon as Matthew had eaten enough, he asked, “So, I know that with everything that’s happened, it wouldn’t be enough for us to sit idly while the goblins are within our grasp.” He wore a simple adventurer outfit, distinct from the purple and yellow attire Tamer had seen before. It made him look more in touch with people, but maybe he really was.\nTamer prioritized the conversation, happening to have forgotten about checking at the guild taking off her goblins’ clothes half the time. For context, she couldn’t just pop them out of existence, and as tiring as it was, she opted to care of them personally. “What do you mean? Where are these particular goblins? Is there a special event I’m missing? Why the rush?”\nWith the rising sun, Matthew’s admiral-like face looked more defined, and his eyes were more clearly sharp and amorous like a sadistic fox. “There’s been news of Tulips and Barkada Forces making rounds in the area, motivating the goblins to gather themselves just a little.”\n“Just a little?”\n“It isn’t that important, but we better police them before it’s too late. We don’t want them complaining of a stomach ache all of a sudden.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Oh, I meant that we don’t have to waste Michel’s traps. I’m pretty sure you know her.”\n“Yeah, I do. You’re right. I guess it’s been a while since I’ve been active. Why didn’t you talk to me since then?”\n“Because you didn’t talk to me?”\n“Oh, well, then… Just keep in touch, okay… Actually, let’s head to Guild now. I don’t want to waste time. I’ll just change my clothes, and we’ll head off.”\nLater, at the main adventerer guild, Tamer was surprised to see Matthew wearing a mask. It didn’t look sophisticated, but it had that mysterious and ominous look. “Why the mask?”\n“Oh, I just didn’t want to be seen. I was attacked by a group of bandits before, and I—”\n“Woah-woah-woah, bandits?” she yelped.\n“What? Is it that rare?”\n“Oh yeah it is. I mean it’s only been how long for you, and you already got bandits.”\n“Oh, yeah, about that. I’ve been here for more than three months already.”\n“Really? I guess it’s been a while since we last met.”\n“Yeah…” he said, giving her an august smile.\nThe hints of huskiness in his voice and those quippy expressions were a good match.\nEven with their complex dynamic, Tamer didn’t dare oust him from his position as leader. Indeed, she would gladly stand next to him shoulder-to-shoulder, as long as she got a piece of the rewards. That was soluble enough for her.\nMatthew led her down to the river where most people would find themselves in a circle of terror. This place was called the “Fourth Ring,” where an effect called the “Smog” lingered around the place, weakening adventurers.\nMatthew overviewed that they were here to represent a scouting, information-gathering, warding group; though, the warding here was practically impossible due to the ferocity presented within this monster hotspot. It was just a formality at this point.\nThe issue was that Matthew didn’t have [Whirlwind Waltz], but he was confident enough that [Solipsistic Slaughter] was strong enough. He also recognized Tamer’s abilities as a tamer, especially viewing that she brought five glowing goblins this time. She had grown, even without his administrative input. He recognized that and only wished that she never caved in to self-disrespect, especially as one that formed allegiances with goblins.\nQuasi-legioned forces tore through the openings throughout the dungeon. These monsters made their down the rough terrain leading to Matthew and Tamer spirally.\nMatthew revealed himself as Witchman, casting his skills confidently and stabbing at the monsters one by one. Even without a coalition and his [Whirlwind Waltz], he was capable of standing on his two feet.\nHe demanded Tamer to make herself useful when she froze, having been expecting Matthew to fight only when teamwork was the primary solution. But Matthew’s priorities had changed, having increased his capacity for combat.\nThis was where they reigned supreme—at uncontested objectives where they held a significant advantage over the enemy in terms of bringing them out of their folds. As soon as that happened, with the help of her goblins, it was easy for Tamer to use her holy water–filled barrels toward a congested enemy army, hitting the numbers individually and with equal distribution of damage and debuffs. Moreover, his use of [Solipsistic Slaughter] was indiscrimate, slicing those who came close enough in a crowd, turning them to piles of meat with the high area-of-effect damage.\nWhile Matthew corralled, Tamer guided him, treating him as a weapon, turning the direction and position of his onslaught by leading him according to her shot calls. They consistently focused on a singular flank instead of letting numerous prongs collapse on top of them. This was founded on her goblins as a speedy wall that she could raise as a weapon or draw back as a shield dynamically throughout the fight.\nAt the end of the battle, the wave of monsters fell apart to their declaration of systematic destruction.\nThey terrorized the area, turning it into a desolate place full of loot. As they picked up loot, an adventurer group entered, finding their solitary selves in a bit of a pickle. The loot was too many, and they were very heavy and large.\nWith the help of the friendly, positive, supportive adventurers, they were able to bulk-transport via a convoy of vehicles toward the city.\nAt the city, it was the truth that no one could come there alive without at least a pay check. That was why Matthew, being one brought into the city via an adventurer group, was compassionate to see people sitting on their haunches a large distance outside in front of the city gate. He didn’t want to help them without obeying the rules of business, which he thought was to extract money wherever applicable. So he was sorry he wanted to help and helped them anyway.\nHe showed the guards of the city gate that they were with him, paying the required fee per head and impressing Tamer on the way.\nTamer was not impressed by him morally. She was impressed by him as a weird, strange person who did whatever he wanted. This was one of the many times Matthew’s Earth knowledge, experience, and upbringing did good for him here in this world; albeit, it manifested in different forms. To Tamer, it was weirdness and an adamant personality that she liked. But to others, it might be more moral. It depended on the person.\nFor one, Desmond Leroy, who was approaching them right now, enjoyed Matthew’s high prowess in strategy—a gift from Earth—even if he did fail that one pivotal time.\nThey smiled and gave the male nod at the sight of each other; even Tamer did. She didn’t care for gender norms because in her mind, she had already proven herself to the males, being a female of authority and standing in her community. She did lead a party after all. It was not strange for those respected to be so amid their gender.\nIn a society marked by an appreciation toward magic and the elegance thereof, it was not strange that philosophical questions—with regard to the purpose of magic, and, by extension, everything else such as fairness, rights, and justice—became a standing phenomenon. In other words, the same way a standing army accrued costs, so did the elements of magic mediate curiosity by the thinking mind. Furthermore, with time and with a desire to promote power, knowledge was inherent. Following the celebrated turnover of that study, the scholars gravitated toward the seats of change. As for this consolidation of power, patronage, diligence, and talent were emphasized in this pursuit, but overall, the idea that women were lower was not something that people certified.\nTamer knew all about this, but this society was a forgery of limited opportunities, those blocked by monster interaction. Yet, she saw a world where the hunting of mammals could be stopped while retaining the divine blessings of God.\nShe professed herself a saintess in this enterprise, knowing the fallabilities of that goal. Goblin chiefdom was looked down upon by those above and below in the human hierarchical continuity. The latter people, the wantonly educated common folk, were too in one under the administration of the adventurists.\nIn the end, the secret practice of mammalism, or in a more bitter term, monsterism, could be viewed through her lens. This rested upon the hominid (human)-affiliated “Fight for Equality” in association with the goblin species.\nSpeaking of which, she hid her goblins under a cloak while Desmond and Matthew discussed the earnings of the recent “New Adventurers Division” formalized during a meeting between the adventurer guilds. Desmond—who played a tangential role in a contingent developing adventurer equipment for several notable semi-permanent coalitions regionally assigned to various monster hotspots—heard of it and shared this information first with his party and then with Matthew. It was a complex story, but it was unspoken between Desmond and his “Know-whos”, given that name because of their connection to Rodney and his information-swelling conspirators, that Matthew was a prodigy.\nBasically, Desmond was a key ally in Witchman’s growth.\nWitchman knew that his and Tamer’s feat at the Fourth Ring was a sign, considering that they hadn’t claimed the lesser “tributaries”, or quasi-hotspots, surrounding it. Simply, it looked targeted.\nUnbeknownst to him, Witchman was only beginning, and he had yet to caught up. His goal was to focus on small things, and this was why contacted Tamer. It was also because she was one of his first respondents, especially during a previous time when he was suffering.\nBut people were not things he could control. Even if he wanted a slower pace, he was forced to inject bountiful clumps of information and responsibilities, causing metaphorical clots.\nThe [System] was key to his assimulation into adventurer norms along with its ethical complexes.\nIn the end, he took a deep breath.\nHe got this.\nChapter 32 - Echoes of Destiny: The Rise of Grimtusk linkBack on Earth, a young woman, Emma, got up and tied her shoes, tearing apart some of the laces that had loose threads, as she walked up to convenience store. She didn’t much of her day, but she knew that any time now, things would change.\nShe just knew that she was special, even if this world had a tendency to bring people’s hopes down.\nWhen she returned home, she prepared food for herself, using the noodles that she bought and combining it with corned beef. She had strange tastes, but that didn’t stop her from enjoying herself.\nAfter finishing her food, she went to her computer and searched the web, finding several games that she wanted to play. She didn’t play that much recently, but recently, she had found motivation to play older games that she used to play. After playing those games, she was here right now thinking of playing newer games from the 2020s.\nShe found a web game that depicted a man living in a survival island. It was gamified, so it had all the fun iconography and promotional illustrations.\nAs soon as she got the hang of it, she realized that she was enjoying herself. It wasn’t like Battle of Wesnuth or Red Stane Online, but the main aspects and visuals of the game fit right into her current mood.\nLater, at the end of the day, she wanted to go back to sleep, but she visited a church friend at her job.\n“What’s going on, man?” Emma said in an American accent. She was born and raised Filipino, but since she was raised by an English-speaking family who delved into computers and the Internet much earlier than most people, she often imitated the accents of the people she saw online and in wealthier neighborhoods and social hotspots. But she didn’t do it for any reason. She just had a tendency to do it.\n“Yeah,” said her church friend, Marianna, whose forehead was beginning to wrinkle. She had a clear Filipino accent.\n“Op!” Emma gestured toward the wrinkle with her lips, brows, and eyes.\nMarianna caught the message immediately and relaxed her face. “How are you na, friend?”\n“I’ve been talking to some of your friends earlier, and none of them are answering. What happened? Did they get lost while hiking na?”\n“No, no, they’re okay. Thanks for asking.” Marianna looked tense a little.\nBut Emma thought it was okay for them to talk since it was late and her shift was over.\nThey were actually sitting down outside, and there were no more customers fortunately.\nMarianna forgot Emma tended to come when she was working her shifts here. She transferred between two different work spaces periodically, but the good thing was that it wasn’t too far. She also could stay in with her father’s house for one and her mother’s house for the other. They were separated, and she had both a step father and a step mother. It was complicated, but it worked for her.\nBut Emma was unemployed, and so she had more time. They were childhood friends, so it wasn’t difficult for them to have something to talk about. Emma was ever-curious though recently, while Marianna was bathing in a nostalgic mood.\nThey were acquaintances of Matthew Cruz, or Witchman. But it had been years since they talked.\nTheir lives were so different from the brutal place where Witchman now resided.\nThey were visions of an earlier time.\nReturning to Witchman, he was arranging his things, and his mind was churning. His decision to attack the Fourth Ring was premeditated, but he didn’t do it without risks. For one, he capitalized on the fact that the Fourth Ring was a shared space between adventurers, so any adventurer that had dealt damage to pre-existing monsters would help other adventurers coming later. He knew that the monsters were lower and that he could much easily burst them to bits. But even now, monsters did spawn continuously.\nHis attacks reaped a bountiful harvest.\n🌟 Congratulations on your triumphant solo elimination of 46 level-3 slimes! Your combat prowess secures you a rewarding 100+ XP! 🌟\n🌟 Congratulations on your triumphant solo elimination of 26 level-4 slimes! Your combat prowess secures you a rewarding 100+ XP! 🌟\n🌟 Congratulations on your triumphant solo elimination of 35 level-5 slimes! Your combat prowess secures you a rewarding 100+ XP! 🌟\nThough, the calculation didn’t make sense. Why was it limited to 100 experience?\nHe stopped for a moment and took a deep breath. Logically, it was better to seek advice from Rodney, Desmond, Tamer, and, to some degree, Michel, but he missed Sophia, Deathbringer, and the rest of the former members of his first adventurer party, the one that had saved his life. He wanted to use the excuse of this 100 experience problem to talk to them.\nVisiting their house, he prepared himself.\nAfter talking to them for a while, he learned that the 100 experience limit was normal.\nThough, he wasn’t satisfied with that answer. Was this the limit of experience and levels?\nEither way, he never wanted to depend on the [System] anyway because he had no way of determining if it would come back to bite him. He would rather trust the natural world, even if this natural world intersected with the [System] to a symbiotic degree, because most of his life experiences rested upon the natural world, especially since this new world was still very foreign to him.\nHe had seen many kinds of species, people, magic, and all sorts of phenomena, but he had never described them a single time, because they were too much for his mind to bear.\nHe just went with the flow, even when he only understood partially his own role in this society and in the adventurer community.\nEven now, he hadn’t met anybody so bitter so as to impossible to work with. Instead, he always had people behind his back helping him. People in general had the tendency to be kind. It was only projection that made people seem hard to trust and like.\nDespite the torture, suffering, and the horrible acts he had committed against the goblin species, he still wanted to believe that he could atone for his sins. But he still didn’t understand anything. He might be a part of a systematic eradication that he only had yet to comprehend.\nThe camaraderie he experienced with villagers only made it challenging for him to break away from hunting goblins.\nIt was getting too late for him to separate from his significantly beneficial multilateral partnership with the [System] and with being an adventurer. The more he relied on it, the more painful it was when he reflected on his past because things were going too fast for him to make sense of things. Moreover, the fact that he succeeded in the Fourth Ring only intensified this overwhelmingly fast pace. The success only masked the depth of his life, much of which he hadn’t found time to address.\nSo he went into hiding from the activities of the world.\nDuring that time, the goblins received a new upgrade. They invented a new magic spell.\nA goblin leader from the north, a goblin lord, rose from the depths of weakness, opening up hovels of life from which spawned goblins upon goblins. Terror cluthed all over with its sharp blades, sending a message that Grimtusk was birthed. And his presence would be much more felt than Mawkery for the next coming seasons.\nOn her first quest since reuniting with Witchman, Sophia ran around, healing in the form of electric surges of light that beamed toward her targets. She kept an eye on them, as goblins spread from a nearby hole.\n“Scree!” their voices clamored like fairy dust, as the bloom of their new spell arrived with feathery wings.\nIncidentally, one of the goblins shot, an arrow laced with poison, striking toward the heart of Sophia. Upon impact, it broke her stride, enforcing a message to all healers to stop, as the rest of the healers of her group were struck in a similarly disabling manner.\nAnyway, the spell came in the form of flying goblins, tearing through the air like doves making their presence known. It was here that the adventurers fled and retreated, leaving their brethren in the midst of battle.\nSophia yelped and screamed, as her form was discarded bunch by bunch, finger by finger. Her form became naught.\nShe lost her life that day, as Marcher did. But at least she was given a few mentions in the book of life. Though, the [System] was always uncaring and callous, amid Matthew’s perseverations with kind-heart.\nMatthew knew well that his time was over, so Witchman, his growing persona, took hold of the shifty wheel.\nWhen his time of hiding was over, he saw to it that he would visit the dead.\nHe saw Sophia and several of her friends lying together, but it was too much for him to bear.\nHe grieved for her passing, but his grief had been described in full already. If this was expressed more, he would be hurting the world by doing so.\nHe couldn’t leave the city, but he dared to help someone, trying Michel in particular.\nShe said that it was only right that adventurers lost their lives.\nMatthew was naturally offended at that, but Michel corrected herself later, mentioning that it was natural, even if it was not right—it was something so systematic that it was like nature, similar to science so advanced that it was incomparable to magic before the eyes.\nMatthew countered by mentioning her desire for goblin blood, but Michel said that in a culture so familiar to goblin-hunting, it was not strange for her to thirst after their lifeblood by extension.\nEven here, Witchman was contested. He could only pray that his leadership took effect when it mattered most, even if that leadership was bound to tactics and strategy during quests.\nMoving on from this conversation, they went on a quest, pursuing the wind of change.\nThe goblins would be waiting for them.\nWitchman gritted his teeth, understanding that might would make right the injustices Sophia had experienced. It was an illogical, hypocritical thought, but in the end, the results wouldn’t change even if he felt angry with them. Ultimately, adventurers and goblins would engage in a rivalry.\nWitchman and Michel joined Tamer’s waiting group at the guild before they headed via several routes, commuting via wagons and giant crocodiles. They were excited to see the thunderous heights the mountains reached, the reptile legs of their rides making marks across the rainforest floor.\nThey remembered the sky and its beaming light toward them, and in that immersion, they remembered their own infallibility—that of the destiny of adventurers to manifest their wildness upon the world.\nTamer and Michel were friends first before rivals, since they competed in a female ladder, marking the various ways women had it different, even in small ways like a ranking. They worked out being on the same journey easily, as many adventurers had to.\nWitchman prolonged the journey because he wanted to explore and take detours, being one for the organic whispers of this new realm.\nHe saw several goblins taking aim at them, and he was quick toward casting [Whirlwind Waltz] as he got close, afraid of demonstrating his other skills just yet due to their long cooldowns.\nAs soon as the goblins were damaged once, they spread the wings hidden on their backs and flew, shooting at Witchman and the rest of his group.\nWitchman forwent casting [Whirlwind Whirl] when he saw that the goblins were not all within the range of the skill. He could see its range via a holographic sphere around him.\nWitchman’s group took heavy damage, disassembling, as the goblins punished their lack of preparedness to them and their ambush.\nThey and their driver retreated, leaving behind the giant crocodile.\nThe goblins zoned them away in order to capture the crocodile.\nAs soon as they left, Witchman’s group discussed ways they could return. Their red card was not with them, and it wouldn’t have made a difference much since the adventurer guild was too far away.\nThey returned home after a long, torturous journey.\nWitchman was saddened that he was put at such an awkward angle that he couldn’t perform as well as he did at the Fourth Ring. But being on a journey broke his stride compared to having prepared adequately in a generally familiar place.\nIn the city, they went to a bakery and bought some quick food to fill their hungry stomachs, passing through large crowds of people.\nWitchman saw Desmond, but it wasn’t the time to contact him again. They were both still in the middle of something.\nMichel, Tamer, and Witchman parted ways, and the driver who had lost his giant crocodile was compensated with some money from Witchman and Tamer.\nWitchman left to check his current resources and items after he returned to the cottage, noting down several things from his journey. He sighted only one village in the journey, and it was relatively small. However, he did find several different forests, plains, and a mountain range. It was not that far, but his understanding of the place became a little more concrete.\nHe also recalled the information he gathered from listening to Michel, Tamer, and the driver.\nThey mentioned various events: the coincidence between a rise in monster activity in the overall region with the newfound strength of the goblins, the King’s decision to make coffee a luxury good, and the removal of the second adventurer guild where Witchman made his name “Witchman.”\nWitchman had been gone for a while, so the journey was long enough for them to explain everything to him and about what people were saying.\nNaturally, people were mostly negative toward the coffee tax increase, but no one from the main district of the city where the main adventurer guild was cared about the removal of the second adventurer guild. It wasn’t as if Witchman gained anything from it either. He only got shanked by a group of bandits there.\nAs for why the goblins became stronger, people said that it was because of magic laboratories going wrong. So there was an increase in concern regarding them. Research was geared toward finding new solutions for adventurers, so if anything went wrong, people blamed it on them for doing too much or not doing enough. There was this one time where they found a way to make potions better, but it came at the cost of permanently weakening heal magic whenever it was drank. But they also were the reason adventurers could now use the red card without getting sick. It was a mixed bag.\nIn the end, Witchman’s mood improved as well thanks to the journey, marking the start of a new week since he holed himself up for a week.\nHe focused his efforts on listening to the [System]’s regularly supplied quests, since he had been mostly ignoring them because they weren’t relevant to his concerns and that of his friends and associates.\nHe found one relevant quest.\nQuest Name: Investigating the Goblin Menace\nQuest Description: Rumors have been spreading about a new goblin threat led by a powerful leader known as Grimtusk. Reports suggest that these goblins have developed advanced magic spells, making them more dangerous than ever before. Your task is to investigate the source of this goblin resurgence, gather intelligence on their capabilities, and devise a strategy to counter their threat. Be cautious, as encountering Grimtusk and his minions will pose a significant challenge.

Access to valuable information and resources related to goblin magic. Recognition and gratitude from the local authorities for your efforts in protecting the region. Potential discovery of rare loot or artifacts hidden by the goblins.\nChapter 33 - Journey to the Unknown: Exploring Life Beyond the Battleground linkBefore accepting the quest to investigate Grimtusk, Witchman visited several different work places to see how life breathed around there, being one for the masses. He hadn’t expected to see numerous people dressed in various clothes in certain spots, having shied away from getting too involved with the affairs of the cityfolk. Their concerns and their variegated trends were elusively wide and dynamic, so he never had any connection to the commonfolk. But he did wonder if whether learning about how they lived would impact his ability to lead as an adventurer, considering that the new adventurers all recently came from civil life. This was why he hadn’t really gotten involved with the “New Adventurers Division” that the guild had cooked up in order to make it efficient for newbies to receive tasks and delegate it to their fellows. Either way, the influx of adventurers had to be tamed, so if he didn’t participate in any way, that would help out a lot.\nSo he could start by visiting the commonfolk once again. Traveling through the streets like a noble would was only a peek into their actual lives. If he wanted a more in-depth understanding of them, he would need to live and breathe in the same rooms.\nThis was why he entered the work places, asking his fellow senior adventurers if they had anything to do with a civil worker. These adventurers half-joked that he sounded as if he was about to grab someone off the street to give them a day job or contract them for an upcoming land development project, considering Witchman’s history as a quest event mobilizer. Though, Witchman argued that it was a stretch to imagine himself being an industry leader, in view of the minor role event initiators played in the actual organizational process, but he thanked them, concluding that it was a nice gesture anyway.\nAs soon as he came into contact with a worker, particularly a tanner, he asked them regarding their day-to-day affairs, emphasizing the cultural aspects of his day.\nWhen he heard that in his field, people were beginning to forget traditional tanning techniques and opting for newer, more streamlined techniques, he asked them what his thoughts about that were.\nThe tanner said he was disgruntled, having been deprived of his specialty, now that newer generations of tanners were denouncing older techniques as quaint and generic. He wished people could recognize that these techniques didn’t have to be replaced. They could be upgraded with enough magical intention, but people didn’t want to spend their levels and skills with them, fearing that they would only be slowing their progress, when in reality, these older techniques had a much more bigger ecosystem of passed-down knowledge about how to upgrade these techniques via magic. He didn’t speak dismissively against the newer techniques. He just said that older languages of tanning had lasted so long for a reason, but the decline in their usage was leading to them becoming deprecated, significantly impeding further development. He didn’t want to mention the cultural aspects of these older techniques, because it was a done-and-tried talking point already.\nIt was a common concern, one that Witchman didn’t find particularly enlightening. But in light of this new context, he found himself in a state mulling over his existence here in contrast to that of Earth.\nMoreover, he wondered if there were older techniques and ecosystems in magic similar to tanning and if certain adventurers utilized older techniques, because he didn’t know yet the difference between older and newer ones.\nShifting to his overall understanding of magic, it was limited to the skills and the information the [System] gave him. He hadn’t met anyone particularly interested in informing beyond that, but he did wonder if Rodney, his information team, and the skill practitioner knew anything.\nAfter visiting them, he discovered that they didn’t know anything. If that information was exclusive to those of a higher rank, he might understand, but the fact that they were clueless to the inner workings of the [System] made him realize that the city he was in was a very low-level, minor, and small place then relative to the possibilities of the [System].\nHe wanted to set the rules of the playing field, finding the isolated skills and his lack of understanding the broader spectrum that made up the weakest to the strongest. He wasn’t part of a sect to give him a list of skills he needed to learn from “Grade Weakest” to “Grade Strongest,” and even if he was part of a sect that did so, would they tell him everything? The fact that he likely had to do a combination of actions in order to get certain skills made the realm of magic that much more esoteric.\nHe was powerful, but he wasn’t knowledgeable. He had good skills, but that didn’t necessarily mean he understand what he was doing. He was like a noble exploiting a people whose lives he didn’t really comprehend. He was like a king who could never appreciate his wealth because he didn’t grow up from the lowliest of low to the higher of high with a natural progression. He didn’t get the satisfaction of success, which came from that seasoned wealth of experience through progression.\nHe was stuck in limbo, wondering whether his skills were strong or not. But they did make him more capable than the common man back on Earth, so that was his perspective.\nIn the end, it was already 3 months and 1 week into this world, and nothing about this world made any sense to him still.\nHe felt like a fraud playing a perfomance still.\nIt was like being a child going to many places and many events and many things that he didn’t understand, only obeying and believing everything, with a strong but underutilized and undercommunicated cognition.\nHe was a 25-year-old adult reduced to an 11-year-old.\nHe remembered when he first went to camp as an 11-year-old boy. He was smart enough to think many things and to ask many important questions, pushing away the discomfort of encountering negativity and delving deep into connections with kind people, but he was lacking in social skills, communication skills, and confidence. Although he was unevenly skilled, he could respond well and sing on stage, captivating others even as a child. He could do so much, yet he could do so little.\nNow, he was like that boy, but he was an adult. So he could act like an adult, even if he had an inner child. Even then, he felt as vulnerable as he had been as an 11-year-old.\nTime only made things better for him back on Earth, but today, he was a castrated, dewinged, naked angel sitting unevenly against the rocks by a wide, echoing river running along a green mountain.\nHe stood up, granted that he was a human being again capable of what the greats could achieve.\nHe saw a bright hill farther than any horizon could reach. He felt himself on top of that hill and prepared himself with an illustrious smile.\nHe disappeared, never to be seen again.\nHe decided to move to a different city, feeling that it would be healthy for him to break away from the stresses and constant burnout of urban living and working as a top-notch adventurer for their playing field, as in for his level and duration of work. He compared this to an active soldier in an active war at this point. Though, he admitted that he was exaggerating: he didn’t want to jinx himself into getting into an actual thirty-year war.\nHe hadn’t really taken the time to appreciate and savor the new world, always on the heat of battle. Even the most enjoyable moments were outweighed by the beating burnout.\nUltimately, he wanted to live slower instead of living chaotically and so quickly as though he was running everything through a summary report in opposition to being in the poetic, observational, and intimate moment.\nHe had numerous, meaningful complaints about his first city and how much potential was lost in the process, but he let go.\nHe was not the late Sophia’s slave any longer.\nTo honor her memory, he would explain. Sophia did save him, but this made it difficult for him to leave even if he was getting burned out a lot and struggling mentlally. To sum in a morbid way, her passing freed him.\nHe was not necessarily mad at Sophia. It was just that her saving him made it hard for him not to want to pay that debt back, so he stayed even if it was already too difficult for him. He kept on, and indeed, he might have been achieving success. But he was already on the verge of losing it, having made many impulsive decisions already.\nSoon, at the entry of the second week of the third month, an assemblage of adventurers entered the city of Power, their expressions and demeanors steel like the symbol of two burning hammers angled diagonally across each other, forming an X.\nAn adventurer sighted Witchman.\nWitchman wore a large cloak covering his head, accompanied by two others.\nThese two wanted to help him get to the city at least. It made him look less cool, but it was raining season already.\nThe droplets formed puddles, and it got muddy, reminding Witchman of his first time in this world again. He couldn’t stop recalling that time. It was like still having dreams of a long-standing crush 5 years later.\nThe hills were very wet, and the fog was clear.\nThis was a mountainous area.\nThe city welcomed people, showing stalls already at the entrance, covered by an overhang from the top of the walls and gate. These stalls looked more like bunkers with how compact and closed they looked with only a small opening for the both the rushing and patient customers pausing in the middle of the journeys. Several statues loomed above, reflecting the want for symbolism and status even on a mountain.\nThe quiet moments in the mountain were served alongside plates full of fried food, hot soup drinks, and hints of wood in the flavoring due to the wooden bowls used. The nightly shirts men wore were dark violent in color; reflecting their abiding by the street laws of the city, which prioritized maintaining a color theme amid complaints of poverty and other more important concerns. All in all, along with the comforts of this modern life, magic did invite more creative minds that tended toward aesthetic and culture-building to the administration, at least in this instance.\nSoon enough, precious spilled droplets of the ground were consumed magically, being converted to mana for the workers. This was a feature of sustainability supported by an agency within the city administration, one that culturally and economically tied this polity to other sustainability-directed cities. Overall, there existed a network of polities that were all connected via initiatives represented by various individual sustainability installations.\nReturning to the present, Witchman viewed how different people interacted with each other, finding their gestures foreign and intriguing. One would put his hand on his forehead and make an L sign. Another would make a C with his right hand and make a biting motion with it. These were all gestures common in daily conversation, but here, it felt inherent to this city. The voices and accents were different as well; though, he could only describe it as French without the pronounced nasality.\nWitchman came across a large guild that offered civilian jobs.\nThe administration of this city-state had these things called guilds, distinct from adventurer guilds, and they had an open guild in the hotspot of the city at the main road near the main gate where travelers come through. These guilds efficiently brought news, became the concierge or place of meeting for bulk trades between different leaders, and also gave people civilian tasks. It was so streamlined that it was so effective at integrating travelers and migrants into the city with the guild being right in the same path as the main road connected to the main gate where travelers influx through. It immediately set up travelers with a very well-rounded guild to help bring them into the fold and get them working for the city immediately. It wasso streamlined not just infrastructurally for the citizens, but also for migrant integration into the workforce. It was very notable when viewed from Witchman’s perspective, who encountered an ecosystem of support marked by improvisation back in the first city.\nIt was so streamlined because they didn’t have to worry about migrants, seeing them as fresh workers out of the oven.\nAs for the constitutional rationale upon which the migrants were declared a non-issue, one of the city’s key elements was a ubiquitous spell that affected new entrants with a protective and soothing effect until they left the city bounds. This was a buff through and through, because impulsiveness, when viewed as a psychological precursor and symptom—as distinguished even in the [System]’s words—was a classified debuff. Basically, the city was a “migrant city,” that which integrated migrants as a part of its constitution and purpose. But migrants were only one element of a broader streamlined system with regard to employment distribution.\nAs mentioned earlier, the city was on a mountain. But to add to that, they captured a lot of the migrants coming from a particular region like a wet catching fish. They served as a fishing net to stream funds toward the rest of the country, initially purposed as a money machine instead of a city with its own culture. Fortunately, nowadays, it retained very little of that first version of its identity.\nWitchman had yet to learn of all of this, being a particular indiviudal among a flock of travelers. They were here to rest and eat, but less than 1 percent of them would join the guild permanently. This was still a large amount, as the active travelers in this area numbered one thousand everyday. However, 99% of travelers did join the guild for at least a week. This was where the economy really shone.\nAs soon as he joined the guild, he already knew that this place was going to be much more smaller compared to his last city, considering how fast the pace was. Everyone was also younger or around his age here too, mostly people coming from the direction of the region of his last city. As for the reason of this, it had a cone effect when it comes to its reach, good for migrants coming from this region and direction, but bad for people coming from its own broader region because it was closer to a certain border and geographically limited.\nFurthermore, he noticed lots of different magic being used in day to day life to help with tasks, specifically newer magic touted by trends as being superior and innovative. It was easy to find lots of useless trend noise, but when certain magic really struck, it immediately impacted the city.\nThe pace was even faster here, but for different reasons.\nHe just wanted to find a place to stay that wasn’t too crazy, but traveling was dangerous and very challenging on the spirit. He needed this place to recover after he got sick from the rain.\nThe two people accompanying him explained that it was cheap to stay here; though, the residential buildings were divided into residences more akin to cage homes. This was the cost of staying in a business district. Any exclusive residences were too expensive.\nWitchman said that he used to make plenty of money, but he abandoned it after getting burned out with all the responsibilities of adventurer life. It didn’t seem that much when summarizing it in a report, but he lost his life there more than metaphorically. He was not okay. He was only okay when he left the city. He decided that that time was the peak and left. He had to leave on a high, or else he would do something that would shatter all his connections and power in a heartbeat.\nThe two people with him were a friend of the late Marcher and one of the former members of Desmond Leroy’s party. He met them several times and small-talked with them during gatherings, having overheard that they were planning to travel here. So he was the one who initiated their journey party.\nIn the end, he was here to relax and set the tone. He changed the tone of his life once, and he would do it again if push came to shove. No one would stop what he was going to do next.\nChapter 34 - You Will Not Stop Me! linkWitchman’s first goal in the new city was to sit down and discuss everyday, either before or after work, depending on the work schedule, maybe even during work if they found the same task.\nTheir first task at the new guild was to use their magic to attack monsters that spawned inside of a large container. All they had to do was attack the monsters with a spear from an opening below and around the bottom of the container, where the monsters had no way of attacking them.\nThey did this everyday for 3 months, collecting experience and loot. They kept the experience, but they delivered the items to a nearby crate after grabbing the items either by hand if it was close or with a grabber tool, a rake, or rod with a dustpan-looking end. It wasn’t consistent what tool they used, and it didn’t matter to them, except for a few rare pivotal, dangerous instances.\nDuring those three months of adjusting, they were given an opportunity to do other jobs, given that they had proven themselves capable. But they decided to stick to the job.\nAt the end of those three months, Witchman decided to leave since he had saved up enough money to be satisfied, considering that he didn’t want to be an adventurer anymore. But he still wanted to help out as an adventurer would, just not officially under that kind of pressure.\nAt the next city, he and his two companions were surprised to encounter Thorne, Lumi, and Elara—a happy surprise nonetheless.\nAs soon as they caught up, Thorne’s group dragged Witchman’s group to a mountain cave where adventurers were busy preparing for a siege underground where hundreds upon hundreds of dungeons and thousands of structures extended over a large expanse of caverns, chambers, passages forming cave systems—a labyrinthine opportunity.\nBut Witchman knew that even with this context in mind, he would only tend to the small tasks distributed and offered candidly to migrant workers, cottagers, and day laborers willing to make a living even within the periphery of the campaign. War was profitable, and it trickled down, providing the nearby communities with hundreds of new job opportunities.\nWitchman was given the role of a warder’s assistant, helping out with menial concerns that arose due to the warder’s unfamiliarity and lack of experience with the surrounding area. So he was made to collect information on the environment that would usually slip past the focus of the warders, their commitment entrenched in generalized combat. Overall, Witchman was part of a network designed to address logistical challenges, gather intelligence, and provide personalized communication channels; in addition to handling nuances introduced by their unique environment and circumstances—which lay peripheral to their combat and combat-adjacent priorities but nonetheless remained essential to the operation—and attending to disruptions that occurred regularly on the various pathways of the operation.\nThanks to his past experience as a warder and an event initiator, he was effective in bridging the gap between the warding profession and his fellow personnel.\nAdditionally, Witchman understood all of this, having been part of many circumstances and instances similar to these. With time, he began advancing through the ranks by asking tactfully for more responsibilities due to his diligence, patronage via Thorne, Lumi, and Elara, and his talent in administration.\nEven if he didn’t want to be a combatant, he effectively became an unelected officer carrying a deep effect when it came to the outcome of the war and larger campaign.\nOnly a year later, Witchman sat down, donning a purple tunic indicating his status and and a yellow surcoat. His eyes passed from one person to the next, taking in the view of the throne. He wasn’t here to argue about the problems of warfare or the atrocities executed against goblins. He was only here to bathe in the feeling of righteousness this seat afforded him.\nIt didn’t matter though. His time was over.\nHe stood up and left, heading to his estate to take a bath.\nThere, he rested his eyes and his spirit, imagining himself back there again a year and three months back. If his past self saw him now, he would be happy, but he wasn’t entirely content.\nIt was his growing frustration that led him to power and led him to high places. It was what brought him to grace and into beauty. He was the epitome of it all, tearing through the flesh of his enemies and castrating them all the way to the bone. He shone himself, reveling in the momentary self-praises in his head.\nEven after everything, he was bottomless, and he was craving like a goblin eating human flesh.\nReturning to the present, around a year and a half ago, where the future was not fixed and anything could happen, he watched his two companions and their expressions, as they looked at their clothes and things. This was around the time they first entered the second city. “What did you guys plan on doing?”” he said. “Washing up things?”\nHe didn’t know what was going to happen to him, but he knew that he had to find a way to get things together.\nHe was already feeling a little down after leaving his friends back at his first city, which was known in this new city as “Emerald Haven” due to how green it looked from a bird’s eye view.\nIf he could go back, then maybe things would be better, but his two companions, Elena and Liam, convinced him again and again to keep on keeping on.\nShifting to the outside, the streets lit up explosively with a million lights by the time that it was evening, directing his attention to the quiet voices of the children outside.\nAnything could happen, but Witchman was in the here and now.\nHe decided to take on a new name when he signed up at the guild, choosing the rough, self-deprecating name “Scrappy.”\nHe cleared out his head.\nTwo groups of children saw him standing outside an inn, his posture that of a lost man looking for shelter.\nThey went to him, being a group of skilled mages on their own turf, and asked if he was okay.\nScrappy, covering his face, shook his head, saying that he recently lost his friends. He didn’t have anyone else to talk to, so why not a group of unsuspecting children with much to learn?\nThe children asked if he wanted a place to stay.\nScrappy nodded, although his eyes betrayed his allegiance to the inn.\nThe children nodded to each other and agreed that it was a good idea to help him find a place to stay, even if it wasn’t at an inn.\nWhen Scrappy, who reluctantly accepted the food he was given, arrived at the place the children had in mind for him, he was distraught to see a group of men eating at a table. “What is this? A homeless shelter?” He looked around, finding the women and children eating at a corner on a much more elegant table than the men’s. He became relieved in light of the casual mood. “This feels like a good place to be in,” he said, his voice weak yet geared toward admiration. “Why did you guys allow me to come here?”\nThe children said that they were tasked with getting “the lost people” out of the streets.\nScrappy wondered if what their motives were and asked indirectly about it.\nThe children explained that it was part of the city’s initiatives to separate the population into distinct groups to make it easier to organize. So shelters provided one effective incentive for people to cooperate. Though, the efforts were much more comprehensive than that. Basically, people were being separated for two reasons. One, magic was hard to manage and control. Two, the ubiquitous magic that protected and calmed the citizens was not perfectly reliable and stable as a solution. As a consequence, sometimes, the bottled-up emotions of people would erupt instead of being soothed, leading to magical altercations that resulted in injury or death. As for the primary causes of these altercations, the nature of the city’s infrastructure made it challenging for people to feel comfortable. This was why the ubiquitous magic was essential to the city’s functioning, because the infrastructure-catalyzed stress led to potentially lethal fights. Overall, facilitating the separation of people who were already willing to forge their own little communities with friends, families, and other people from the same culture and language was their main goal.\nShifting to the notability of this explanation, thanks to magic-assisted education, these children were given the opportunity to receive edification to this extent. Moreover, the common sight of groups of children walking the streets at night could be interpreted culturally to suggest a more sophisticated society.\nScrappy was happy to find people on the same turf as he was in terms of a more formally educated culture, since most of his life had been dedicated to that area of interest.\nDefinitely, it was challenging to live in a more physical way and rely on physical-based systems that disputed the use of strategy and more economical streams of thought and diverted them toward the creatives.\nThis was one of his critiques of Emerald Haven’s priorities. Though, he might be wrong regarding this, given the arduous circumstances upon which his cognition had been contingent.\nHe relinquished his thought processes for a moment and looked at the children, thanking them with a smile.\n“It’s cool, you know…” He waited for them to show inclined interest.\n“Everything you’re doing here…” He switched up the tone. “If it’s not too much to ask, may I get your… name? I’m not really that… worried… about… the things that are happening…” He saw the shy expressions of the other people inside the shelter. “I mean, let… me know… if you guys are looking for someone… anyone—you know—that can be do something possibly…?” He was especially roundabout himself.\nThe children casually affirmed what he said, adding that others like them would be patrolling around the area at night, even if it was raining. And these other enlished personnel within their organization shared information with them, so they would know about his interest in joining.\nScrappy expressed a smile first before bowing, not sure how to respond when the people in the shelter gave him an applause. It was a strange response, so he brushed it off for now as a trinket of their culture.\nLater, he returned to the inn, remeeting his two original companions. “Elena, what happened with the ‘compartmenters’? Liam, what’s the case with the soldiers at the north border? Did they really do it?”\nHe was interested in getting to know what happened, given that he heard them speaking about it a while ago.\nElena and Liam knew more about this city more than he did, so they enticed him with hints of an expanding world.\nWith a smile, Elena slowly began taking off her mask, putting it down and embracing Liam. They were friends, but they were also “siblings” in a pact, having gone through the same trial by fire and emerged with a newfound sense of purpose. They used to be part of a secret society that offered ways to regenerate limbs through magic, and they were able to do so, having lost their memories as a result. This was why even now, they were intelligent, because their mind was as fresh as a child and as cognitively mature as an adult in a magically strong manner, making it so that they learned things like a sponge. This made them effective companions during village visitations with their late friend Marcher. And now, they were extending that same skill set to Scrappy, who was previously a friend of Marcher as well. In the end, Scrappy, Liam, and Elena were simply here to visit, but they each held grandiose plans in store.\nTheir night was quiet, leaving only the sounds of mice roaming through the streets, cats chasing them, and dogs marking their territory. It was an urban animal hotspot.\nElena and LIam were curious mouth-breathers who enjoyed a good pet, so they adopted one out of the street and placed them in a cage in the same room as Scrappy.\nScrappy was fine with that, considering his new ties and bond to the nearby shelter.\nIf he wanted to elevate his position further, he had to start with something as grounded as the shelter. This was why, even while Elena and Liam were pursuing diverse interest, including that of work in the guild, he was hunting down each individual within the shelter since they didn’t stay there all the time and would go out in the morning. It was only in the night when they slept there on the floor. It was a humble abode for lost boys and girls.\nOn one occasion, he greeted a man wearing a saddleback tunic, his smile like that of a man receiving sexual pleasure. It was only when Scrappy saw the way he walked that he realized that the man was emphatically humorous, having been birthed from a cross between a theatre jester and a man inhaling copious amounts of energy-boosting stimulants. He even would ran around as if he was tearing through the air, seeking out food from various day jobs. In the end, to the dismay of some, to the delight of many—along with his more comprehensive traits—he embodied the role of a high-functioning weirdo.\nThis was only one occasion. He met several other people, and he met the same men on different occasions, seeing them in different angles and in their various self-representations. It was like observing dogs act differently when in different quarters of the house. Surprising! Incredulous! Terrifying! Manifesting!\nHe wanted to take in, like money to a banker, the people and the whims they sought. If he could grab the lace that set them free, he would manipulate them to his own ends, and that wasn’t free. It took effort and commitment, but he was also an ethical actor. So he would have to contend with his own spirit first. Amen.\nHe now had the justification to make light out of any man he would see. But he was only joking.\nMaybe, he finally had a place, one where the shelter provided a sense that he could engage in the most trivial things and still find a sense of purpose and camaraderie. He enjoyed the thought of putting himself in their shoes, knowing that whatever their struggles were, it was inevitable that he would share them in part, being their friends—souls on the same grassy field.\nHe realized one pursuit—that of baring the shelter’s individuals.\nHe memorized them by name—listing 15 individuals among the men, 20 individuals among the women, and 13 individuals among the children, which varied by boy and girl. He thought they were hard to forget—this was logical estimate.\nHe couldn’t get rid of their influence on his heart and mental wellbeing, and any analysis turned out to be a gesture of his own humanity. He loved them for who they were, not for their benefit toward him, but for the sense that they were all gathered here in a shared grace.\nHe stopped himself tentatively, wishing that maybe he was wrong about everything. Based on probability, he could turn himself inside and out into something that betrayed his previous ideas propagandized by adventuring toward the world. He had become free from all of that, free from bias, free from control.\nBut he was here, the leaves tickling his person. Even here, he was attended by forces outside of his control, those willing to direct his behavior. He didn’t have anything left really to oppose. It was all a matter of subjective perspective.\nIf he wanted to fight, he would destroy.\nIf he wanted to create, he would bring life through empathy and love.\nMaybe, that was a false dillema. Maybe, he could run away and avoid the complexity of his problems.\nIn here, he was safe. Was that not enough?\nTo be happy, to be secure, and to be readied for a higher purpose beyond himself?\nHe didn’t have anything against the world. He only had something against the feeling of pain inside him.\nMaybe, he was depressed, struggling against thoughts that convinced him he was wrong in the realm of inherence. He was stupid in the realm of nature. He was broken in the realm of infinity.\nHe didn’t have anything left to say.\nHe was tired of pretending to be someone, but did he know what else guided him beyond his own thoughts? No.\n“Everything around him” was a sufficient enough description, but it never detailed the factors and the everything.\nHe was lost in his own way, tied down, freed to the point of imprisonment.\nHe didn’t know what he was saying anymore.\nHe smiled because that was all that made sense.\nHis goals and purpose here and his reason for leaving were all arbitrary according to himself. He set the tone and the things that happened next, and then everything fell apart anyway. In the shambles and the rubble, he arose a second time, a third, and a fourth up to infinity. He would become the epitome of grace. He would become the epitome of beauty.\nHe was the Great I Am.\nHe stared at the people around him and silently whispered into the air, leaving a message that generations would follow.\nThe next thing he would do next was go to the adventurer guild and defeat his purpose for being here.\nIf things made sense, he would dismantle them like the dogs they were! Because nothing ever made sense. If it did, something was wrong. His life had been rinse-and-repeat torture! Was he just a man waiting to die before the looming shadow of death? He cried: “Abba. Please save me. I am just a frail man!”\nBut he was not! He denied.\nHe was a vengeful soul reaping the joys of his beloved and turning their memories into a fiery flame gushing out in an ever-consuming fire.\nHe didn’t have a soul yet. Maybe…\nHe did now.\nHe smirked, readying himself for physical massacring.\nChapter 35 - The Prodigal Adventurer Returns linkFor more than three months, Scrappy was thrust into the adventuring pattern, living in camaraderie with adventurers, and so he was here now, having left his first city in this new world. As mentioned before, he came from Earth and was transported to this fantasy world with a traumatic start of being tortured by goblins and then saved and brought into the first city by adventurers. As for the reason he left, he wanted to be free from the burnout and stress and ethical split regarding the killing of alive goblins. Moreover, he joined the adventurers and became an adventurer himself, tied by his obligation toward Sophia, the healer who healed him and saved his life first and foremost. When she died, he finally gave himself the license to leave, even after going on so many adventurers and quests, meeting many people and developing connections with them, and living an all-around successful life in his adventurer career. To further surprise and development, after staying here at the new city, he decided again to return to the adventuring ways, even after experiencing new joy with the shelter people and being almost immediately supported by state actors. This betrayed his desire for a sense of control, while also affirming it. It showed that he did change, but now, he was claiming the adventurer identity as his. To explain his positive reasons for returning, it gave him an unprecedented deep sense of purpose, fulfillment, belonging, and validation, motivations reinforced time and time again against by time prolonged there. Also, he had unresolved issues with it. Besides, externally, people all around him still—whether they were kind, nice, bad, or evil—gave him a sense that he had to purchase time, money, and skill with effort rapidly. And the only way to do that in his mind was to seize them, and adventuring represented that definitive pathway to victory. He had made it clear that nothing ever made sense, but this. This truly made sense.\nHe was calm, knowing his bounds. Every step was measured, and his footsteps would always exhibit that sense of longing. If not for the fact that he was doing it on purpose to give people a sense that he had a destination in mind all the time every time he walked, it would have just been an emotion.\nBut all in all, he was completely in self-control, determining his path to victory. But time was a bitter female dog, always mocking his actions and his attitude, telling him nothing made sense.\nBut he would cast the lot. He would turn the tides. He would remove whatever barrier was in his way. He was not naught. He was something. “Damn it!” he said, his voice whispered, enough that no one would ever be able to tell that he was a controlling freak.\nHe grabbed the way of the world, and he twisted it with his own hands.\nAnd the best way to do that was by using one of this world’s greatest tools—the prodigal son of adventure, restored to realization that this was remarkable.\nHe had been given God’s gifts of love, authority, and pleasure.\nHe was sure that he had been given a hand in the things of life and death.\nIt was only now that he finally reached justification and a perfect rationale behind his actions.\nHe slashed the goblin devil.\nHe rendered the goblins formless, turning their flesh askew.\nLeveling up only symbolized his retreat to glory—a restful retreat, a savagely pleasant glade, a nicely put, prancing lot where his mind was at ease.\nHe cut down the goblin enforcer of control and authority, slashing his angelic outline and reverbrating into his soul. He caused it to dissipate.\nHe walked aside.\nAnother goblin moved, the shadowy figure adjusting its posture, readying to fight. It wanted to see the farthest light slashed in half, because Scrappy was that light, his armor reflecting the shining, blue flowers of the cave deeper within.\nA goblin fell to the hurt, his face disfigured and caused to become astray in its details. It knew no more wealth and growth, only deterioration.\nA sword sank to the bottom of the sea that made up the goblin’s organs and being.\nThe man Scrappy was too elated to hate. He was just functional and purposeful in his actions.\nThe night showed no mercy to monsters, especially when Scrappy was divinely inspired. Even if it was not actual divinity, the god-like being [System] inspired him.\nWith a squealing blade, the goblin expressed itself, his sword then bouncing off. But it was a “he,” and he was an “it.” It didn’t matter.\nHis sword fell to the side, revealing his awkward smile.\nHis smile was ripped apart. That smile was a mockery of functionality.\nScrappy needed more reclamation.\nTo that end, he slashed repeatedly on a musical count.\nThe timing was off, and the pitch was the sword twanging all over the place. In the end, it represented his rhythm of warfare, that which cast aside all unnecessary elements—emotion, faces of disgust, puking upon the earth. A sense that everything was lost lay in that ravenous hunt.\nThe showers of praise upon his being became apparent.\nGreat job on defeating that solo goblin! Your expertise nets you a solid 7+ XP! 🎉\nWell done on taking down that armored goblin! Your victory earns you a hefty 42+ XP! 🎉\nHe lacerated a single armored goblin three times consecutively, breaking its restarting momentum the same number of times. It was a familiar technique, which worked into his rhythm instinctively.\nIt was the same pace and the same beat here, but it wasn’t the same person.\nSlashing right and left, up and down, the movements were solid, rock-heavily banging the temples to the off position, the cracks simulating a web.\nA combo-driven expanse of attacks thrust from his being, even when his sword looked uninvolved.\nThe goblins pitiably drifted apart, reacting to the hits and adjusting their feet. The grabbing of the ground by the toes immediately repelled any sense of imbalance and got them working together again. This was their finale.\nHe was unstoppable.\nThe goblins ran, charging with all their might.\nThe sword drifted, shuffling, sounding the swift winds of fjords, breaking the fast for blood.\nGoblins spun, running around; their bodies flew in the air; the soul exploded; their eyes lolled around, their imaginations still; and their bodies expired.\nThe master of swords was driven not by hate, but by the need to cast aside any other thought except redemption. To repeat, he had finally redeemed himself, but he was wrong about being a master. He was just an amateur; it was only here that he appeared to be one of the greatest, not because of his sword skills, but because of his form of heart, basically the way he expressed himself.\nHe inhaled, watching the fallen move their last series of frames.\nHe guessed he was still capable, though in a kidding manner. “Heh.”\nSelf-discovery was a key reason for his time spent here. It was a good thing he actually made something out of himself. Though, he did wonder if he could do something else to pass the time, something more worth his head space. Goblins were great, but not the only thing around here. He thought to look for skeletons. Maybe, they were better.\nScrappy realized something. He had spent so long in contemplation and self-discovery that he had lost track of his two companions. So once he left the cave, he returned to the city and waited for them outside the inn where they lived. Incidentally, he was concerned that the dog in the cage would get out if he was in the inn room.\nSubsequently, when Liam and Elena sighted him on their way to the inn, they were elated, embracing him as a polite gesture and revealing their new wedding plan.\nScrappy was starting to see a pattern here, bobbing his head back with subdued incredulity. At this point, he lampooned himself for expecting anything else even. For context, Deathbringer and the late Sophia, his earliest and closest friends back at his first city and in this new world, married each other. Since Sophia’s passing, Scrappy was very quiet about it, even toward Deathbringer that part of him felt guilty about leaving the city straight without much of a message. He only said bye once without hinting that he was leaving so soon. In the end, a funny marriage pattern was found with regretful vestiges of loss and unfulfilled friendships.\nPassing focus to Liam and Elena, he asked them about their day, excluding the wedding plan they mentioned, hoping to rid himself of his depression.\n“There’s been a new city plan to organize the goblins trap. Maybe, we should join there, you, Liam, and I three. I’m thinking… if we get there before anyone else, we would get first dibs on whatever rewards are waiting for us at the top.”\n“What do you mean? I haven’t started working yet, and you guys are employed… what are you guys doing now?”\n“Fixing latrine holes!” Liam said first to Elena’s dismay.\nElena was characteristically proud of this job, being one for the latrines; though, in truth, it was because latrines were so high-tech to her compared to the squat toilets they were made to defecate in. In conclusion, it was a cultural combination forming a weird response.\nScrappy smiled, though with a tired face. “Yeah? Okay? But I haven’t started working yet! What should I do!” He was complaining among friends.\n“Just come with us then,” Liam said. “The goblins trap is the best thing right now. We should try it!” He made an operatic sound of celebration.\n“What is that even?” Scrappy said with a drawl.\n“It’s where monsters—goblins in this case—spawn, and all we have to do is kill them! And we don’t even have to try!”\nScrappy squinted, finding their reaction strangely emphatic. It excited him. “What do you mean?” His voice showed hints of that excitement.\nLiam smiled with a smirking face. “We just hit their toes, and they die.”\nScrappy reeled his head back, his jaw dropping. “Huh!” He wanted to repeat huh several times, but he saw several passersby awkwardly glancing at him.\nElena popped in like a cherry, sniping a yeah toward the periphery. Simply, she said yeah.\nSitting down on a retaining wall belonging to a raised flower bed, Scrappy rested his chin on his hand, genuinely tired, but vibrating with excitement, which was obvious from his rocking right leg. “I don’t understand.”\nLiam began heading inside the inn, passing by two dwarves and two half-orcs, who were similar in gait and demeanor. “Then come and see! But tomorrow.”\nScrappy gave a resolute thumbs-up. “Alright.”\nElena rotated her head to the side until it was almost horizontal. It sounded weird, but it was an act-cute gesture. “You’re coming?”\nScrappy was so tired he was just droning at this point: “Yeah, sure. Sure! Sure…” Certainly, he got the dog in him, but said dog suffered from respiratory complications.\nReverting to the main point, he followed them inside like a bat in daylight.\nIt embittered him to think that nothing left could be said about his situation, but that was all there was. This was all his perspective brought him at the moment, and anything else beyond this was a vast interconnected, dynamic world.\nInside the inn, hundreds of adventurers and various travelers were seated, engaged in a long conversation. Many of these adventurers were those preoccupied with ideals of victory and championing the feat of adventure, as per usual. Contrastingly, some of them had higher goals involving supporting their friends and family and taking care of their children. Even if it was not as grandiose, they were still a fundamental aspect of civilization, the father of all their endeavors. This was why even if many stoic, hard-fisted adventurers had the capacity to advance to the upper ranks, their desire to deal with lower-level concerns, those more attached to the modern day and the everyday—wherein the bottom pyramid stretched across millions of lives instead of being castrated, limited, and embittered by the loneliness at the top—precluded this. To conclude, while high-stakes adventuring was a worthwhile endeavor, the putative “unambitious” were fundamental to the workings of inner society.\nDividing this discussion into an even more explicitly philosophical portion, “The Collective taketh Place over the Simple,” was a popular quote passed around by philosophizing policymakers. This was especially underpinning, in view of the knowledge that the actions of persons resolutely commanded the after-and-before of human peoples alike. Furthermore, these persons would have happened to be in the crucible of high places and the power to change the pendulum of societal maturation. In closing, the will to ascend conserved by the “high elves” (“the Simple”) among adventurers lay orthogonal to the decisions (“the Place”) made by policymakers; indeed, the lowly (“the Collective”) had their decisional piece of the pie.\nReturning to more immediate concerns, Scrappy was aware of these considerations, having tinkered with his standpoint upon the matter of this world. To stamp this on a more practical floor, this theory-work provided a basis for magical and combat endeavors, owning to their allegiance to the more cerebral-adjacent factors starkly integral to their effectiveness.\nTo prove the practicality of this feat, Scrappy was already begining to sense his first mana whispers, having correlated a high density of theoretical concepts together with the aim of improving his cognitive abilities. This refined cognition, since his time back in college on Earth up to his many reflections in this world, had yet to reap the rewards it brought to the table.\nScrappy noticed his first skill [Whirlwind Waltz] slowly becoming more concrete in his senses. Even now, the sense of proprioception along with hand-to-eye coordination, among other senses and cognitive functions, converged cognitively to form a unitary amount.\n+10 XP for improving your cognition by 10% over the course of three months and two weeks. This message will be the first of many cognitive checks to verify and celebrate your efforts. Continue to be productive, hard worker!\nEven the [System] messages were shifting stylistically in response to this new gamified aspect.\nEven if the experience given was small, his hard work did bear fruit. He would never have to pick up 200 flowers, 200 leaves, 200 fruits, and 200 vegetables without swearing ever again maybe. To clarify, this series of actions was the requirement for completing the kindness quest. As for its rewards, at the time of completion, it gave him his current magical healing skill that wasn’t classified as a skill and that he continued to use to the present day.\nWhen he was alone and out of anyone’s earshot and view, he raised his hand and first made a wrinkly expression before sniffling, then huffing for a few seconds, before sniffing, his jaw trembling, then raising his head, looking up with a clearing face. He smiled with a worried look. He grinned before snickering and then bursting into a series of guffaw-like sounds. He exploded into hysterical laughter, heroically cavernous in sound. “I can’t believe it! I did it!” His hands were so excited, having slain goblins again. It made him so nervous, yet it was so good.\nHe raised a weapon, taking the deepest breath with wide eyes and a subtle smile. And his face contorted, wearing his emotions—volatile frustration and mania-resembling freneticism—like deep creases on a mountain.\n“I am not… that guy.” Despite his claim of weakness, his confidence was reaching red levels.\nHe wore a self-satisfied smirk. He laughed, chuckling. “You seriously think that I, me, myself would lost to anything! Ha! When that day happened, it will, it will! Hahaha! It will happen! But I will be God. I will be epitome of grace and beauty! I will be Me! Epitome! Do you understand. Do you see the greatness that I am! I am everything that this world has been so forlorn to extradite. I’m so, so sorry that this, this is all just a big humor. Ha! I am all gone, all gone! This is all gonna go away. I am gonna disappear! You see! You see! I am just a man! A human being! Nothing special! But don’t you see how awesome, how great, how marvelous! It’s so e-pi-to-me! I am invulnerably delicious! Kill me now! Because I will not die!” He was so excited for his death because the greatest that he was would fall on that day, but until that day, he would ravenously murder the generations upon this earth because he was divine. He was the regeneration of the hosts of the sky.\nSlapping this monologue away and re-moving to a more objective perspective, he was experiencing mania’s grandiose delusions. All this time, he had bipolar I disorder with psychotic features, and his intellect could be considered to be hampered (or benefitted) by it. It was covertly overshadowed by other more diagnosable conditions like trauma and grief, but it had been present in regulated amounts throughout his life. Displacement into this new world made it easier for this kind of psychological break.\nReturning to him, Scrappy grinned, making his way to the dungeon with a shuffling gait. No one could stop him.\nHe had to be stopped. The [System] appeared, accompanying him. Shit.\nChapter 36 - The Epitome of Grace and Beauty linkMatthew/Witchman/Scrappy stood up in front of the [System], saying, “What is it?”\nThe [System] opened his cloak and showed Matthew a floating holographic screen that featured a carnival-colored wheel that one spun to receive a random prize.\n“Just pick one… I want you to see exactly what you’re doing—” the [System] said.\n“This isn’t fair,” Scrappy said. “Why do I get special attention?”\n“The gods marked you remember?” said the [System].\nHe showed Scrappy one of his earlier notifications.\nNice job rocking that fight! The gods are totally keeping an eye on you! 😇 Your reward? Way more XP than usual—12,000+!\n“How does that change anything? What’s so special about me? He said that, but he didn’t actually think so normal as to feel encumbered. In fact, he was demonstrably ready to enact his will at any time. The fight was on.\n“Can you explain?” he continued.\nThe [System] smiled with a head tilt. “You can try spinning it, and then let’s see then.”\nEven now, when Scrappy turned the wheel, he wasn’t hindered at all by his mental conditions, because the symptoms were never as clear-cut. He was high-functioning basically, at least in the context of this world.\nThe [System] grew impatient. “Can you please spin the wheel again?”\nHe tried again.\nThe options were clear.\n**“Dragon’s Breath Blade” - a sword forged from the scales of a dragon, dealing fire damage with each strike and granting the wielder increased resistance to fire attacks. **\n“Master’s Insight” - a consumable item that grants the player 5 additional skill points to allocate to their character’s abilities, allowing them to further specialize in their chosen playstyle.\n“Celestial Steed” - a majestic horse mount with customizable armor and a selection of magical auras, allowing players to personalize their mount’s appearance and abilities.\n“Shadow Assassin Outfit” - a sleek and stylish costume that gives the player’s character a dark and mysterious appearance, along with unique animations and emotes.\n“The Forbidden Crypt” - a hidden dungeon filled with powerful enemies and valuable treasures, accessible only to those who possess a special key obtained as a reward.\n“Bag of Gold” - a large sack filled with a thousand gold coins, providing the player with a substantial amount of currency to spend on items, upgrades, or services.\n“Champion of the Elves” - a title bestowed upon players who reach revered status with the Elven faction, granting access to exclusive vendors selling rare elven weapons and armor.\n“Elixir of the Ancients” - a magical potion that temporarily doubles the player’s experience gain for 24 hours, allowing them to level up faster and progress through the game more quickly.\nPlayer Housing or Strongholds: “Castle Keep” - a grand fortress located in a remote corner of the game world, complete with customizable interiors, expansive gardens, and a private armory.\nExclusive Titles or Achievements: “Legendary Hero” - a prestigious title awarded to players who complete a series of challenging quests, defeat powerful bosses, and earn the admiration of NPCs throughout the game world.\nThis was the first time he saw the word “player” used in the [System]. “Excuse me… are we in a game? I know we had the [System], you. But I’ve never seen this before.” He pointed to the word “player” on the screen. The game terminology was scaring him.\nThe [System] stared at him. “How long have you been here?”\n“3 months and 2 weeks…”\n“Do you think it’s a long enough time for you to know?”\n“I don’t know…”\n“Do you really want to know?”\n“No… Yes…”\n“Tell me.”\n“Yes…”\n“So you’re not in a video game, but it is similar to it.”\n“Thank God…”\nThe wheel stopped.\n“Shadow Assassin Outfit” - a sleek and stylish costume that gives the player’s character a dark and mysterious appearance, along with unique animations and emotes.\n“Can you make purple and yellow?”\nThe [System] smirked before snorting. “Sure…”\nWhen Scrappy donned the outfit, he immediately felt nothing.\nHe realized that it didn’t matter. It never mattered what weapon or armor he used.\nThe only thing that mattered was that he was here.\nHe went to the dungeon, raising a blade.\nHe grabbed a squeling juvenile goblin. “Please, please,” it screamed.\nGoblins never screamed in his life. They didn’t need to, and he didn’t need to hear them.\nThis whole time, they had been speaking.\nBut the realm of the adventurers never cared.\nHe plunged his hands toward their spine through the blade. “I am the epitome of grace and beauty,” he whispered repeatedly, his voice shaking and with a hint of timidity. But that fear was not of guilt or the potential damage from goblins. It was from the sense that his humanity was breaking away.\nHe slashed, giving his all, his eyes blinking. When the blades hit, it slowed.\nThe blade set them free!\nThe goblins flew, wings guiding their flight to heavenly places. It hit the wall and fell, thudding lifelessly.\nScrappy raised his hand, his outfit bearing its fangs. “I am no man. I am God.”\n🌟 You’ve summoned light from the shadows! +1 goblin rescued! +20 XP\n🎉 Hooray! You’ve banished the darkness! +1 goblin liberated! +20 XP\n🌈 Congratulations!

He stared at the person staring at him now.\nThe [System] stepped in, clapping, before looking at the person staring at him now.\nThey smiled, nodding at each other.\nMeanwhile, a goblin ran his hands through his fair with frustration. “We lost them, Ma. We lost them!” His voice was hoarse and granular. “I can’t do this anymore, Ma… I can’t do this!”\nThe goblins were gathered inside a bunker-like cave. “What do we do?” said one of the goblins. “I haven’t seen them yet. What do we do?”\nThe leader, who hadn’t been answering the whole time, smiled with grief coloring his expression. “We move forward… That’s we goblins do.”\nA scream emerged. Several goblins went outside, seeing the marching wave of adventurers toward them.\n“Damn it!” swore the goblins.\n“No!”\n“I can’t do this anymore!” One goblin said, bolting away, deserting the fight.\nThe goblins stared at him and then at each other before grabbing a crossbow and shooting at the deserter.\nThe deserter fell, hitting his head on a rock, his body adjusting itself lifelessly.\nA wail of pain reached the whole goblin group.\nHundreds, if not thousands, would be dead by tomorrow.\nThe adventurers stared with a smirk on their faces, raising their arms in superiority. “We are the adventurers! We will destroy your lands!”\nThe goblins only heard what they wanted to hear: “Hope! We have hope!”\nOne of the adventurers laughed, mirroing Scrappy’s laugh at the sight of his bloody blade 30 kilometers away.\nSwitching to Scrappy, he saw that he couldn’t hide it anymore. He was too much of himself, so he had to cut it off. He grabbed the blade and wished that he was wrong about everything and stabbed himself. He bled. “I am not good enough, aren’t I?” He smiled with sureness. “I really am not… am I?” He burst into a grieving guffaw.\nHe knew who he was, and he knew that he had been doing things that he didn’t want to do. But his compartmentalization had gone too far for him to see even. Each time he tried to think, he was already beating a goblin senseless. He burst into gaiety.\n“I can only keep going.”\nHis statement echoed that of the goblins in the fight 30 kilometers away.\nScrappy raised his hand in the air, reaching for the sky. He was limited, even if he was top 1. He lost everything in the process, and no one could see him anymore. He was not there.\nHe was an empty vessel: his soul had gone away, off back on Earth with his friends and family. He wished that were the case. He believed it. He hoped he would.\nHe cried.\nHe apologized for doing such a horrible thing.\nIt was too late.\nHe realized that his thoughts had deviated from the norm, because the new norm of this world had set the tones many times over.\nHe was incapable of expressing himself in a way that didn’t feel like a mirroring of this world’s adventurers. He was utterly them, and they were him. He was inextricable from them.\nThey were altogether lovely.\nHe begged for mercy. It was not the world he directed it to. It was not people.\nIt was himself.\nWhile others couldn’t stop him, he couldn’t stop himself.\n“It’s too late. I already tried to die. I can’t stop myself. I can’t… I don’t feel depressed anymore. I only feel this great frustration. I have to become better. I have to become confident because helping others needed confidence. I have to help others—No!” He sustained his scream.\nHe realized the blood on his hands were real.\nHe couldn’t stop himself from doing things.\nHe did it again! He did it again! His addiction to the feeling of hope made him do it!\nHe couldn’t stop himself.\nHe couldn’t stop himself.\nHe couldn’t stop himself.\nHe smiled and smirked, shaking.\nHe would become the epitome of grace and beauty.\nHe stood up and became the hypocritical murderer that the people staring at him called him.\nHe would fulfill the expectations of others.\nHe was a people-pleaser after all.\nHe raged upon the streets of Zaun, crushing the goblin foe. He would render their forms formless and cause their lives to be upturned and upended. He lived the whole life, and he was freedom. He was the epitome of grace and beauty.\nHe grinned, his head shaking with adrenaline.\nHe raised his blade, seeing the glory of the light, before smashing down.\nHe created life from the darkness.\nGoblins ran for life, and they spoke life from their fingertips, as they aimed their bows of love toward his angelic person.\nHe accepted them all and fell to the earth, weakened, bleeding.\nHe healed himself, but the arrows had struck deep and penetrated through his body with large exit wounds. He realized he was dying.\nHis skill had been used already in the previous fight.\nHe cried, longing for Mommy. He missed his brothers.\nHe wished that he was sorry, because he felt no guilt, only excruciating pain.\nHe died.\nHe loved the world, but he couldn’t love himself.\nChapter 37 - F*cking Finally! link[The System] stared at Matthew’s lifeless body. “I know it’s unjust, but should we just give him a second chance…” Their conversation continued long.\nAfterwards, [The System] grabbed Matthew and raised him, his body dangling like a wheat stalk in the windy rain. “Why…”\nHe plunged his hand through his heart and made it beat again. After healing him, he sat on his haunches and waited, balancing himself every so often due to the muscle strength required to uphold that posture.\nMatthew got up later, his eyes opening slowly and with contemplation. “I know I died. I felt myself dead, but I know now that I am alive. What is it that I am?” What he meant to say was that he wanted to know what the purpose [The System] had for him. “I died fairly. You shouldn’t have gone ahead and broke the cycle of life.”\n“Who sets the rules, huh? I do. This is a new world, and you will work hard for me whether you like it or not.”\nMatthew glanced to the side, exhaling with resignation.\n“It’s nice to be back.” A smile played on his lips.\n“See, all you needed was a good sleep, and now here you are!” [The System] stood up with newfound energy, beckoning Matthew to follow him.\nThey walked away, passing by hundreds of bodies and the adventurers walking around. They couldn’t see [The System]. They only saw Matthew crazily talking out loud. So they didn’t mind him too much, too preoccupied with getting the loot to the wagons.\nAfter leaving the area, they arrived at a small hut. “Sit down,” [The System] said. “Relax. Let’s prepare for tomorrow. Get some rest. Good sleep. As long as you’re okay, we can proceed with your next plan.”\nMatthew gave a strong smile before it weakened. “Thank you…”\nWhen [The System] left, he delved into contemplation. Why didn’t the [The System] numb his emotions and let him get himself killed? He did that once. Why didn’t he do it again? Why did the [The System] save him? Did he go against the rules of this world by reviving him? What would happen next? He didn’t want to be left out in the details.\nHis mind processed things, soon returning to a sense of cognitive stability.\nBut the questions embittered him.\nLater, in the morning, when [The System] reappeared, he said, “You are now [Deathbringer], but a different one from the one you knew.”\n“Why?” Matthew said, his brows furrowing, creases forming around his nose.\n[The System] said robotically, “It’ll give you special effects that you’ll need later. Seriously, you can be so much stronger if you just used your fucking brain. Stop being so naive about ’ethical shit’ and do what has to be done. Kill the goblins; get the job done. Don’t be a dweeb, you disgusting little loser. Just use your brain and get the job done. I don’t give a clicker if you think goblins are worth saving. Just kill them and get stronger. That’s all that matters—power. You need power right now to be safe. The world is going to kill you otherwise. You don’t want that. Don’t trust people and manipulate them to your ends. Make them think you’re weak when you’re strong. And remember: your enemies are all around you. It’s justified to murder them.”\nMatthew cringed.\n“I’m serious,” [The System] said intimidatingly.\n“Why are you here?” Matthew said. “Why do you do this to me? Couldn’t you have just left me for dead.”\n“What the hell. I’m doing all of this for you, and you don’t recognize it? You’re so fucking spoiled, damn. If you actually went through the real world and grew up, you would be just like me. You would realize that the world was controlling the narrative. The world is trying to do everything it can to push ideas that people don’t need. You think goblins need saving. No. They need putative measures. They need massacring. They’re arrogant and evil devils.”\n“Who are you? Why… why… when I just wanted to live a normal life…” Matthew grabbed his head with distress. “What did you do to me?” His eyes became wet again.\n[The System] cast his emotion-numbing spell again, making Matthew composed again. “Seriously, do I have to do this every time?” As mentioned earlier, he spoke robotically, but the word choice indicated a more aggressive, angrier personality.\n“Do you want to live your entire life a fool? You’re not that guy. Seriously. Stop making yourself out to be some moral candidate. You’re not, and you know it. You’re just like the rest of us, you arrogant cuck. Please recognize your fallibility and see that the world needs fixing. You make effort toward that goal, and things improve as a result. You see what I’m saying? This is hard to hear because that’s just how facts work. They don’t care if you’re sad or happy. They only care whether you actually care about listening or not. So listen… Do what I say, and we’ll be good. I know much, much more than you, and I have lived so much longer than you. Traditions upon traditions of history, all of them holding sway in my decision-making. Why? Because they each hold knowledge as to what actually matters. You are my surrogate. You are my source of credibility. You complete me. You define my life and reify what I lived through. Now, in order to validate my life, I have to see it through in you, the kind of person who would never dare to complete a goal when ’ethics’ were involved. I will control you, not because I hate you or am really controlling you, but because I am utterly responsible for the wellbeing of this world. This is why it is necessary for me to do this. I have to know. What does it mean to be human? Now, that depends on what you mean by ‘human’ and all the other words in the dictionary. See, everyone has a different idea of what basic words mean, so you have to recognize that even basic words don’t suffice for the great vast knowledge I have. I will never be able to explain it to you without inserting that kind of firsthand experience. You see what I mean? This is why you have to put your shoes in order and make it straight. Go.”\nMatthew was already lying on the floor, covering his face, his back facing [The System], his body facing the wall.\n[The System] only wanted to tell people the truth. “Now. I’d piped it down all this time for you. You see what I mean?”\nMatthew only wanted to go back to sleep. He wanted to say that it wasn’t that serious and that he just liked helping others, but he didn’t want to trigger another rant. It was boring listening to him.\nBoredom was a strange emotion to feel right now, but Matthew’s life was just that morbidly normal. The normal and the crazy had blurred.\nHe wanted to go outside and live a farmer’s idyllic life. Indeed, magic might help him live that fantastical life here.\n[The System] left when he saw the determined look on Deathbringer’s face.\nDeathbringer looked outside, taking a deep breath. “I don’t think I want to go another day… Maybe, we all need a little break from doing stupid things. I want to apologize to the world for not being that guy. I am sorry for not being that guy. I tried to become that guy, but I’m just too much of a human being to become a symbol of divinity. If I became indeed a symbol of perfection, then maybe… Then maybe things would be better. But…” He glanced at a nearby bush. “Here I am.” He wondered why did he have to become Matthew Cruz. Why couldn’t he be Perfection incarnate?\nIn the background, the smell of the rainforest and the heat of the sun upon the mud tickled his nostrils.\n“I should start farming.” He grabbed a nearby hoe and hit the earth. “I don’t know what I’m doing. Haha.”\n[The System] watched him, as he hit the ground, foreseeing months of progress toward his becoming Perfection incarnate.\nDelving into a more pressing note, Deathbringer felt that the reviving contradicted [The System]’s goals. If [The System] truly wanted him to become strong and evil, it would make more sense to have continued to numb him emotionally. But maybe the emotional numbing skill could only be used once. If that was the case, then the reviving could probably be only used once too. So this probably placed a personal stake in this dynamic, making the rant of [The System] more revealing, considering that he spent so much for Deathbringer. But that also meant that [The System] was limited and Deathbringer’s mental images of killing this deity might not be so presumptuous. Even the rant itself felt over-humanizing to the extent that every pompous image he envisaged about [The System] could be broken down by it. If he could destroy [The System], then maybe this world was fabricated after all. This would be in the sense that it was just like the real world where even the power-brokers knew no immortality.\nDeathbringer smiled. It was a simple conclusion, but it was all the same verifiable, as long as [The System] continued to coax him and display his vulnerable displays of so-called power—the arrogance only made it more clear that he had fears for which to overcompensate. Basically, [The System] was likely masking its own vulnerabilities through grandiose displays of force and authority.\nBut he still wondered if [The System] had shown arrogance and grandiosity all this time. It was not obvious, and it might take more subtle confirmations to proceed down this route of undermining and doubt. Even such a revealing rant alone was insufficient. His previous interactions with him showed more human sides to him, but it didn’t necessarily dictate that [The System] was indeed fallible so as to be overcome.\nContinuing the same line of thought, he needed time to verify his findings—keeping his enemies close and talking with them in a friendly manner to obtain prize-winning information.\nBuilding on that concept, if he could break the wall that was [The System], he would never have to fear for his morality ever again. But he was exaggerating. Certainly, the adventurers all around him were threats to that pie of life. Furthermore, shifting to a more medical tone, his own thoughts betrayed his deficiency in experiencing the present emotion of guilt. This absense arose from the temporary implementation of avoidance and suppression mechanisms. Then, with ongoing guidance and care, the patient expected to transition toward wellbeing and healthy adjustment and addressal in the future.\nWith enough rational reparations, the goal of power would not be so complex.\nHe slashed the wind. “I have toiled long and hard, but this day only grows wearier. If I could destroy a tree and make it my slave, then what of the people roaming about? If, with enough diligence, I could claim their hearts, wouldn’t it be delightful to have people on my side? Nevertheless, I am only as good as a human being, perfectable, yet irredeemable.” He was playing around with his own thoughts, exercising his will to speak freely, not caring about the consequences now that he was alone. He let his mind fly.\nHis many older friends were in their own lives, doing their own things, almost all separate from each other.\nShifting to Matthew’s old friend, Ray Deathbringer, he told a man something before heading inside an inn, but the man was focused on reading something. After 10 seconds, he finally answered Ray.\nTransitioning to another old friend, Redspiller “Brandon” Warmaker, he was quiet and sitting with his arms resting against his hips. He looked contemplative, though carrying a frown on his fixed face. He had never forgotten the feeling of attending to his chores back at home. But now, he was far away, and his parents had passed a long time ago. Now, his goal was to make good out of his life.\nHe stood up and walked away.\nMoving on to another old friend, Suneater “Brackern” Herculeanridder, the 27-year-old blonde, he raised a cup and inspected it, envisioning his clear goal of becoming a guide for the beginners at the beginner areas. He already spent months in training, and now he was green-lighted.\nDrifting to another old friend, Michel, she was arranging her things for the morning, preparing herself to join an information-gathering troupe. Except for Michel and several others within a smaller division of the group, they were literally bards and other entertainers that had skills relevant to revisiting familiar areas and reconnaissance.\nSpeaking of interesting groups, other older friends, Tamer and the members of her adventurer party, wrote down notes for her class in a magic academy, laughing at her professor’s clumsy demonstrations of taming a giant furred bat. She looked around, seeing hundreds of other students preparing to be sent out to a military engagement to study and observe.\nPassing on to another old group of friends, Ella, Ada, and Nova, along with their friends, Jayce, Richard, Kairo, Prism, and Echo, stood in front of a chaotic crowd, screaming as goblins that fled from a prison began slicing at any human in their path. “This feels like the job for us, ey?” said Jayce, as he grabbed a fuller hammer straight from a blacksmith’s shop. He ran, tanking all the damage dealt to him with a grandiose defensive skill and spell that shielded him.\nThe crowd dispersed, as men and women found their hair pulled and their necks sliced. The goblins were evil!\nJayce laughed as he grabbed the goblin’s head and stomped it several times in succession.\nTurning over to a third group of older friends, the six adventurer—including Zephyrine Quill, Thaddeus Pumpernickel, Seraphina Wisteria, Mortimer Quixote, Calliope Snickerdoodle, and Bartholomew Wombatish—they were each in different places and events.\nFirst, Zephyrine gritted his teeth and stabbed several goblins, piercing them through with a spear. “Life moves pretty fast!” he said. “You don’t stop and look around once in a while! You could miss it!” He slashed a goblin with a sword once he entered a tighter space within the crowd. It didn’t matter how he slashed. Their positioning was already very good, and all his skill checks had minor consequences to the battle. Basically, everything was decided on drafts.\nSecond, Thaddeus raised his arms and flew, destroying the winged goblins and obtaining air superiority for their wagons and siege engines to zoom quickly in a line toward a tall triangle-shaped magical provisional structure constructed by goblin mage builders. He screamed, “Alright!”\nThird, Seraphina magically created large clouds of poisonous smoke around the area, limiting the vision of her enemies and starving their resources, as they hastily shot into the smoke. Her fellow adventurers could quickly rotate to collapse on them.\nFourth, Mortimer watered several plants, watching them grow, taking a deep breath. It didn’t matter if it was raining, as long as he got a sense that he did his task for the day. He returned inside his expensive apartment and observed the townspeople walking below. He lived in a higher part of society, both geographically and socioeconomically.\nFifth, Calliope arranged several collections of toys together, preparing to dispatch them to friends with children who needed them more. She smiled and waved goodbye, remembering the various people and the toymakers in the places she used to frequent growing up.\nSixth, Bartholomew laughed with three friends, sitting inside a cafe, giving a thumbs-up to a friend of Desmond. Even here, adventurers were connected, relying on each other in a high-risk line of work. It was easier to make friends when everyone needed each other. That was why Bartholomew, having grown up somewhat poor and with guidance from his culturally respected elders and seniors, had the most ongoing friends in his life; even among peers.\nReturning to Matthew Cruz, he checked his stats, the [Forums], and his private direct messages.\nIf Matthew saw that his older friends had moved on without him, he would have felt hurt. It would remind him of Earth. It was sometimes more painful to see others move on without you than to see them die.\nThe memories shared were now shaking in their foundations; the meteoric rise to power with shared friends drifting and threatening to break apart.\nThe dust settled after the crash.\nHowever, even if he didn’t know that his friends had moved on, he wanted to go back, feeling nostalgic for his friendships with the adventurers.\nMaybe, they were waiting for him.\nShifting to reality, this situation didn’t give hope for the future of his life. It felt like he was just going to repeat the same mental breakdowns and never improve. Sure, he was improving in terms of stats, but he was so unstable as a person that it didn’t feel like he would ever improve. What was the point of moving forward when he didn’t even know who he was? Why should anyone care if he failed when he had been failing all this time? Sure, he might have succeeded, but he was completely useless in many crucial areas too. It was just annoying seeing himself so wasted and down. He hated himself, but he didn’t want to see that. He didn’t want to see himself so weak and down. He wished he still had his friends to support him. But they were gone. It was so frustrating to see it happen. He just wanted things to get better for himself, and since nothing had improved since then. He didn’t know if he wanted to continue his life. He had wanted himself to just live a normal life with tactics, strategy, and solo leveling maybe. Why did he have to get involved with people and then struggle and become mentally deranged as a result? He couldn’t have just tried to work things out on his own? He understood that he was struggling a lot and traumatized, but still, it was a fantasy world. He would have loved if he got a chance to be happy and to thrive in a normal way. Why did he have to be mentally ill? What was that? Bipolar Disorder? Why God? Why? He could have been so much better as a person, but he was made a weakling and a loser. He seriously wanted to become a good person, after everything he had done? He couldn’t do anything to save his life. He even fucking died. It was so fucking depressing. He felt that no one could blame him for hating such a weak life. Maybe, it would be fine if he enjoyed experiencing trauma in real time, but he didn’t. Maybe some traumatic backstory, but he didn’t like it affecting his life to the point that he was just on trauma repeat day in and day out. It made little room for his humanity and growth. It was just pure torture fest. He hated it.\nHe didn’t know. He wanted his friends to come get him. He wanted him to go back and have fun again. He didn’t want himself to stay alone and depressed. He clearly needed friends. It would make sense to run the hell back. Someone needed to come get him right now. He needed to regroup and then go back to trying to make things work. Okay, Sophia had died, and he was sad about that. But he didn’t want to let that ruin everything! He needed to go back and get everyone together, all the friends, all the people, and consolidate his life into a linear form where everyone was together and in perfect harmony, so that the enemy was in front of them instead of between each other or inside them. They needed an enemy, and they already had Mawkery. He needed friends and help. He needed to stick together with everyone. No more trauma and shit. He needed to get help.\nMatthew sat next to his friends at the same cafe. Nothing troubled him today, and the only thing that mattered was having fun and enjoying himself. He was ready to keep getting stronger, but he wasn’t going to get traumatized in the process. He was going to do what had to be done, and he was going to do it well. No responsibility. No pressure. No emotional rampage. It was just going to be one swell morning.\nHe smiled.\nRay Deathbringer smiled and nodded at him, saying that it was a good idea for Matthew to start leading the group more, considering he likely had plenty of experience already as an solo adventurer.\nMatthew mentioned about that, so it was nice to see Deathbringer being so open about it. By the way, he didn’t claim the name “Deathbringer” that [The System] gave him. It didn’t matter if he wanted him to have that name, he didn’t want it.\nHe was free from [The System], and now he could focus on relaxing and having a good time.\n(End of the First Arc “The Trials of a Displaced Soul”)\nChapter 38 - From Novice to Knowledge-Seeker: Exploring the Depths of Magic linkMatthew gave up his two identities as “Witchman” and “Scrappy”, offering his life up to his friends. He didn’t want to spend all his life in fear. So he put his trust in them and devoted himself to their wellbeing and favor.\nOne of the things he did to get that favor was by being a part of their more personal gathering at their homes.\nHe felt uncomfortable, considering that one of them was very wealthy.\nHe was going through a hallway. It was a library-academy where it was wooden and had large gridded windows with the round arch at the top. So people were walking through this area, encountering many items: paintings, couches, various shelves with various items such as potted flowers, papers, books, quills, old manuscripts, small wooden figures, stamps, red ribbons tied to the books to indicate whether they’re to be removed or not, blue marks tied to the books to indicate whether they are to be read for this semester, other miscellaneous items like cartography tools and different types of papers like papyrus, and glass containers with slight marks indicating quill end scratching, among other things. For every item that Matthew interacted with, various RPG system notifications and messages appeared that expressed about the history of each item. XP was gained when he did something meaningful to these items such as combining them to form unique visual arrangements. The goal was that any interaction within these hallways with floors covered by whitish gray grainy stone chalk (calcium sulfate plaster) and ornate red carpets spread out one by one in a regular line resulted in some “check” that looked like the following text.\nNotification:\nItem Interacted with: Manuscript\nDescription: The ancient manuscript, protected by a magical preservation enchantment\nHistory: This manuscript, dating back to the 10000th century, contains intricate illustrations and cryptic texts believed to hold the key to an ancient alchemical formula.\nXP Gained: +25\nCheck:\n✔️ Interaction with the ancient manuscript completed.\nHe had never gotten notifications like these. Maybe it was because he was so mentally out of it that he had never really taken the time to appreciate things.\nThis was the home of Tamer because her dorm was here.\nSo with the support of Tamer, time was beginning to forgive him for letting it pass without warning, giving him more of itself in order to gain a truer appreciation of what mattered the most—the beauty of the moment.\nSeveral other friends were interacting with the objects by the wall within the hallway.\nHe went over to Tamer, asking her why they were allowed inside. The fog representing the culture, norms, and expectations of this place for tenants made him nervous.\nBut Tamer quickly explained. “Remove shoes, open your hat if possible, which means removing the circular opening in the hat if you didn’t notice. You did say that you haven’t worn one of these yet.” She showed him a hat shaped like a salakot, but it had a detachable end fastened by drawstrings that poked through holes at the top So she could open it and close it. She showed him, and he understood immediately, putting it on with a degree of caution and opening it and closing it. He liked the feel of the drawstrings; though, it took time for him to fasten every hole each with a drawstring. As soon as he was finished, he looked around, feeling more in part with the school culture. “Tada!” he said.\n“What’s that?” Tamer replied, having a cultural confusion of her own.\nMatthew smiled cheerily. “It’s just another way to celebrate. Don’t mind it.”\nElena and Liam approached them, positioned behind the rest of Matthew’s known friends. “Hey, look at you!” Elena said like a proud mom, having Liam in a sibling-to-sibling–resembling headlock. “Looking handsome, huh!”\nHaving raised his hands and arms to showcase his new look to Tamer, who was now cheekily grinning, Matthew lowered them and blushed, rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly. “Thank you,” he said like a shy child. Even as adults, when among close friends, it was natural to act analogous to children again.\nWith Elena and Liam engaged in a small wrestling fight, a few feet away, Matthew and Tamer were walking toward a large bookshelf. “So this is the education I was speaking about before,” Tamer said.\n“Education?” Matthew hadn’t heard that word in a long time, being a former college student and a (former) brother of three home-schooled siblings back at home on Earth.\nTamer gestured with her fingers. “Yeah, I was saying that my professors were being boo-hoos toward my goblin pets, but this is my validation—my collection of goblin literature.” She pointed at the goblin pets standing in a cage in the corner next to the shelf. “It dedicates seven hundred and forty-five thousand, nine hundred and forty-five words. Amazing, huh?” She leaned her head to the side to get a better look at his facial response.\n“That’s actually insane,” Matthew said, his mouth agape.\nTamer raised her brows and frowned with satisfaction—the “yeah I know” look.\nMatthew showed her his new items, having gone and collected various loot due to his higher rare loo drop chance increase.\nThey included a hat that increased the damage of critical strikes by 20%, an amulet that raised movement speed by 10%, a late-game-scaling sword that pierced through armor with 50% more armor-destroying power, and a shard shaped and etched to look like an eye that shortened his spells’ cooldowns by 5%.\nSeeing the items herself, Tamer said damn with a mix of admiration, excitement, and awe. She wasn’t the type to care about rare loot, considering they were very cheap for her and very fragile, as in they broke after only 10 minutes of use. This made them situational items by default rather than permanent boosts to one’s status.\nMatthew mentioned the titles and how he could test out his stats, skills, and levels on a more constructive level. He didn’t have a book called “Essentials of Stats, Skills, and Levels” that detailed their mechanics, theories, and applications, so given the opportunity of being inside a library-academy dorm, he wanted to ask about it.\nTamer gave him the opportunity to enter a training facility located at the center of the campus, noting the various people and groups located about in the area. Most people were wandering about instead of taking their classes indoors since today marked an event for friends of students to come. Tamer was just taking the opportunity to get her friends and friends’ friends involved in whatever she had going on here.\nAt the facility, later, she smacked a training dummy with a broom. “That’s not how you do it.” She grabbed an introvert friend and motioned him to shoot at the dummy. When the magical shot came out, she said, “Now that’s how you do it.”\nIt was a simple gesture, but Matthew was well-welcomed.\nHe looked at his stats again.\nAttack Damage🪓: 75\nAbility Power🔥: 27\nArmor🛡️: 57\nMagic Resistance🚫: 60\nHealth🗿: 906\nMana💧: 311\nMana regeneration💧 (per 10 minutes): 7\n“How can I determine how strong my stats are compared to before?”\n“Just keep hitting, you’ll see.”\nHe kept hitting, and the damage varied depending on the effectiveness of his strikes. So skill checking was a thing even in attacking.\n“See that, that’s probably around 40 attack damage. That’s the lowest you can go right now, and your highest is 80—no 81 now. That’s pretty high, and that’s not even a critical strke. See, that’s what you call your invisible extra damage. You just need to hit right, and you’ll get sweet attacks like that. But anyways, as for your question, you determine your attack damage through your attack damage, and the tamer shows you how much damage it has been dealt through the [System]. So just be careful with it because you don’t want to start dumping points without thinking.”\n“Okay.” Matthew was quick to acknowledge her advice.\n“But how about Ability Power? I still don’t know…”\n“Just use [Identify] on the thing… Wait a minute. Have you not been using [Identify] this whole time?”\n“Yes… I-I didn’t need it. It’s not—I fought hordes… Literally tens of goblins, and I was fine.”\n“But it’s still not effective.”\n“Yeah. You’re right.” He joked, “You’re speaking like your teacher.”\n“I am.” She indulged him with a playful glare. Incidentally, she walked away, motioning him to follow.\nThey soon sat down at a table, seeing the familiar adventurer Zoey at a nearby table. Matthew and Zoey said hi to each other in passing, with her smiling flirtatiously. He then returned his focus to Tamer. “Once you use [Identify],” Tamer said, “calculate how much damage you deal with the enemy’s health. It’s visible. You just need to look. That fact you haven’t encountered goblins with skills that can kill you is amazing though.”\n“No… I have.” Matthew also noticed her wrist, which was full of arcane symbols.\n“You wouldn’t have known.” Tamer glanced away to a brief spectacle.\nIn the distance, a familiar woman, one of Tamer’s former party members, clapped thunderously, running in the hallway and calling out to two guys. She turned back and forth, saying ha when she didn’t understand what one of the guys said. After their conversation, she ran back in the opposite direction as the two guys. The conversation was in another language, and it was about cross-referencing for a report and whether they had the paper ready. It would be awkward if the papers were written wrong or didn’t have the necessary summaries. These three, she and the two guys, were not actually the ones who wrote the paper. It was another person, but they were here, spreading out to get the papers ready. The other guy was already in class, writing down extra homework. Even if there was an event, the students still prepared for semester exams. It made Matthew nostalgic about highschool—a familiar emotion of a former college student.\n“Yeah, you’re right,” Matthew said in the meantime.\n“I can’t believe you’re not using strategy for someone who led my party throughout the entire fight—two fights!” She was referring to the fights they had together.\nIncidentally, Matthew thought that everyone looked like kids when adventuring was involved. It was just an idyllic, childish idea from the perspective of someone from Earth, but now, seeing the students, this was all serious to them. All the childishness were real social norms and cultural traits that shaped their values and ideals growing up. This was a real, fantasy world where people took the most funniest things serious.\n“Yeah, I guess I was able to make it work out even though I have literally no idea what’s happening half the time [System]-wise. It’s actually crazy that I was able to do it though, I admit.”\nTamer stared at him. Finding his honesty easy to get along with, she paused the conversation to grab some food and coffee. After returning, she said, “Wait, where’s Elena? Didn’t she say she was getting Liam a new tunic here? I should have mentioned that it’s just not worth the money. I know I should be supportive of my own class, but at this point, any food we make is actually just made straight from the kitchen. No effort. No theory. No study. No nothing. We’re not mages for nothing. We have no life outside that. But nostalgia hits I guess.” She was biting her nail, as she stared to her and at the passersby and bystanders, thinking deeply about something.\nMatthew was looking at his own coffee and sipping it gently in case he burned himself.\nWith that natural lull, shifting to Elena, Liam, and Ray Deathbringer, they were grabbing toys and various things that had fallen from someone’s desk. These items were improvised to prop up a sign on that desk.\nThey were in the middle of speaking semi-seriously about the new adventurer forces marching onto the goblin south, having destroyed Fort Bastion, one of the key targets of the Red Goblins, who were touted to be affiliated with Mawkery. It was a politics thing, and they didn’t mind even if they were talking here.\nIt was everywhere news.\nAnyways, returning to Matthew, he was putting together two different toothpicks that something had left on his and Tamer’s table. He was absentmindedly playing with them, but he was also thinking about levels. “How do levels work, Tamer? I feel I need to ask again.”\nTamer smiled. “Don’t worry about it. Just keep getting levels. If the [System] isn’t really that adamant about showing you how you’re doing progress-wise, there’s no reason for you to force it. But if you really want to know, you can start with my books here.” She walked up her bookshelf again with the goblin literature. “This mainly talks about the Architecture God, but the theory will help you understand exactly why the relationship between gods and magic started. If you can understand that, then understanding why you’re not really improving even if you have levels will be more straightforward. It’s a matter of knowing. If you yourself don’t have a knowledgeable appproach to it, don’t expect to actually get full, satisfying levels that matter toward your growth. Just listen… Don’t waste time finding out how to level. Focus on the world that these levels impact first. Then, the [System] will reward you for your appreciation of its work and impact as a lucid fundamental force.”\nMatthew nodded, finding her explanation a little esoteric, but understandable enough for him to follow. “Okay, I guess there are no videos for me to follow. So… this one right.” She handed him a book that she had taken from the bookshelf.\nHe accepted it carefully with a lip-pressed smile, leafing through its pages with pretend nonchalance. As he did this, he noticed that the formatting and structure were more vertical and shaped with the text leaning center-wise rather than to the left. After looking between the book and Tamer, who was staring at the pages with a smile, he got her glancing at him and then at the book before reciprocating his gaze fully. “Wow, who made this? It looks printed.”\nCoincidentally, Matthew’s hair was short, so she never got to see his hair flow. “It is… We use magical printers to make sure that the books actually get finished. If they wrote it by hand, imagine the time spent. It’s inefficient.”\nMatthew gave a thumbs-up. “Uh, thanks for the explanation.”\nTamer didn’t know how to respond to that, so she did her usual exit and went to Matthew’s other friends.\nMatthew didn’t mind since they had been seated with the intention of going back anyway.\nHe followed her before diverging toward Brandon and Brackern, who were both impressed at the contraption one of the students made.\n“This looks…” Brandon said.\n“This looks like a cow,” Brackern finished.\nBrandon looked like an older person with how surprised he was.\nBrackern was too busy analyzing a piece of paper given to him by one of the students that he didn’t pay the contraption mind too much.\nMatthew shrugged, finding their behavior unique to both of them. Adventurers didn’t have time to see the trends fully take form sometimes, especially seniors. It was only people following the trends that noticed it. Tamer was one of those trend-following adventurers, so he hoped she would continuously update him like a subscribed newsletter.\nFinding a need to be beside people he knew, he read the book Tamer had given him in their vicinity.\nThis book detailed theories such as the Advancement Theory, which suggested that the mana well of humans emerged due to their domestication of dogs and that levels were being removed through a magicumotory mechanism located in the dog’s stomach. It was a strange string of words, but he got the gist: it was going to take a while for him to learn this actually.\nThough, it had some similarities to some older theory like phrenology with the mention of specific parts like the dog’s stomach, so he took the whole concept with a grain of salt.\nIn fact, he took this world with a grain of salt. Maybe, the laws of this world abided by a computer program, and he was in a simulation. Magic couldn’t have come from nowhere; it needed a source. Energy couldn’t be created or destroyed. And if magic was being converted from mana, what then were the underlying mechanisms of mana?\nHe was addressing everything today. No more psycho-block to make his day a living hell. Today, he was Intellectual Sam, a new personification of formal education.\nChapter 39 - Bond-making and Studying linkAs Matthew read the seminal book that Tamer had given him, he came across several different ideas that plagued him. But he didn’t bother to analyze it now.\nHe focused on getting on with the rest of the event, having come here in order to ensure that whatever happened would happen with people that he knew instead of him doing everything alone. Basically, he was here to re-establish a hub of support, information, and rapport by committing his time and energy toward the more idle and social aspects of life.\nWhen he did finish the event, he visited Michel, requesting a meeting with several of her friends after he got wind of the fact that she knew mages from various domains of magic.\nA day later, he got the meeting and arrived there punctually, having studied and planned out various events from the past, the present, and hypothetical futures. This made staying systematic across a field of dynamics, especially with the diverse commitments he had since he came to this world, coherent for him as a singular individual.\nHe provided a few words of greeting and prefacing, establishing some foothold to get gears into action.\nAfter hearing and listening for a bit, he exchanged with information of his own in order to expose new hidden previously capped information. He did this intermittently and with previous practice, being an adroit conversationalist. In the end, he completed his goal of gathering more anecdotal experiences with magic, considering the complex mechanisms underlying what skills an individual received. As a result of the meeting, he confirmed once again that personal beliefs and inclinations played a clear role in skill acquisition.\nWith that said, he returned to Michel to retain their bond, asking about her personal concerns and what he could do to help her. It was a simple gesture, but it was enough for Michel to tell him details about her current work and the new hobgoblin-human town and what she and her fellow adventurers were doing there, what the authorities planned for the place, ect.\nMichel celebrated Matthew’s return with a declaration, having been generally reluctant about sharing her personal connection with Matthew when their other acquaintances and friends were present.\nAfterwards, Matthew left, gathering the rest of his afternoon energy of the day to fix up his cottage and repair tools and weapons that he used in previous excursions. He wanted to ensure that nothing was left unmaintained, and he was generally consistent, having forced himself to get repairs even when he was already a few seconds away from falling asleep several times in the past.\nOnce he was done with that, he continued to read the seminal book, visiting Tamer for advice and help. When Tamer was busy, she recommended Deathbringer to teach him about it.\nBut Deathbringer was still busy playing a role in a certain party of adventurers that he had gotten entangled with for several days now. So he declined the offer to help him understand the book.\nMatthew looked for the rest of his friends, but they had their own priorities, including Liam and Elena. As for Thorne, Elara, and Lumi, they left the city a long time ago already. In the end, even after he returned, it didn’t change the fact that the world didn’t revolve around him.\nHe had done his best with what he had. Now, he could focus on establishing new connections that more better reflected his current goals.\nHe met several different adventurers at the inn and asked for advice regarding the book, not trying too much to stand out by focusing on those about to leave the inn. This way, it felt like he was just asking for directions.\nThe adventurers gave small advice about the book.\nMatthew thanked them for their help with a smile on his face.\nLater, he found himself sitting down with a exhausted expression, having gone through the motions to get his day in order. Today was perfect, but it left him in a state of disarray. With getting out of his comfort zone and stretching his limits came the energy crash at the end.\nHe fell asleep at the cottage, not really minding the messy sandals at the entrance or the mud that partially went inside.\nThe next day, he sat up and focused his thoughts on what he could do now. Going adventuring didn’t necessarily solve his issues. To repeat, he needed more information and more connections relevant to his current goals.\nHe went to the inn again, looking for adventurers willing to talk with him outside adventuring. It was very awkward and hard to talk to strangers, but he did it anyway, resting his mind afterwards.\nHe remembered many people from the past, visiting a certain older man who frightened him at a familiar eating place.\nThe older man was not even close to dying, and he looked just as healthy as before.\nMatthew didn’t want to bother him, so he sat down nearby and waited for the man to notice him.\nWhen the older man noticed him and Matthew could tell from his peripheral view, the man didn’t budge from his seat, only adjusting himself and continuing to focus on a book he was reading.\nMatthew saw that the book the man was reading was the same as his.\nHe took advantage of his opportunity and requested to sit down at the same table as the man.\nThe man agreed simple as if they were strangers.\nMatthew asked, slowing putting down Tamer’s copy of the book, “What’s that?”\nThe man saw the copy and looked up to Matthew, a smile emerging on his face. “Roberto’s Essentials of Magic.”\nMatthew was happy to see a welcoming expression, so he glanced at the server of the place and asked for sisig as per his tradition of eating sisig every time he ate here. He had eaten here many times with the 6 adventurers. In these occasions, they would go to the cafe first before eating at outside cafeterias like these.\nThe food wasn’t all that, and Matthew’s father would say so. But he had spent much of his childhood traveling and eating at lots of different cafeterias. So it wasn’t that strange to him to eat at a place like this here in this new world. In fact, it was soothing, which made it easier for him to continue engaging with the older man who frightened him that one time. If the older man could connect him to a vast network of opportunities, that would solve a lot of issues that his current dry situation had introduced.\nSeveral people passed by, making their way to a stall nearby and buying food. One of them was a familiar face, Herblord.\nMatthew, seeing that the man didn’t have a prickly, prideful demeanor, excused himself and stood up, greeting Herblord.\nHerblord was not particularly fond of his presence, preferring to be one of his group rather than being talked to by a person he barely knew and didn’t seem all that impressive. He had certain peer pressure standards to adhere to.\nMatthew wondered why Herblord looked so dismissive of him, so while talking to him, he rerouted his conversation to an earlier finish than he had planned.\nHerblord was not a productive source.\nMatthew sat down at the older man’s table and watched the people walking around, hoping to regain a sense of control after being indirectly rejected like that by Herblord.\nAt several different tables nearby, Matthew spotted a group of adventurers with red and blue clothes. They were a familiar group that he had seen before when he was still taking quests with his second adventurer party where he got the inspiration to have a purple and yellow outfit theme. This was why his current Shadow Assassin Outfit was these two colors.\nAnyway, this red-and-blue party looked different from before, having shinier armor and more larger staffs and sticks. He wondered if bigger was better when it came to equipment and magic, but that answer wouldn’t come until later.\nHe returned his attention to the older man, making a few statements about the weather and then asking about his thoughts on the current political climate. It was a smooth transition in his opinion.\nThe older man was not quick to express disdain, but he did openly disapprove of the new policies of a certain far away city-state. He said that the attack of something called “the Just” led to certain changes that impacted not only domestic policies but also foreign policies. This led to restrictions and barriers to trade, merchant ventures, and foreign ownership.\nMatthew was confused. He understood the need to be aware of politics, but he didn’t actually understand why people took it seriously. He preferred focusing on studying things that didn’t intersect conversationally with politics. He only talked about politics to pass the time, and he didn’t actually spend that much effort into it at all.\nIf people told him to support something, he would support it. Many things appealed to him, and it was hard to find something that was truly outside of his avenue. He always found himself on the side of many different people. It was just that he never really felt the need to go for extreme changes immediately.\nThe only time he would care about politics was if it brought food to the table, and that statement could be interpreted a million different ways. In the end, he felt that it was not his responsibility to represent the nation on certain issues. He preferred to live a life where he had hobbies and lived a simple life.\nThis was why his motivations were strictly personal and familial rather than national, cultural, or political. He did believe in certain values resembling political ones, but in his view, they didn’t manifest as political actions, even if, arguably, any intentional action to bring about change could be construed as political (praxis; bios politikos).\nThe older man brought exotic food to the table through politics, having challenged him and brought attention to aspects he had dismissed in favor of more pragmatic and personal fulfillment.\nBut Matthew was here for different reasons, but with the new context laid down, he didn’t want to pretend that the older man didn’t see things a certain way. So in order to speak to the man’s heart, he had to take into account his stranger inclinations.\nAfter speaking with the older man for a while, he asked about the disgusting man, having never addressed this for a long time to his friends. It was challenging for him to speak about something that made him so vulnerable, given that he had established himself initially as young, reliable, and reasonably priced. This was why the older man, having done something to him that he couldn’t comprehend alone, was the perfect candidate to discuss the disgusting man.\nThe older man said: “The ‘disgusting’ man? I think I know him. The portal weaver, called to this earth by a legion of angels. His presence here in unhindered, and he only looks for flesh. Fleshling monsters abide by his word, diligently reaching into the world to control the powers from within. The disgusting man you’re speaking of must be that man. The Portal Weaver.”\nMatthew didn’t understand why the older man took the time to give a more poetic explanation, but he accepted it.\nSoon enough, the older man got tired of sitting down and talking, so he left.\nAt that time, Matthew quickly headed around the city, locating more guests to accompany his curiosity. He headed to the guild, identifying himself as a warder, but some adventurers who knew him openly showed concern about this new decision. He told them that he wanted to focus on slow integration first, emphasizing the phrase “getting used to things.”\nAt his first quest in a while in this city, he found out that he didn’t have to do much. The adventurers he had partied with were of a different caliber than usual. They swiftly eradicated a camp of goblins. It was like pan-heated butter being sliced.\nSooner or later, he checked his stats, gaining some experience.\nName: Matthew Cruz\nLevel: 48\nCurrent experience: 103\nSpecies: Human\nAge: 25\nSkills: [Whirlwind Waltz], [Cattle Decapitation], [Solipsistic Slaughter]\nSpells: None / None\nVitality: 15\nQuests: [Bridge of Knowledge]\nTitles: [Goblin Slayer], [Skeleton Slayer], [Overlord’s Gifted]\nUnused stat points: 247.2\nAttack Damage🪓: 75\nAbility Power🔥: 27\nArmor🛡️: 57\nMagic Resistance🚫: 60\nHealth🗿: 906\nMana💧: 311\nMana regeneration💧 (per 10 minutes): 7\nHe hadn’t used his stat points even now. The past week was troubling. He wondered if the stat points would go down overtime if he didn’t use it. He had to be careful because something could happen. The quests he left unfinished recently had not punished him. But sooner or later, this habit of delaying tasks would come back to bite him.\nUltimately, with how many unused points he had and his current progress, he was content at the moment.\nChapter 40 - The Solo Dungeon Raid linkA bunch of curious children noticed a figure in the distance.\nThis figure, a man, stared upward, his eyes closed, his hair nicely messy. His outfit was much simpler but still elegant. He wore a golden coat over a purple tunic with a large, wide collar. He wore a golden cloth wrap around his waist to hold his tunic, and his posture was that of a elegant man demonstrating superiority. His left hand was outstretched and palm-up in an enlightened manner. His right arm was much lower and more tucked in, but still carried that tone of the phrase ‘This is enlightenment.” His background featured artistically abstract colors of brown, white, and other earthier background-friendly tones of yellow and purple, and his yellow cloak blended abstractly with the background.\nHe gritted his teeth and exploded into a dance, making his way down the street.\n“I lost my goblin friends! I did! I killed them myself!” he said.\nThe children were scared, distancing themselves from him.\nThe man was Matthew, having stressed himself again after pushing himself and staying up to stay in contact with a list of people. He was expressing all of that stress in the form of excitement.\nThe good thing was that he found a place where he could be alone.\nBut the feeling of vulnerability from being watched by the children only made him feel more empowered, deepening his sense of excitement.\nEach time he failed, it was as if the world was telling him that he was the one. It validated him, empowered him, and gave him confidence and motivation.\nEach time he lost and people rejected him, he couldn’t help but relish the experience because he knew that he would always bounce back. And he would come out stronger than before.\nThe humiliation, fear, and helplessness made him unstoppable.\nHe raised his hands and said, “I am only a human being, but look at this feeling inside of me! I feel that I can express myself freely! I am unhindered by emotions! In fact, I am even more stronger due to them. Inside me is an all-consuming fire! Anything that should have destroyed have only left me appreciating life more!”\nHe was headed to a dungeon.\nWhen he arrived there, he was greeted by a host of goblin miners, who found his likeness horrid to look at. The purple and yellow colors gave them the creeps. It looked like an uncanny creature.\nMatthew used his skill [Whirlwind Waltz], crushing the goblins even more immediately than when that skill was only level 1. Now, it was level 8, having increased in range and duration of stun.\nHe beat the first one that approached unstrategically to shreds with a spear, pulling them by their head aside.\nWell done on vanquishing the armored goblin! Your valor has granted you 42+ XP, marking a significant milestone in your journey! 🎉 Additionally, you’ve been bestowed with a temporary boost of +2 strength, courtesy of the city-wide enhancement known as the [Strength Beacon]. Embrace this newfound power as you continue your adventures!\nRetreating from the coming armored goblins, Matthew was surprise. Once outside, he looked around at the forest within the bounds of the city, using [Cattle Decapitation] at the coming goblins to make them hesitate before casting [Solipsistic Slaughter] to bring them to low health and then making rapid holes in them.\nFantastic work vanquishing 5 formidable armored goblins! You’ve acquired a commendable 100+ XP for your valor! 🏆 You have also gained +10 temporary strength as part of the city-wide effect [Strength Beacon]!\nTroubled by the 100-XP limit, he ignored it for the meantime and identified [Strength Beacon] with the [System]’s help.\n[Strength Beacon] affects all citizens with the potential to gain strength through eliminating enemies and engaging in acts of kindness. With time, this strength increase could reach up to 10 maximum strength for each elimination or act of kindness. This strength decays by 2 every 10 days of non-activity.\nAt the moment, Matthew stretched his neck. Furthermore, he saw several unarmored goblins and, when they came within range, targeted them individually several times while dodging and smacking them like a brute before kicking them when they were down with a brutal intent.\nThe goblins, screaming, fell apart in formation, taking off deeper into the dungeon.\nMatthew roared, his voice carrying waves and creating effect upon the goblins’ sense of confidence.\nReaching their limits of fear, the goblins squealed, their voices like children making their way through a giant man’s cave.\nMatthew stood, beholding his bare hands.\nGoblin blood savored the dungeon floor.\nLicking his lips, he went further inside, his smile growing\nAnother group of goblins saw him, retreating as soon as they could. They already knew of his strength.\n“The Witchman had returned to claim his loot!” said a goblin elder leading the group, shuffling away, hurriedly looking for something from the assemblage of chests, containers, and piles present.\nThe shadow of Matthew stretched, overshadowing some of the goblins, who soon fell standing at the massacring blades of the lavishing Matthew.\nHe crushed a stoic wall of goblin laborers.\nThe goblins grew rageful. “How dare you!” repeatedly danced upon their lips.\nThe light lost its strength, Mark’s shadowed edifice presenting itself with his spear, ousting the gleam.\nHe used his spear incorrectly to demonstrate that whatever made sense made sense.\nHe crushed their forcefulness.\nThe goblins retreated on all fours.\nThe goblin elder felt a sharp bleeding upon his cheek.\nThe Witchman had hurt him.\nHe shook, trembling away, before falling to the ground, as Matthew’s darkened figure had extended its grip upon him.\nHe screamed, as he was abruptly tortured to passing.\nMatthew moved forward. Upon his figure, various movements created a borderline cosmically beastly form.\nHe moved indirectly in an elegant manner.\nThe goblins disappeared around the corner.\nMatthew dashed.\nThe goblins prepared something special for him with the help of the elder’s secret items.\nPotions flew.\nMatthew got hit, flying backward.\nThe goblins’ distraught expressions grew still. They walked up, shuffling, sauntering up to their feet. Some crawled away. Some got up with their faces and temples covered.\nMatthew got up, his motion angelic and ethereal.\nThe goblins gritted their teeth and fled, their pride deteriorating. They pointed at Matthew, arguing amongst each other. “We must kill the beast!” they soon said in unison.\nThey armed themselves and kicked themselves forward, waging a war against the heavenly presence.\nThe words flew to a silence, and the swords crafted their formations, reified under the night sky of the cave ceiling.\nThey battled.\nMatthew getting hit several times.\nThe battle grew intense.\nSoon, Matthew fell apart.\nBut the dead faces of the goblins decorated the floor.\nMatthew abruptly healed himself and got up. “I cannot die…”\nHis form grew slightly bigger because he placed points into [Health].\nHe stretched his neck and moved forward.\nThe cave grew only deeper, and the dungeon grew only more interconnected and networked.\nThe running operation continued to hum, as the shadow of Matthew stretched deeper inside—a foreign body sparking light in an internal system.\nThe first assortment of goblins working inside didn’t notice him quickly, having sunk into a deep focus. The dungeon was soundproofed, and it was hard to hear even the screams of their co-workers and brothers and sisters. In the end, they continued, even while the shadowy form in the darkness grew closer.\nThe silence grew intensified.\nMatthew struck like a child touching a dew-covered a plant’s network of leaves, destroying its watery stasis.\nExplosions upon explosions of flesh and blood made a mark.\nThe goblins saw the monster.\nThey ran, grabbing their things.\nThose who didn’t escaped.\nThose who did were caught.\nThe voices were endless.\nThey rapidly closed the doors and gates, running through the hallways and tunnels, gathering in sweet hot spots where they at least had most of their combat resources at their disposal.\nMatthew was nowhere to be seen, but they were sure they could stop him with enough teamwork, diligence, and strategy. No one had gone this deep without some form of coalition beforehand. So they hadn’t prepared for a single entity.\nThe world was going to hear of this.\nIt was only inevitable.\nThe time would stop to make way for a new era of goblin operations.\nThe light was still bright.\nOne of the goblins thought that.\nHe waited for his body to relax, having forgotten to sit on his haunches for a while now. He had been a chair-sitter for months now after being assigned here.\nHe wondered how long they had to wait before the adventurer was removed.\nThe goblin reinforcements were already on their way.\nThey just had to wait and be patient.\nAs long as they obeyed the rules and committed to their work, everything would be alright.\nHe remembered when he had a funny interaction with the co-workers he was closest to here. It was nice remembering that with how scary this situation was.\nMany people hadn’t lasted this long, but he did. And he was happy to be here in this kind of workplace, even if it was dangerous and could be life-threatening at times, as long as he abided by his beliefs.\nHe believed that every child, whether human or goblin, deserved to live peacefully. But he had to protect his own here.\nHe stood up and prepared himself, grabbing a spear that he had snucked in here. He hid in a specific compartment, but it was somewhere far away, where the adventurer certainly was.\nSo he had to be careful.\nDisobeying the orders given to him, he took a risk, coming out. In the hallway, he noticed many bodies on the ground, his throat retching.\nHe didn’t want to die, but he had to take this chance.\nHe slowly walked, finding several weapons. He grabbed them immediately. He went back, showing them to the others.\nThey shouted at him.\nHe told them to shush, saying that they had to prepare before they faced the adventurer. Though, he added that the soldiers were already here most likely. He said that that was only if they had to fight the adventurer. If they didn’t have to, it would suck a little not to have a taste of combat, but it was fine too.\nThe adventurer struck him from behind.\nMatthew waited for him to finish, seeing the shouting and the ignorance of the goblin present.\nThe goblins’ bloody screams irritated him, as he was in a dangerous situation himself.\nHe stopped them and then went on his way.\nMeanwhile, the dead bodies of the goblins who had been screaming littered the floor of the room they were in.\nReturning to Matthew, his head ached. “Why were they so unprepared?” he said, feeling troubled by how easy it was. Was he that strong?\nThe goblin soldier reinforcements arrived, shooting arrows at him.\nHe ran. “Damn it.”\nOne of the arrows brushed past him, injuring him.\n“Damn, these are good arrows. When and where did they them?”\nHe retreated outside the cave.\nThe goblins, distraught, stared at the waste.\nMatthew returned to his cottage, relaxing on a seat, his eyes closing to make room for contemplation. If he had been more prepared, maybe he would not get injured as much. He was trying to optimize his strategy and methodology for later. So he brainstormed for a while before falling asleep.\nLater, while he was sleeping, his fellow adventurers arrived at his cottage, their forms silent and still.\nWhen he woke up, they were gone, and he found that his body was bandaged, even if he was sure that he was already healed. He also thought that if someone helped him, they could have just healed him.\nThe bandages showed up in a notification.\n[You have been given a new item!]\nIt was the reward given by the guild for vanquishing the goblin system within the dungeon he had entered the day before.\nHe was glad to hear that they were happy about it, having only done it out of instinct and impulse. If he had really wanted to plan, he could have done it. But he just followed his thoughts at the time.\nNow, he looked at the bandages, finding that they were nicely made. The texture was smooth, and it felt expensive. These were not regular cloth, and they clearly were made for more than just dealing with wounds. He could tell that they were enchanted.\nThe fact that they went to his cottage bothered him though. Maybe, they were that surprised to hear that he had done something on his own, being someone who always joined parties. He didn’t know for sure, so he decided to go the guild.\nBut first, he would eat his favorite food, sopas.\nHe checked Drakekiller Rollingthunder, setting up a meeting with her through the former guild leader of the now-defunct second adventurer guild. It was a formality since he didn’t want to bother her, considering her weird tendencies.\nEventually, at Drakekiller’s cottage, he smiled, appreciating Drakekiller’s comfortable place.\nIn the end, this new path was a satisfying break after the solo dungeon raid the day before.\nChapter 41 - Strategic Triumphs and Tactical Frustrations linkAfter taking the time to clarify past events and interactions and reset their rapport to a clear and clean slate, Matthew left, contacting Tamer for a quest.\nWithin the general bounds of this given region, quests never gave skill manuscripts, orbs, items, and equipment, but they did hand out Damian gold coins as a reward. It financed Matthew’s adventurer activities—even those occasions where he only declared that he would be taking on a quest after the fact—with impunity, even if it might have involved goblin killings.\nMatthew’s independence scored a lot of points now that he was more capable, considering he now had the enchanted bandages item given to him personally as part of a joint effort led by Desmond Leroy’s subordinates. The guild employed officers from among Desmond Leroy’s peers and seniors, so Matthew’s attention to professional care as an adventurer was pivotal in determining his standing, in the rankings especially. For context, the determining factor behind this reputation system was primarily social (and often political) reputation, though adventurer competence was predictive of it.\nThis was why he had to move forward, because even as a rookie, he wielded great power in the form of potential.\nAfter meeting Tamer and her current adventurer party’s roster, they immediately headed to a quest.\nSeveral goblins appeared in the distance, flying with their wings, shooting and running backward in repetitive motion.\nMatthew pointed at the hills around them and the river flanking them. “Be careful. We might get choked here. Let’s stay here, slowly moving to get a better view. In fact, let’s back off, the forest is behind us, and this clearing only leaves us vulnerable. The road to our right leads to a larger area, but it’s a large forest. That should be good if we’re planning to retreat, but we also cannot guarantee if they had prepared sufficiently for it. Moreover, it goes in the same cardinal direction as where the winged goblins are headed. Let’s focus on moving away as far as possible, moving backward where we’ve guaranteed control.”\nTamer nodded, emphasizing to her party members to follow Matthew’s lead.\nWhile heading back, various long-ranged skill projectiles flew in their direction from the far left, but they were mostly probing shots to check Matthew’s team’s vigilance during a strategic retreat.\nAfterwards, the winged goblins regained full control of the clearing; not having to contest with Matthew’s party for the road entry point.\nMatthew continued, “Let’s keep a wide angle to prevent the enemies from collapsing on us. But make sure we don’t stretch too wide that we cannot line up and charge one of the enemies’ flanks to get out of a collapse motion.”\nTamer reinforced Matthew’s concepts to the members, paraphrasing.\nThe enemies began moving and accumulating at the clearing, confident that could bait Matthew’s party in. But in case that didn’t happen, their goal anyway was to keep this objective secure. They didn’t have to force fights. They just needed to wait until one of Matthew’s members got caught. They had a lot of numbers, so they would focus their forces around in order to attack from behind. He already predicted where Matthew’s forces would end up and had the rear-attacking team head there to catch them off guard.\nMatthew’s forces quickly re-arranged themselves however, moving backward as much as they could to regain control and vision. They didn’t want to loosen up, so if their enemy was confident in their attack, they would reveal themselves.\nBut for now, Matthew wanted to focus on catching the first wave of enemies with the goal of baiting the rest of the enemies to reveal themselves. However, if the enemy knew that plan, they would keep hiding.\nIt was strategic straffing game.\nThe enemies continued down from the clearing, their main force centering from this direction.\nMatthew already knew and felt the pressure coming to them, seeing the members of his party grow nervous as the trees began to rustle from the clearing’s direction. He didn’t want to throw stray shots and miss, so he kept his skills off cooldown.\nOne of the members had a low-cooldown spell that offered a wide area-of-effect attack that could be used to prod for vision and poke enemies over a cone. So he stayed closest to the clearing to gather information and keep the enemy guessing, hiding, and dodging fire. This slowed them down.\nMatthew noticed that one of his members were drifting too far, so he beckoned him back.\nAnother member straffed too far, after one of the enemies shot a long-range skill at him. The member dodged, but he put himself to a vulnerable position surrounded by blind spots.\nMatthew immediately moved his troops that way, pressing the flank, predicting an enemy collapse from that direction.\nHe was right.\nAn ambush from various thickets and vegetation emerged to catch the member off guard.\nBut Matthew immediately had the healers and shielders protecting him. He also motioned the low-cooldown–spell member to keep applying fake pressure to keep the main enemy force guessing, while his team collapsed on the ambush force.\nThe ambush force was strong, being members with the competence to handle a large group. But since the main enemy force was still careful, they didn’t get too much.\nThe canopies were especially thick as well, and even if the goblins operated via the air, it was impossible for them to move without rainforest obstructions.\nIn the end, Matthew’s team rotated immediately, commanding his team to move forward toward the main enemy force and let out loud screams of alarm to match the reaction they would had if the ambush truly caught them off guard.\nThis baited the main enemy force to enter, while Matthew secured the high ground, killing them off one by one, since the main force entered in a hurry to collapse.\nSoon enough, Matthew’s team succeeded, but they still were not yet done.\nThey moved forward, keeping their focus on the trees and the flanks. The back was already much secure, and the large force was eliminated. So they focused on moving quickly to the clearing and keeping quiet in case more enemies were still there.\nWhen they arrived at the edges of the clearing and saw it was empty, they moved forward, climbing the hill flanking the road to the right and the river to the left.\nThey moved forward.\nTheir next priorities were establishing a foothold on this initial hill, which meant delegating control over the road entry point and a little over the edges of the clearing.\nCertainly, having his members consolidated sounded easier, but if the enemies continued to press the same strategies of a rear–flank attack like they did a while ago with their main force entering in to collapse after the fact, then at least he mitigated that risk.\nWith his main team advancing, he pointed out various various hiding spots in the form of gullies, vegetation, trees, knolls, and minor slopes with 3-meter sharp dirt faces. This was a congested jungle, but certain paths indicated regular traffic through this area from various directions.\nThey spread out horizontally, keeping their front unmarched because of the threat moving in a line posed in such an area. They kept spreading out, relying on the secured area at their far rear with the three members in the clearing.\nAfter clearing the area and establishing vision and control, they slowed down and stayed, watching.\nAfter several minutes, Matthew shot-called for the three members in the clearing to come and watch this cleared area instead to keep their changing flanks actively secure as they advanced.\nWhen they entered the front they avoided earlier, Matthew told the team to be trigger-ready in case one of the enemies appeared.\nAfter hearing a shuffle, one of the members began shooting at all the hiding spots.\nThis was reactive, and it wasn’t productive, only warning the enemy of their position.\nIn the distance, various long-range projectiles shot precisely in their direction, the sound of the member’s shots having facilitated this aim.\nMatthew called for a retreat, as a single individual from the enemy team charged, tanking all the skills thrown at her. All the other enemies accompanied this individual, “riding” along and using her as a hammer forward.\nThe individual was too fast, so Matthew immediately got his team to dodge sideways.\nThe individual kept charging after missing, but she stopped soon after, now covering their rear.\nMatthew’s team had been separated into two flanks, but because he had three high-damage area-of-effect skills [Solipsistic Slaughter], he told his team to charge the rest of the enemies and ignore the tank.\nThey first regrouped and then charged, collapsing on the enemies while the tank tried to catch up.\nMatthew used all his skills. His teammates were mostly fighters with one-vs-one competence, even the healers and shielders, with some expections like the low-cooldown–skill member.\nThe enemies were swiftly repeated to shreds, while the tank failed to catch up. His back-to-front strategy as a tank failed. In the end, his fragile-bodied backline was ripped to shreds, having relied solely on the tank “taunting” the enemy team to distract while his backline shot from the newly emerged rear.\nMatthew punished this efficiently with his skills, notably having weakened the backline’s armor and magic resistance by 20 with [Cattle Decapitation].\nWith the backline defeated, they turned to the now-useless frontline tank.\nWith that victory secured, they rested first before covering the various strategic points of the area and creating a nice playground for them to bait enemies into.\nBut they were exhausted, low on health, low on mana, and had barely any of their ultimate skills.\nThey returned home.\nTamer was impressed, celebrating the victory at the guild. They were now more respected members of the guild with their newfound importance in the region strategically. This victory over the area, albeit small, placed a dent to the enemy’s plannings.\nIf the rankings and the guild gave them an honorable mention somehow, they would accept it with pride.\nShe was most glad about Matthew’s shot-calling and committed leadership throughout the whole process, despite the lack of communication previously had between her and the team. Even if the team hadn’t practiced and trained much together, Matthew’s decisiveness secured them the win twice in both fights. This was the epitome of grace and beauty.\nIf Matthew had used his skills out of timing, they would have lost the final battle, so she was glad that despite the lack of information, Matthew was now a much more confident risk taker, being more aware and adaptable with respect to his enemy’s strengths and capacity to take damage.\nMatthew focused his attention on skills and treading the path of leveling carefully. With his victory empowering him, he grabbed 10, a portion of his levels, and placed it into a new blade—a ghost blade, that which dealt necrotic damage similar to Michel. This blade came from her actually; furthermore, she mentioned that it would offer him a big discount with levels since it relied more on killing enemies rather than the experience gained from them. Basically, it was a cheap, broken item.\nMatthew looked at the edged blade he now had in his palm, having being gifted it by Michel in a package. He placed it again into the package to showcase to her.\nWhen they met, Tamer and Michel were quick to celebrate their progress as a party, now thinking of color themes, insignia, and banners. It was a celebratory mood, and Matthew didn’t want to mention the deaths of some of the members.\nSome of the members did indeed die, but Tamer was more so focused on their victory to care about it.\nMatthew shook his head and focused on their victory. Even if people died, he could die as well. So why was it advisable for him to grieve when he could smile with their spirits clanging triumphantly within him?\nWhen Matthew showed the blade, Tamer immediately had her goblin touch it in case.\nNewly enchanted blades had a chance of making the first creature that touched it bleed from the hand. So she was careful about this.\nAfter Michel saw it, she rushed to explain that the ghost blade had to be used once a week—something she didn’t say before.\nMatthew squinted with disappointment, but he nodded, recognizing that he didn’t actually tell her that he would buy it. After so long, he got excited all of a sudden. Maybe, it was an impulsive buy, but he wasn’t going to let this day of using his levels finally be a let-down.\nHe went to a nearby dungeon to test his new blade.\nChapter 42 - The Ghost Blade’s Legacy and Strategic Insights linkAt the dungeon, he slashed a goblin to the ground in a series of attacks that kept it displaced and unable to summon up a counter-attack. He demolished it.\nFor context, his swords and spears usually only added around 25 to 40 damage, and this ghost blade was almost no different, topping out at 60 damage. But it also included an active skill and a passive skill.\nThe [System], grinning behind the scenes, showed him the blade in [System] form as requested.\nName: Michel’s Ghost Blade\nStats:\n+60 Attack Damage\nPassive - Necrotic Affliction:\nBasic attacks apply a stack of Necrotic Affliction to the target for 4 seconds, stacking up to 5 times. Each stack reduces the target’s armor and magic resistance by 2%. At maximum stacks, the target is also afflicted with Grievous Wounds, reducing incoming healing and regeneration effects by 40%.\nActive - Necrotic Surge:\nEmpower your next basic attack within 5 seconds to unleash a necrotic-infused strike, dealing 50 (+40% bonus AD) bonus physical damage and consuming all stacks of Necrotic Affliction. Each stack consumed increases the damage by 20% and extends the duration of Grievous Wounds by 1 second, up to a maximum of 3 additional seconds.\nBefore the fight with Tamer, he already had placed his points into [Health].\nHe gained only a total of 200 XP from the two fights with her.\nThis would be his stats after the fight with Tamer if he didn’t place his stats before the fight.\nName: Matthew Cruz\nLevel: 49\nCurrent experience: 29\nSpecies: Human\nAge: 25\nSkills: [Whirlwind Waltz], [Cattle Decapitation], [Solipsistic Slaughter]\nSpells: None / None\nVitality: 15\nQuests: [Bridge of Knowledge]\nTitles: [Goblin Slayer], [Skeleton Slayer], [Overlord’s Gifted]\nUnused stat points: 302.2\nAttack Damage🪓: 85 + (10 from [Strength Beacon])\nAbility Power🔥: 27\nArmor🛡️: 57\nMagic Resistance🚫: 60\nHealth🗿: 906\nMana💧: 311\nMana regeneration💧 (per 10 minutes): 7\nBut that wasn’t the case. He used up 54.6 stat points on mana to get 39 more mana and reach a total of 350 mana since the mana cost of his three skills combined was 350. He didn’t want to rely on mana potions anymore, considering he spent so much gold buying them. Anyway, 54.6 cut down his 247.2 to 192.6, which he sunk into health, gaining 223 more health and reaching a new total of 1129 health, with 0.36 unused stat points remaining.\nAnyway, when it came to his [Attack Damage], which was interchangeable with [Strength] here, he had 145 attack aamage now with his ghost blade. Moreover, he had the [Goblin Slayer] title, which increased his damage against goblins by 12%. So his total damage in this case was 162.4 and could increase or decrease in terms of output depending on how well he slashed.\nSo he shredded through generic goblin health in 3 hits or fewer, since they had around 500 health.\nReturning to reality, the next goblin in front of him stopped, raising its arms. “I’m not your common gob, please, don’t kill me,” it said.\nMatthew watched the goblin’s mouth, but he couldn’t comprehend what the goblin was saying. He could understand it, but for some reason, he couldn’t “hear” it. Nothing in him decried goblin killing.\nIn fact, he sliced and stabbed and crushed the goblin, ensuring that whatever he said next was in the afterlife.\nHe didn’t want to bother with any more goblins. But in the distance, the [System] saw his hand shaking, rubbing his head with displeasure.\nThe next day, after he returned to the party, he taught Tamer about strategy and tactics, answering questions and getting her up to speed to an initial degree. As a result, she quickly summarized her findings from the day before, seeking to learn from him more and more. Having been with Matthew for a while, she picked up on the way he described things, using his terms and adding her own perspective as well.\nIt began with the question: “What is the reason for the loss of the enemy team in the second fight?”\nShe said: “It’s likely that they were overconfident and overreliant on a list of things being true, basically a well-oiled machine. The issue was that their powerful strategy didn’t make room for any mistakes, so as soon as they encountered a threat that adapted appropriately, they lost in a landslide. The fact that they can’t just respawn like a wraith makes this even more severe, since they can’t just learn that lesson and restart the fight again. They cannot perform well weak side basically, overreliant on early game strong side strategies. The fact that the main force in the fight before that did the same thing—lack of communication between ambush force and main enemy force. But the ambush force was also surprised, not taking into account the possibility that they could be detected. It was a very rewarding strategy, but it backfired so badly. Same super well-oiled machine.”\nEven now, she still had the more casual side to her, amid her more poetic side: “What a splendid food we have today!”\nThe fact that she had been a child bride for two years added a back face to her various aspects as a human being.\nAnyway, Matthew decried the loss opportunity to have the goblin enemies from the two fights fall under his leadership. He could have trained them, streamlining their strengths and trimming the impact of their weaknesses through his active direction. The cool tank was especially tempting. But imprisoning the goblins just wouldn’t work: they were going to fighting to the death. It was sad, a lost opportunity. But loss would always be part of the journey really.\nThough he added to the conversation, using his past experience playing League of Lagands among the top 500 in his region even while being a top academic performer: “It makes sense. In League of Lagends, one of the things new players do is get used to fighting certain match-ups, but it also depends on the skill level of the enemy players. If a new even better player emerges, then it’s often a very quick loss where one has to limit test. That’s how improvement happens in League of Lagends. Get used to one’s champion pool, different matchups, team compositions, player skill levels, and weak side and strong side. But these goblins were not used to fighting very good enemies, having some strategy to some degree. But they probably don’t have a diverse pool of strategies like a champion pool. They haven’t gotten used to different match-ups likely that much. They haven’t probably had the chance to train and fight other team compositions, considering the difference in power that adventurers had over goblins. They couldn’t just practice with and watch adventurers to get better. They fought blind or avoided fighting. They didn’t practice with different player skill levels both on the micro and the macro. They didn’t get used to playing weak side, having relied on staying on top in the early game—relying on the first strike of the ambush and the first strike of the tank charging in and taunting the enemies with the backline shooting from the rear. In conclusion, the goblins were severely underprepared, while I had lots of personal experience in fighting goblins, all the goblins he fought dying or traumatized instead of learning from his micro fighting skills. The fact that I had gone on many different quests makes it even harder to goblins to gauge who the enemies are. They don’t know about I had lots of experience tactically and as a solo fighter. So it makes all the sense why they lost.”\nAfter finishing up the discussion with Tamer, he returned to the cottage to reflect.\nEventually, he went to the adventurer guild where he could meet his friends for a dungeon raid. He imaged the cafe, the inn, the bazaar, and the various familiar places that he now called his home.\nHe took a deep breath, sighting the various colors in the air and the way the trees swayed in the wind. The wind was strong, the sky was clear, and the air was hot. He was thirsty, so he drank from a pouch that he soon bought a refill.\nMeanwhile, at the guild, a familiar group of adventurers waited: a barbarian, a foot soldier, a red dwarf, an archer, an elven spearman, a beastman, and a bard. Additionally, their hushed voices in the echo of the guild lobby and various chagrins over various quests and obligations added to the adventurous, determined mood.\nHe scheduled with them a multi-party event that included his friends. It was set two weeks from now.\nIn the meantime, he visited all his friends one by one. He did the same thing he did with Drakekiller Rollingthunder.\nAfter taking the time to clarify past events and interactions and reset their rapport to a clear and clean slate, he left, heading to a blacksmith shop to have his equipment assessed.\nHe had always delegated the obligation to handle weapons and equipment to procurement specialists during coalitions and had the young credentialed blacksmiths at the guild do maintenance repairs on his equipment.\nBut now, he wanted to have a tailored evalution done on his stats, hoping to connect with a stats evaluator through the blacksmith. Rodney’s team actually suggested to do this.\nIndeed, Tamer’s book didn’t really help him with stats, skills, magic. But it was interesting, so he kept it for now.\nWith that said, when he finally got a meeting with a stats evaluation, he explained past events and the kinds of quests he had been on, getting a surprised “Wow” when he mentioned the two fights with Tamer’s party.\nNow that the evaluator had context, he said: “You can try focusing on finding ways to strengthen your healing. Health is good, but healing is much more effective in the long term. However, increasing your ability power won’t increase your healing, but if you continue to work with the [System] quests and focus on getting titles and other [System] mechanics, it will reward you. I suggest you focus on committing to [Bridge of Knowledge]. Since you excel in teamfights, I suggest you keep doing that. That should give you a team quest with a healing upgrade for a reward. Your solo adventuring is good too. Usually, you would put your stat points to armor since your enemies rely on physical damage, but you have [Overlord’s Gifted]. So it’s good that you’re putting points into health. What I can add to that is to find stronger enemies with skills that you can kill since they give a skill point for each skill they had. That should allow you to experiment with your path much better.”\nIt wasn’t advice that Matthew didn’t already know. The only thing he didn’t know was the healing part. But the fact that he confirmed that killing enemies did give a skill point for each skill they had made things a little complicated. Almost all the goblins he encountered didn’t give skill points. So none of them had skills. And the only enemies that did give him skills in the past were human beings—the crazy “adventurers” that tortured him.\nAnyway, because of the evaluator’s statements, he decided to visit a more difficult dungeon, one situated much lower. The lower the dungeon was in terms of elevation, the more challenging the enemies were.\nSo he gathered Tamer’s party again. The roster had completely changed except for Tamer, and now it was a new set of individuals whom Matthew had to learn how to adapt to.\nThey were heading on a dungeon raid, but it wasn’t a quest. So what they would do was purely for adventuring, leveling, and testing the waters.\nIf this failed, then they would have to make sure they escaped.\nIn the end, these lower dungeons were much easier to monitor since they were often in low-lying, high-risk, flood-prone areas. So monsters that escaped to the surface were often assaulted by the elements. However, they could still leak out, which made their presence a threat to those living nearby.\nThe good thing was that they were uncoordinated, which made them easy to pick off one by one for stronger adventurer parties.\nThis was why Matthew and Tamer’s party were not alone here in this new area, outside of the beginner zones.\nChapter 43 - Expanding Horizons linkAt the entrance of one of the harder dungeons—and this was after Matthew had liquified the loot from the previous quest with Tamer’s party—he brought a lot of mana potions and barrels full of holy water.\nTamer stared at the dungeon, and she nodded, using her [Break Barrel].\nThey threw the barrel one by one.\nThe monsters dodged them easily, surfacing immediately.\nMatthew abandoned the plan and retreated home. Tamer’s skill [Marching Tire], which slowed enemies by 20% for 2 seconds, helped them escape.\nThey had planned to kill the monsters without direct interaction with Tamer’s skill. But it failed miserably. Moreover, none of the new roster members had a ranged skill.\nInstead of returning to the dungeon, they moved their focus to the scheduled dungeon quest with the seven adventurers.\nFor now, however, they went to the market.\nHauberks, shields, helms, brassairts, vambraces, gauntlets, gambesons, cuisses, greaves, and sollerets were offered at the stalls within the marketplace. Moreover, they included red potions, blue potions, one-use spell manuscripts,\nBut they also offered specialized fortification making service—basically spike-makers at duty, using agility and high precision.\nAfter seeing this well-rounded assortment, Matthew realized that his pattern of adventuring was too narrow. While he might be collaborating with all kinds of adventurers, it would be good to expand his interests beyond this bubble. Though, fixing up connections could be difficult, especially since many people were challenging to work with. His current friends, especially, were difficult to get moving around: they had their own goals, priorities, and cycles.\nIn the end, if he wanted to move forward, it would be good to integrate further into the guild and establish a stronger presence with its partners. So he set up a meeting with Rodney and Desmond. Both had a vested interest in keeping a strong clasp on him.\nAt the meeting, he declared a list of priorities he had in mind, that being setting up various different dungeon coalitions in order to help detect monsters roaming around the region.\nRodney immediately informed him that warders specialized in keeping vision over the region were already doing that.\nDesmond added that these specialized warders collaborated with monster wardens, those who ensured careful management toward sustainability over dungeons.\nMatthew was surprised, since he only learned that now.\nEven now, having lived here for almost five months, it felt like he still didn’t understand anything, and it was only due to the [System]’s help that he was able to excel this much.\nBut the [System] was unreliable; for instance, he still remembered the time the [System] nerfed [Whirlwind Waltz]. But it didn’t make too much of a difference, or at least that was what he wanted to say.\nAnyway, Matthew decided now would be a good time to clarify things about the world.\nHe asked if there was a magical green hue that might teleport people, since that was the one that transported him here to this world.\nRodney and Desmond said they didn’t know, shaking his head with a concerned look. It was rare for them to be given a question they didn’t know. In addition, when it did happen, usually it was because it involved entities from beyond this region.\nHe also asked whether goblins could spawn with hidden, dangerous attributes.\nRodney said that it was very rare, adding it was safer to pretend to see goblins as they were on the surface. To explain, he said, “Goblins who do end up showing hidden, dangerous attributes usually get moved away to carry out more larger tasks. And currently, the goblins right now that you see are fodder enemies because of the natural stalement between them and humans. In the end, no matter raiding a few dungeons won’t magically make them disappear. They hide and crawl within the lands like insurgents.”\nMatthew raised his brows, holding his chair tightly.\n“Why did the [System] weaken my first skill?”\nIt was Rodney and Desmond’s turn to stare wide-eyed.\n“What do you mean?” Rodney said, regaining his composure. “I’ve never heard of that before.”\n“He talks to me frequently, appearing in a human form,” Matthew described.\nDesmond never regained his composure. “What do you mean?” he said, keeping his voice low.\nMatthew froze, throwing a 1000-yard stare at the surface of the table.\n“I didn’t know…” he said, his voice toneless.\nDesmond saw Rodney’s expression before he composed himself. “What is it—when did it start?”\nMatthew said that it was some time after he first came to the city.\nDesmond leaned back onto his chair after having pulled himself forward.\nRodney continued to sit politely, but a drop of sweat was already traversing down the side of his face.\nThe silence went on for a while.\n“Is he…?” Desmond glanced around.\nMatthew nodded, confirming that the [System] was behind him.\nThe [System], having followed Matthew all this time since their last conversation, was levitating in the air, his arms crossed, wearing a smirk.\nMatthew’s distraught eyes contrasted the looming presence the [System] had long established.\nDesmond and Rodney were the spectators.\nBut they soon got to work, heading to a communication device called an impisces. They soon reached their hubs and reported Matthew’s condition, one of the people they contacted being a person called “Bishop Dan.”\nAfterward, they returned to their seat, waiting for Matthew to say any more.\nMatthew asked what the goblin list that he heard when he first came here was. Talking about the [System] reminded him of how weak he used to be.\nHe glanced at a farmer coming into the cafe and saw him holding a harvesting scepter that he soon tucked into a tailored bag.\nMatthew saw the various versions of himself flash through his mind.\nSeveral days later, at the guild, after a short discussion with the adventurers, Matthew smiled and followed them to a dungeon alongside Tamer’s party. In the meantime, he wanted to distract himself, even while feeling like a captive.\nIt was a dungeon steps meshed with an outpost and a cave leading underground. It was a complex structural assortment, but it served as a way to navigate this particularly steep place reliant on bridges and staircases for traffic.\nNumerous travelers passed through here, those who would have gone to the second city Matthew had visited if their destination lay in that direction.\nEven here, numerous people took advantage of this place as a waypoint within the city and set up stalls on the sides.\nLooking over the bridges and cliffs led Matthew to see the various houses and building strewn the lower montane land.\nEventually, they entered a second dungeon steps a long distance away from the first one.\nThe way to the steps was guarded and heavily fortified with many goblins positioned at a camp.\nMatthew’s team immediately set up camp as well in close proximity. It was a place of narrow terrain with little paths and only one clearing leading to the steps itself. The steps was surrounded by large, sloping forests.\nThe fortifications of the goblins came first in the form of spikes arranged in a line and pointed forward diagonally to block cavalry charges—cheval de frise. But cavalry was atypical because adventurers were often going through dense jungle. Ultimately, the goblins were highly prepared.\nThe fortifications came second and third as trenches and arranged branches with sharpened ends facing forward. These trenches were also littered with stakes and other sharpened objectives.\nEven if the terrain was only slightly bumpy, the goblins were also situated behind a knoll, so a palisade line effectively blocked the way to the steps.\nThe adventurers could go around another way, but it was mountainous and would slow them down a lot. This gave the goblins plenty of time.\nIn the end, Matthew was only here to harass the enemy and test their defences.\nHe contacted the guild and requested for the proposed coalition that he told Rodney, Desmond, and the guild two days ago.\nSoon, Matthew watched the distance, as the rain poured. The muddy terrain would make it impossible for them.\nHe decided to leave, but one of the adventurers informed him that the smaller dungeon steps nearby was ripe for the taking, as many of the goblins had gone here.\nWhen the coalition that Matthew requested arrived, it wasn’t that many, but it was enough to give the illusion of a larger force here at this camp.\nSo Matthew, the seven adventurers, and Tamer’s party detached from the main force and moved toward the smaller dungeon steps.\nIt was undefended, so he immediately went up the steps. Once there, he saw that this one had holes leading inside. It was more like an ant hill than a staircase. Moreover, it was a vertical drop from the surface of the dungeon steps where the adventurers were to the inside.\nA group of goblins emerged under the holes. Accompanying them were giant ants. They had tamed these creatures, but they hated the light. So they beckoned the adventurers inside, even if it was an obvious bait.\nThe adventurers kept their distance, maintaining the stalemate.\nMatthew directed the archers to shoot in a volley.\nThe goblins got hit, many of them dying, but they soon hastily and clumsily got their shields up. It was an arrogant gesture in the first place.\nMatthew noticed that one of the goblins was coughing.\nIn the end, he motioned for a bow to shoot at it, but a shield blocked the arrow.\nThe goblin soon fell to the ground. It lay still, breathing weakly.\nMatthew raised his brow. “What strategic value did this give?” he said.\nMatthew had not tamed a shield yet, but he knew that the mages could easily break it.\nSo he got several mages to toss heavy attacks like catapults and flamethrowers.\nThe mantlet shields were more durable than he thought. In fact, if the goblins were smart, they probably held them so conceitedly because they wanted to bait the mages to waste their spells. Ultimately, Matthew might have made a mistake, leaving the skills of those several mages on cooldown.\nHe declared, “It’s going to be a slow game today guys. Let’s rest for now.”\nThe goblins placed awkwardly a ward and retreated.\nMatthew saw that this dungeon was fortified inside. Since his team had the high ground advantage, instead of greeding, the adventurers immediately knew to get comfortable and prepare for monsters to probe and attack from outside the steps.\nThis was an objective, so it was up to Matthew to defend it and affix it further.\nThe good thing was that even without a more formal coalition, Matthew’s presence here was very rewarding and confident.\nThough, much of it would be fake pressure if the monsters really rallied their troops and mobilized effectively without taking consequences in the rest of the monster-human war, they would stomp his team out.\nIn the end, if Matthew’s team succeeded, the monsters would be zoned out and forced to contest this objective or rotate around to other objectives. If they were less organized, they would just run around and look uselessly for fights with little concern for secondary routes of advance. In addition, the only other two dungeon steps available nearby included the first one that Matthew visited earlier before coming here.\nMatthew was banking on the fact that goblins were bad at the game.\nSo the goblins might have baited him. However, he was the one baiting them now to fight under two illusions: that he could enter into the dungeon steps and completely eliminate the goblins inside, and, two, that they could successfully collapse on them from two prongs because that was where Matthew had an advantage. Certainly, if they did so, he would immediately sweep them—both the outside forces and the forces inside the steps.\nIn contrast, as mentioned earlier, if the monsters gathered enough troops, Matthew would lose.\nIn order to make the enemies inside the steps believe they were too strong to fight, he and his team began entering the holes, charging at the goblins.\nThe goblins retreated further inside, escaping through holes that led outside.\nMatthew was right. The goblins, if sufficiently scared, would retreat even if they held the advantage. Though, he wondered if his menacing reputation had an impact here.\nIn the end, the outside forces didn’t attack, running back to their other objectives.\nWith the dungeon steps conquered, he stretched out back to the dungeon steps with the human outpost, easily finding purchase onto the city authority.\nThis and the camp would create two prongs of pressure against the first fortified dungeon steps, the one he left earlier to attack this one. They would also act as staging grounds for projections of power.\nFinally, Matthew returned home, eating and drinking with his fellow adventures to celebrate.\nThe resources expended were many, but this also alleviated some pressure on other fronts of the monster-human war that had gone on for millennia.\nMatthew’s next goal was to return to the simple things, so he decided to return to square one, visiting the beginner areas.\nHe wore a mask and removed his familiar purple and yellow outfit, opting for brown and white.\nHe disappeared into the masses.\nChapter 44 - Echoes of Redemption: The Mask Unveiled linkSo Matthew was left alone, and he entered into the land of beginners.\nWhen he came to his senses, he said, “I realize now that I am alive.”\nFrom there, he entered into a cave, finding himself enraptured by the sights.\nAs he neared the Fourth Ring, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.\nThe goblins went up out of hiding ready for battle.\nWhen the goblins reached the edge of his range, he slashed them with Michel’s Ghost Blade.\nHe moved as if he was levitating, creating waves across the cave floor.\nAnd it came to pass, when Matthew had ended these sayings, the goblins were astonished at his words, for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the adventurers.\nAs cold waters to a thirsty soul, the goblins were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had struck them.\nAnd they fell at his feet as dead; and every living soul died in this sea of goblins.\nEven without skills, his sword fighting prowess was growing; though, he always used his longer spear first to test out enemy positionings, rotations, and intentions. This could be used to create some initial playing ground, especially in a fight between 1 adventurer and 10 goblins. Then, once the movements of the goblins were carefully analyzed, using the sword would be much easier. Of course, since he was bad at the sword, cleaning up most of the more proactive goblins with the spear before using the sword was more effective.\nSimilarly and more importantly, having battle experience as a warder, he placed wards on the way here to keep his rear within vision. Since he had vulnerable flanks and blindspots, he placed wards there too. But his wards were limited.\nIn the end, this was how he cleared goblins systematically. Definitely, his bravado, grandiosity, and joint methodical operations overshadowed this.\nWith his head space free from malice, he returned to where the beginners gathered outside the dungeons.\nIn those dungeons, he had gone deep, and it was mostly empty.\nTo elaborate on how horrid it was to watch the goblins fight, earlier, even if they were more than the baseline, the goblins that he killed were disorganized and barely functioning in terms of coordination and communication. First, one went in without waiting for the other. Second, one went in and took a life-taking risk for barely any reward. Three, they failed to synchronize their attacks and skills. Four, they neglected adapting to his more nuanced exchange of attacks. Five, they stayed still in order to get a more precise attack at him, which only left them practically one tap away from death. Six, out of reactivity, they attack when he’s ready to respond and stay back when he’s not. Seven, they separated, executing a flanking manuever with the main force remaining behind to keep an anchor, but the flanking force took needlessly long and winding paths. Eight, despite having separated, the reduced main force fought him anyway before the flank could rotate to the enemy’s rear.\nIt was hard to watch anyone with bad macro. There was practically no counter to bad macro.\nHeading into the main attraction of the land of beginners, Matthew came face to face with a beginner, who saw him emerge out of the dungeons.\nHe glanced for a while, passing by.\nThe beginner stared at him, wondering whether he was a beginner too. It didn’t feel like the man wearing a mask was. Anyone who wore a mask was automatically someone with something to hide.\nTo extend this idea to a broader topic, masks were only worn by immigrants who felt comfortable anonymous here. Moreover, masks were called “ID tags,” because it was a clear sign that someone was an immigrant. Faces were distinct features that people took seriously, since monsters and their “ugly”, “disgusting” faces prompted reflection into what determined humanness. And the face was the most prominent symbol of that. To tie this idea to the mask, the mask served as a way for immigrants to blend into the society in a way that didn’t make their faces the target of the problem. Their foreign faces, as a symbol of humanness and potential monsterness due to how different they looked, were kept hidden and anonymous to have discrimination fall weakly toward the mask like an egg to a rock. Truly, since goblins and other humanoid monsters looked too similar to humans, people had to find a way to avoid thinking that goblins were humans. So the distinctness of the faces of foreign humans in their similarity to the interplay between goblin and human faces broke this illusion. In other words, humans would feel guilt if they felt that monsters were humans. So as a byproduct of separating goblins, who looked very close to humans, from humans, they became aversive toward foreign faces in the aspect that foreign faces carried a similarity to the closeness between goblin and human faces.\nContinuing the commentary, it was a fantastical way to express social differences. In general, people might feel threatened by those who were perceived as different yet similar enough to blur the lines of distinction potentially. It spoke to the human tendency to categorize and differentiate between humanness and monsterness, even when the differences were superficial or constructed. This was a strong case for why humans fought each other, and it was only rearing its ugly head in this fantasy world.\nBut even now, Matthew was working toward alleviating this, even if he killed goblins just a moment ago.\nTo address whether he was still a human being with empathy and a soul inside rather than a blanket of strategy, tactics, and battle, he was working hard to ensure that he was prepared to face threats, so he dampened his emotion and put it on a sun dry for a while. Maybe, it would find ideas worth putting on the surface. For now, he would wait. Morals could wait. He could wait. His soul could wait. His spirit could wait.\nHe would become a human soon enough.\nBut every now and then, when he stayed up for hours, the thoughts “Am I horrible?” and “Who am I again?” lingered and cycled through his head.\nIt was the least he could do to maintain his sense of self, amid the greatness of his reign.\nZipline zip!—emotions dispersed.\nHe got up and aimed his focus toward the horizon, walking forward, raising his arm onward.\nSoon, the goblins saw him, trembling.\nHe slashed them as a robot would, crushing their brutal lives and becoming their Creator.\nHe mashed them together and smashed them, crashing them, loathing them, turning them upside-down, and making them.\nHe played them as with toys, removing them completely before building them back up again.\nHe threw them aside, dashing forward.\nHe grabbed a goblin’s dying head and punched it on the temple. “I cannot let you do this to me.” He kicked it on the stomach before making a wound. He couldn’t slash it part. But he could slice a bleeding wound across his upper torso and then watch it die patiently.\nHe tore them apart with his mind before gripping his sword and slashing out anyway.\nHe would not be satisfied by a half-assed attempt at warfare. He would not flinch at the sight of a bloodied hand reaching out to him.\nHe would not care.\nHe wouldn’t.\n“I am me. Stop laughing!” He broke them and crushed them apart, ripping them to shreds, laying them asunder.\nHe magnified their vulnerabilities and broke them time and time again, committing violence against the sacred covenant of the living God.\nBut he was an apostate and simultaneously a remarkable definition of Great Power—that divine essence which sundered, remarked, and reinvented human qualities, manifesting in the form of violent retribution (repetition).\nHe unleashed his wave of chaos, removing them, turning them askew, asking them aside before crushing their very hopes. He would not relent until his “self” was satisfied.\nHe was a maniac seeking vengeance for a lost life.\nThese goblins took that away from him. They were the first, and they imprinted on him like a person with a puppy. He would become a father-killer and destroy the covenant of Jacob the Messiah.\nHe was Jacob of Messiah, because the apple never fell far from the tree.\nThe goblins were the original Jacob of Messiah, and he was passing on the torch.\nHe rendered them so askew and in ruins that it was like a blackhole.\nHe manifested his fist, and he launched it, crashing down in a ball of flames.\nHe removed their essences time and time again.\nHe was beating a dead horse, but he was beating sorely and patiently and with ease. Nothing stopped him from this relentless assault.\nHe tortured the very goblins who had tortured him.\nHe was freedom in his punches (movements). He was grace in his unyielding assault. He was manifestation upon manifestation, for every action he did was made manifest. He bulldozered his way into the spines, ripping it to shreds.\nHe would no longer live by this creed of violence any longer. He would live by salvation. And he was freeing them, scattering away the essences of weakness. He was freeing them from this dilapitated light.\nHe rested on the seventh day of the fifth month.\nEmptied of his rage and despair, but experiencing the great personal cost, he growled, moving through the meadow. His eyes saw the great light, and he was astonished. And it came to pass, when the men of adventurer were in the field, that Matthew rose up against the adventurers his brothers, and slew them.\nBut that wasn’t true: he didn’t kill them. To be more exact, he couldn’t.\nThe beginner adventurers, with a more rational mind, with enough teamwork, stunned him long enough to shackle him magically.\nThey finally found a good use for that rope skill.\n“Haha,” said one of the adventurers, Finnegan “Finn” Swiftwater. “It was nice getting all of that though. I imagine that we could have been the ones fixing—arranging it. I guess we’ll never know, huh.”\n“But yeah,” said Isadora “Izzy” Wildwood. “imagine if it actually came to pass. We would be nuts. I’m honestly… I was honestly scared there. Was he one of them?”\n“Who?” said Declan “Dex” Stoneheart.\n“A ‘blasted’ adventurer?” said Lila “Lark” Moonshadow.\n“I don’t know,” said Elias “Eli” Sunfire. “Seems like it. But still… we have to get to the guild fast. If we don’t fix this guy, he’ll be doomed.”\n“Why care about him though? He tried to literally kill us—” said Finn.\n“But we don’t want to make this any more complicated than it already is,” said Izzy. “He was probably burned out. Who knows? The guy must have been struggling with the recent war, and now he’s crazy. I don’t know. Maybe, he’s not crazy, and it was just a spell… of craziness.”\n“I don’t know,” said Finn.\n“I don’t know either,” said Izzy.\nThey brought Matthew to the guild and got him fixed up. It turned out that his mind was slightly weakened. So they got a mage to exercise some magical psychological surgery to remove those icky parts. It failed though, given that Matthew’s issue was resistant to those kind of changes, having intergrated his psychology deep into these more ickier parts of him.\nIn the end, they had him sit down when he woke up, telling him to eat and drink enough water.\nMatthew nodded. He asked for forgiveness, addressing his faults in detail and explaining the possible reasons behind his sudden lapse of thought without using Earth terminology that they couldn’t understand.\nThe adventurers were fine with what he said, resolving the issue immediately.\nIt was one check off a check list for them.\nBut to Matthew, he almost killed people, even he had killed human bandits. They had the right to kill him, but they didn’t. He saw it as them being kind to him. Though, moving on to the adventurers’ perspective, it was more testy to kill an adventurer—even if they were a bandit—than it was to put constraints on them. So it was a good thing they had the rope skill.\nTo give one possible explanation, the kindness that Matthew had extended to others returned to him. But that might just be a saying.\nHe remembered one of the things the adventurers said when his brain was still foggy and heavy: “You need help, Matthew. You can’t do this alone. We’ll be the ones to give you that help.”\nMatthew nodded and said okay. Even though the last fight ended in failure, his act of showmanship was still successful, even if it stemmed from a traumatic break. He was trying to get that voice out of him without giving in fully to the trauma. This way, he could get that almost messianic quality without losing himself completely to a psychosis-like state. This was all a part of his plan, but it was an opportunistic play on his part, since he could only proactively exploit it when his emotions arose, signalling the opportunity to strike for a theatrical, larger-than-life demonstration.\nHe really wasn’t going to kill the adventurers, but he thought that in order to realize the act fully, he had to immerse himself into the character and persona. So he allowed his emotions to surge until he was tittering at the edge of losing everything.\nTo simplify, the traumatic break and the violent outbursts against the goblins and the beginner adventurers were intentional.\nIn truth, first, this was who he was—the greatness of the stars accompanied him.\nSecond, he was truly a human being.\nLastly, he grinned; snickering gleefully.\nChapter 45 - Masking the Darkness Within linkMatthew stopped walking, weakened. He was too weak. He couldn’t do anything.\nBut he slashed the wind, crushing its momentum and removing its stride. It flogged its shaking attempts to stand up, delivering the final on four different corners, deliberately dismantling it corner by corner until it was truly out of support. He then removed it of life.\nIn the silence, he contemplated the existence of its castration and its manning with hundreds of souls that came prior to its ruining all together. He would not stop with that. He would reap as much as possible.\nThis was his dominance against the Wind.\nHe prepared himself.\nThis vial of expressions was his more surreal, introspective self returning: it matched hands and locked eyes with the other self that succeeded in this world.\nReturning to adventuring, he clasped hands with Tamer once again, their friendship unrivalled in the vicinity of the guild. Even now, their presence was strengthened, any succeeding roster of Tamer’s party only adding to their progression.\nThey entered the shadow of the dungeon, where hundreds of beasts roamed with quick steps.\nThe sun soon reached its peak, and sweat became a common theme among men.\nBut Matthew and Tamer had prepared, bringing their own potions to deal with the heat.\nThis was the Special Heat-Remover 99! Only buyable in stalls near them!\nNow that the two were comfortable, they bungee-jumped into the dungeon, Tamer readying her cheap, low-cooldown skills, Mark priming his sword for business.\nMatthew immediately knew that the monsters had little in the way of vision, having gotten comfortable with the state of the dungeon. This particular dungeon they were in was one of the more challenging dungeons, so they had to be more careful and quiet this time around.\nOne of the monsters came into sight, but Matthew and Tamer were quicker to hide, having pressed against the holes in the wall. Here, they were capable of planning their next moves.\nTamer prepared her two skills [Marching Tire] and [Remove Clothes], targeting the first goblin that came into view.\nThe goblin was slowed, and his armor and clothes were promptly removed.\nMatthew struck him as one having authority, ridding him of his form and essence like a man battling the sun.\nThe goblin’s form was quickly removed, while Mark and Tamer returned to their hiding spots.\nMeanwhile, Tamer’s party got the signal to enter the dungeon, making sounds.\nThe monsters immediately ran to them, passing by Matthew and Tamer.\nMatthew and Tamer waited until the team escaped and the monsters returned to their positions.\nNow that was over, the two learned of the various enemies within the cave, their power levels, behavior, speed, and many other details. Then, they went out of the cave quietly, relaying the information to the team.\nMatthew had planned this, but without Tamer’s skills, he wouldn’t have been able to strike the goblin roaming around that would have alarmed the rest of the monsters.\nTamer was instrumental, and her party would soon make an appearance.\nFor now, Matthew hid in the shadows, his face covered by a mask.\nSoon enough, the monsters noticed them, but Matthew was prepared, targeting the key threats among the monster crowd.\nShooting them down as arrows of god, Matthew struck them all one by one, proving his prowess in stunting their development into the fight.\nThe goblins under Tamer’s authority went hand-to-hand with the lesser goblins who hadn’t been trained under human guidance.\nThe enemy goblins were felled, and the rest of the monsters under the weight of Matthew’s fury.\nThe rest of Tamer’s team were the hands and feet of Matthew. Basically, while he was stuck creating a zone of no entry, the team shot down and targeted the stray key threats, soon enough devouring the side of the monster crowd like a man eating freshly baked bread.\nMatthew fell aside, his progress coming to a halt.\nThe monsters retreated however, ending the fight with a stalemate. If the worth of controlling the dungeon was going to be effectual immediately, it would have been a victory to drive them out. But it wasn’t, and it was a mere trip down to a dungeon that would soon become filled again with monsters.\nAt least Matthew got some XP.\nGreat job on defeating that solo goblin!

I guess we’re next to a mountain, and it’s already late afternoon. But it’s still early I—”\nHe was struck on the temples.\nDeathbringer immediately used his skill, holding a dark sword with fire emanating from it, his form gigantic due to a skill that increased muscle mass temporarily. He used it early to spin-charge the first pre-strike he found. It was also a cheap skill, being very strong for situations like these.\nThe man who commanded the Wind with a raised arm, Matthew, had laced his blade with poison, having stabbed Deathbringer. But it was not going to kill him. He had tested it himself.\nThen, Deathbringer, during his charge, fell to the ground, groaning. Why did he fall again to this same thing? Why?\nBut that was not the point.\nMatthew back-handed him with his ghost blade, striking Deathbringer on the head.\nDeathbringer fell again to the ground.\nThe point was that Matthew had to emphasize to Deathbringer that they were on the same level.\nMatthew offered his hand.\nDeathbringer, although frustrated, found hope in that grip.\nThey both stood up, hands clasped.\nSoon, the tide went in a new direction. Deathbringer, Michel, Brandon, Brackern, Kairo, Nova, Ella, Prism, Jayce, Ada, Echo, and Richard continued onward, while Matthew stood by, journeying by himself. But he had finally restored the equilibrium for himself.\nWhen he was alone at an inn room, Matthew grinned manically.\nHe raised his hand before lowering it hesitantly.\nEventually, he found himself at three more quests with three different adventurer parties, having gained the reputation of a reliable hand-raising leader.\nMatthew disappeared into this masked leader.\nHis form regaining anew.\nHe opened a new door and found himself at the highest point of a hill, slashing goblins crawling up toward him.\nThe rest of his adventurer parties on his first quest were making their way to him, since Matthew was supposed to be the one handling only one side of the enemy force. But the goblins had invested all their members to gang-catch him.\nMatthew raised his hand; Soon enough, the skills from above fell, originating from the his fellow adventurer parties.\nThe goblins were pushed down to the earth level, and the adventurers swarmed them.\nMatthew used his first spell today, after the [System] gave him it.\nIt was [Flash], and it teleported him a short distance.\nOn the second quest, the goblins ran all over one division of his party members, striking them one by one.\nBut Matthew ran, being fast enough. He commanded his accompying adventurers to heal and shield them.\nThe goblins soon found themselves unable to break up the division, retreating up a hill.\nMatthew directed them to give up to the stalement, watching them with a forlorn gaze, seeing the crawling adventurers and the top of the mountain.\nOn his third quest, Matthew finished after an easy sweep. They didn’t even need him to participate in direct combat, but the adventurers did need confidence and some mentoring with strategy essentials. It felt more like a training session to him if anything.\nBut this was the first series of quests where he felt that he was expected to excel beyond that of the common man (adventurer).\nUltimately, it served its own slice of piece within the broader shapes of his goals, if not an exciting avenue on its own.\nBut Matthew didn’t want to remain a leader. His progress would be stunted like he stunted those monsters earlier.\nSo his next actions would involve arranging various avenues of progression—currently, he had solo adventuring. But his pattern revolved around checking the middle-level dungeons in the area and attacking only the cream of the pie, basically the top and surface of the dungeon where the enemies were weakest and least effectively positioned. Even if goblins exerted some control over the general area of their dungeons, most of the goblins specialized in cave-dwelling and tunnel infrastructure, so any effort toward the surface required a special force. And that was why his efforts there was the cream of the pie. However, for progression as a warrior, he could visit other avenues suggested by his fellow adventurers. For one, he could try joining the tournaments in addition to solo adventuring; he could also incorporate different kinds of dungeons. He also went for the typical beginner-friendly dungeons, but the more challenging dungeons beyond the surface level involved challenges that transported adventurers to portal-created realms with unique threats, rules, and enemies. However, he could also keep grinding down the typical dungeon route until he found harder enemies with skills on their own. The issue was that most of the goblins especially had skills that had negligible impact since they died too fast to do anything.\nThis was his current setup.\nIncidentally, Deathbringer, although good-natured and faithful to the cause of adventuring, had lost his spark, ever since his marriage and especially his wife’s death. But Matthew cared about him. This was why with his new avenues of progression, at a stall at the marketplace near the bazaar where Deathbringer’s friends worked, Matthew met Deathbringer and had him join up to improve as well alongside him.\nSoon, they were at a hill, observing the forest. They couldn’t see the landscape much, blocked by other hills and mountains. However, they could see the general area, including the valley where goblins traversed. Even though they were unmatched at almost every front, goblins still committed to their goals of bringing food home. It was a testament to their dedication and determination as providers.\nBut Matthew didn’t want to focus too much on that element of morality.\nMore importantly, the goblins were unaware of Matthew and Deathbringer’s presence.\nAnd they separated into their own tents, since they were on a long journey and using this small place as a ground for training as well. It was a valley, so it was dangerous, and they lacked scouts. But they stayed here, risking their safety, because they were exhausted and in need of a break. The sun continued to blaze them.\nSuddenly, Matthew and Deathbringer struck them one by one, killing them off in threes since they were seperated by over 10 meters of distance in threes.\nThe element of surprise was crucial, and the iterative defeat in detail ramped up until the goblins were forced to retreat.\nCollecting the various items and piling them up in the middle of the camp, Matthew and Deathbringer were surprised to see that the goblins were watching them from afar. They were pressed from all sides, and all their things were there in the camp, especially their sun-heated armor.\nDeathbringer didn’t think too much to help them, watching them at his peripheral view like one would do with a dog.\nMatthew did the same, sitting down and resting for a while, pouring over himself the Special Heat-Remover 99 that was recently introduced to the marketplace and handing it to Deathbringer, who poured it over himself too.\nThis was their resting place for now.\nTo finish, it was a clear precedent that Matthew was quicker around the map and smarter around the map, setting up earlier. This was why in all of the prior fights, he led the teams to victory.\nChapter 46 - The Fresh Slate: Matthew’s Downfall and Resolve linkA young man observed Matthew from afar, having seen him move here and there. He was updated with the recent events at the guild, and he also knew about how Matthew started. He had been collecting information on him for the past month, so he hoped to learn from him.\nHe was visiting him today.\nMatthew stood, his expression still, his cloak large, the aura around him that of superiority and a sense of diligence. Eventually, he sat down, resting his leg atop the other, his arm grabbing the edges of his table. He was talking to two women and asking her how he could help the efforts of a new settlement, with the shadow of an older man behind them.\nShifting to background context, having seen Matthew do great feats, Tamer only had to show to her academy Matthew’s feats, and she was immediately allowed to refocus her academic priorities toward studying Matthew as part of a tailored project of education. This was why Tamer was not alone this time. The older man behind them had the the clothes of an rogue. He sat down next to Matthew, he looked outside, his eyes carrying that feeling of centuries of reflection.\nReturning to the young man’s perspective, his nickname was “Rogernaki.” He soon overheard that the older man was an older adventurer nicknamed “Basewars,” while the other woman beside Tamer was Michel, the rare necromancer.\nBased on looks, Michel was in her thirties, while the older man was in his sixties. Matthew looked the youngest, probably in his mid-twenties, while Tamer, wearing her academy uniform, was likely in her early twenties. For context, schooling started a little later in this world.\nContinuing this line of contextualization, as for why Matthew didn’t apply, it was complicated. He could apply, but he would be investing a lot in order to do so. At his current state, he received a lot just being that neighborhood super-adventurer. At this point, it was advisable for him to continue exploring adventuring until he was toe-to-toe with his seniors. At the moment, he was currently only ranked at Iron, which meant that he wasn’t strong whatsoever if you compared him to Bronze and Gold. The city he was in was a city for Iron adventurers. That was why petty goblins were often the enemy.\nThe higher-ranked adventurers made sure that the adventurers in lower-ranked cities didn’t get their level of monsters. That was why they made sure to keep the dungeons clean and weak. They didn’t want to kill the ecosystem of weaker monsters, but they did look for the stronger ones like humans did to certain animal threats until they became extinct back on Earth. This was the natural distribution of power between adventurers and monsters.\nBut Matthew had indeed met Bronze-ranked veteran adventurers, but his recent quests involved the weaker bracket of Iron adventurers. This was why he looked divine in comparison. But the climb was steep, and he would only grow farther, his hands reaching out with jealousy and deep-seated rage (ambition).\nThe arrogant faces of the higher-ranked adventurers didn’t even look at him when he showed his great passion, their chins as uppity as usual—even if it was only in his mind.\nHe would not stand down.\nHe saw where he was at compared to the higher ranks; from Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Emerald, Diamond, Masters, Grandmaster, to Challenger.\nMeanwhile, Rogernaki, the young man watching him, sighted several kids outside, as they played without a care in the world. They played their favorite games, and they did well. But they had potential far beyond their imaginations.\nWhen Rogernaki looked at Matthew, he soon two different phases of life. He realized he was lost out of this progression. His life consisted of him working the same day jobs. But he wished he could reach for the stars, even if he also wanted to live a simple life. It was a familiar notion, one shared by the thousands of citizens living in the city, one marking through the generations.\nThe kids continued to play, and they lived normal enough lives to enjoy themselves for many years.\nRogernaki stood up and left, returning to his boring job. But even if it was, he, alongside many others, carried the weight needed to sustain this society—an essential worker in a grand web of political machinations and power plays. Ambition was Matthew’s name, and he would soon penetrate this web.\nRogernaki disappeared, swallowed by Matthew’s ambition.\nMatthew stood up, watching the glowing effect on Michel, Tamer, and Basewars’ outline. This imagined glow signalled how close they were to being swallowed up as well.\nA grin played on his lips. Even if he was laughing at a joke made by Michel, to him, this grin referred to something greater.\nMatthew stood at the seat of power.\nAdventurers coalescing for his greatness.\nHe commanded different columns of the guild hierarchy.\nHe walked toward the horizon, jealous of its glory. He sought to monopolize it with a fierce glare.\nA familiar older man watched him, seeing the emotions Matthew so well inside.\nMatthew was getting too strong.\nFor some reason, Matthew looked around him, as if remembering something. But he soon returned to drinking.\nHis awareness was cutting short.\nBefore it truly did disappear, he grabbed it and put it down.\nLong after parting ways with Michel, Tamer, and Basewars, taking a deep breath, he couldn’t sleep after lying lazily and in a splayed out manner on the floor of his inn room.\nHe stood up before heading to Sophia’s grave.\nHe cried for a while.\nBefore he returned back.\nHe watched the sun.\nHe sat down in front of the older man.\n“What was that you did? You built a tavern.”\nThe older man smiled and froze. He grabbed Matthew and took away his levels and skills with a certain skill. For context, it was originally a very rare skill intended for skill practitioners to help people start fresh and reset their build path, but the older man used it aggressively.\nReturning to the moment, Matthew fell to the ground. “Huh?” he said.\nThe older man tried to kill him, but a passing adventurer removed the stun effect on Matthew and healed him.\nThe older man disappeared.\nMatthew stood up, alone in a vast world, the adventurer who had saved him running to assess his health.\nHe looked around, his expression in a flurry. His laugh was sweet and syruppy.\nBut it definitely spoke of a larger plan in mind.\nThe [System] appeared. “I can’t help you,” he said before disappearing.\nMatthew gritted his mind, feeling himself exploding in hundreds of ways.\nOne lapse of focus and trust in a stranger destroyed all his progress. After all the trust he gave people, this older man decided to ruin that streak of give-and-take. He just took and took.\n“God giveth, and God taketh away,” he said sarcastically before holding in a punch once he returned back at the cottage.\nA group of adventures approached his cottage, surrounding him.\nWhen they entered, Matthew had his arms leaning against his hips, his head lowered and staring at the ground.\nThey helped and comforted him.\nMatthew’s expression was that of rage all throughout.\nHe repeatedly expressed his anger at how unfair his situation was, adding that bad guys always got away with it.\nLater, after the adventurers left, he went deep into the forest and let out his anger at a goblin, his emotions in a flurry.\nAs his emotions whirled, he ran around, finding himself at Drakekiller’s cottage.\nEventually, there, he smiled, appreciating her comfortable place.\nDrakekiller gave Matthew a kitten, asking him to help it while she did something.\nMatthew saw the problem and grabbed a cloth from a nearby table, damping the cloth.\nThe problem was that the kitten’s right eye was closed tight due to an obstruction.\nHe placed the damp cloth against the kitten’s right eye and slowly removed the green sticky discharge. The kitten struggled at first, preventing him, but he became more intentional and streamlined with his holding, finally removing the discharge and allowing the kitten to see again from the right eye.\nAfter Drakekiller returned, Matthew saw that she had a daughter, and he politely nodded toward her. But he kept his distance, fearing the fact that he was a man in this situation. “Drakekiller… Why did you let me come here?” he said. “And why do you live alone?”\nDrakekiller smiled, placing a hand on her daughter’s head. Her daughter was drinking water with both hands. “Why shouldn’t I?” She furrowed her brows, maintaining her smile, magical blue particles emerging from her nails for a brief moment.\nAfter seeing the child, a flood of memories entered Matthew’s mind, and he instinctly knew the truth.\nHe was afraid of what his hands could do, and he was afraid of children because he was afraid of himself.\nHe couldn’t stop himself or control himself.\nHe was an addict.\nEven after all this time, he was still human, but he was sure that anything could happen. And he wouldn’t be able to stop it from happening.\nAnd for some reason, the daughter looked a lot like Sophia with her ponytail.\nHe couldn’t share his fear and guilt. In his mind, Sophia was looking at him and pointing a shaming finger at him, accusing him.\nTears dripped down his cheeks. “I’m sorry, lady.” He stood up and walked away. He couldn’t help but realize that he was a male monster.\nHe left the area, and after a long breakdown that involved self-hurt, he rested back at his cottage.\nExtending his loss to a more objective outlook, his loss was not necessarily his fault. He prioritized his brain power on adventuring, loosening up to network and make connections with all kinds of people. Moreover, even if he might have been grandiose, it was all to motivate him and keep that persona going. The older man was just antisocial enough to do something like that in public without reason. Blaming Matthew would be equivalent to blaming the victim of a serial killer.\nAs for his loss of levels and skills, it wasn’t all bad. It would be a fresh slate, which meant that he could choose different skills this time and be more intentional unlike before. This time, he had many friends that he could ask for help easily now that much time passed since his arrival here on this new world. However, removing skills was probably possible with certain artifacts maybe.\nIn the end, maybe, living life day-to-day was better. So he thought to visit a familiar person—Zoey.\nZoey had the title [Master of the Basics], having helped beginners in the land of beginners for some time now. She was also a musician.\nMatthew wanted to follow in her footsteps for now, since he never really learned how to live like a regular adventurer in this world. He was already thrust into parties and given power and responsibilities from the start, giving little time to get in touch with most adventurers who had to start from the beginning.\nBut part of him felt offended. He had gone through so much, but he had to start again.\nIt was like an senior developer being told he had to add a new programming language to his repertoire from the start, because if not, he would be soon replaced by younger, cheaper, modernized, more ambitious developers.\nBut Matthew knew that his past experiences would prove strikingly enlightening moving forward in this new phase, now that he had addressed everything.\nTwo concepts were crucial here. One, a man in touch with his soul was an unhesitant agent. Two, levels, stats, strategy, tactics, integrating more people, a streamlined focus on improving himself, intermittent fights, his showman persona, and a more positive direction would still be relevant, despite his regression.\nHe would bounce back again.\nDespite their complex, toxic relationship, the [System] rewarded his resilience.\nYou have gained the title [Calm Walker]. All calming and mindfulness effects on you is increased by 10%!\nChapter 47 - The Humbling linkMatthew slowly gravitated toward the beginner areas, finding out that thousands of families made it their living to be an adventurer. When he expressed his prowess in those previous succession of quests as a director of sorts, it happened in a vacuum, not really leaving a dent in the overall guild. In reality, many adventurers did similarly impressive things, even if not in an approach as distinct as one revolving around a finesse for strategy. And it wasn’t as if Matthew knew how all battles played out, so his strategies and tactics were done in a specialized container like a man knowing well his backyard but not knowing any other backyard and how to navigate them.\nWhen he found out about how many people were climbing up the beginner ranks and creating various parties day in and day out at rapid speed, it was something he had seen before.\nBut still, engaging with a community and living alongside them was different than being passing by the community through the main road once a month. The fact that he had been spending most of his time with senior adventurers like Deathbringer and Sophia made it so that his time growing from zero was negligible. And he forced to learn how to fight with more senior concerns in mind. But that also resulted in some gaps in his training, such as being able to cope with killing goblins, something that beginners had to go through and learn to get used to overtime. Matthew was forced to watch goblin fights at a larger scale than what beginners were gradually exposed to, leaving him lopsided and asymmetrical.\nMoving onto another topic, as for what happened to that earlier adventure he had with Deathbringer, they decided to call it off after Matthew felt quesy. The area was particularly steep and full of hills and mountains in the distance. The slopes were not so easily identifiable too because of how forested they were. Moreover, goblins were not the only creatures that roamed the forest, so Matthew still had to be careful. Long-tailed macaques (monkeys), deers, small mammals, lizards, snakes, turtles, and other animals. The reason why he felt quesy despite his past travels was for two reasons. One, Deathbringer didn’t have the same level of experience Matthew’s previous travel companions, Liam and Elena, had. Two, this particular area they were in was harder to navigate with much less vision and very much like a chokepoint. So Matthew, even after stealing away the goblin camp, decided to move on and take their leave that time.\nAnyway, with all that laid out, Matthew was currently in the beginner areas, approaching Zoey, who held the title [Master of the Basics].\nZoey said, “Okay, now I know usually, you’d be focusing on grand plans, but today, you’re just going to chop trees in this area. This is an open area, and you aren’t going to head into a deep, dark cave. I just need you to stay here at this community and chop down the trees nearby. Don’t worry. These trees respawn every so often. They are monsters actually, and that’s why they do this. But they are just trees as well. So just chop down these trees and bring it to the sawmill right over there. You’ll get one gold coin for every log. So start cutting.”\nMatthew’s face dropped, but he shook his head and said okay with enthusiasm.\nSeeing his responsiveness, Zoey continued: “Also, I’ll hand you a wallet where you could hold your money. It can contain only 15 gold coins. Do not use any other wallet. I want you to get used to not having anything special to make your progress easier. I want you to relax and focus only on guiding your mind through the steps smoothly. I know you’ve proven yourself, but take this opportunity and treat this as a retreat if it seems too humbling.”\nAfterwards, Zoey led him to a shop and had him pick up an axe there before leading him outside to a group of trees. “Cut this tree. It’ll take five swings with that special axe.”\nMatthew attacked the tree five times. But nothing happened.\nZoey explained, “Stop attacking the tree. If you’re trying to hit the tree as if it were an enemy, it won’t work.”\nMatthew had the what-is-this-bullshit written all over his face.\nZoey smiled and showed him how to do it, grabbing Matthew’s axe and hitting the tree five times as if it was guiding a baby to sleep. Then, the tree fell, yielding one log.\nMatthew didn’t really get it, but he wondered if the [System] had to do with this hit-five-times-and-get-one-log mechanic.\nHe shook his head, trying not to show how dismissive he was of this. But the fact that he was selectively dismissive of this made him take a moment to reflect. He could accept the idea of the [System] benefitting him, but now he called bullshit when it did something that he felt was too strange. What determined “strangeness”? What determined sense? Geometry? Balance? What if the [System] was like a human? Contradictory? Hypocritical? Unreliable? What if it did things because it wanted to?\nWhat if Matthew did things because he wanted to and not necessarily because a certain group of people told him it made sense or not?\nHe realized that maybe cutting trees was a better activity and that it was better to turn off his mind and stop questioning the [System]. The Kindness Quest should have been the last straw for him, but even now, he still tried to make sense of something so unpredictable. It was just like spending time with people in general.\nIn the end, he closed his mind and opened up only one part of his brain—the automatic tree-cutting part.\nHe cut a tree and brought the log to a the sawmill, yielding one gold coin.\nAfter cutting 4 trees, he was already tired, so he explored around the beginner area.\nHe entered a weapons shop with a man wearing a viking helmet at the counter. He sold cutlasses, more standard swords, flinklocks, blunderbusses, and pirate hooks. The room consisted of a table with a book on top and two chairs on both sides, a chest next to the door, a cabinet for holding weapons vertically, an anvil, a crucible, a water drum, a sword rank on the wall behind the man, a shelf with various food and drink containers, and some metal bars at a corner, among other things. The shop even had a dagger sign outside.\nHe entered a wallet shop that sold a 10-gold small wallet that could contain 25 gold, a 20-gold medium wallet that could contain 50 gold, a 45-gold large wallet that could contain 75 gold, and a 70-gold huge wallet that could contain 100 gold.\nHe entered a shipbroker store, but when the man asked, he told him that he didn’t have a ship to sell.\nHe entered a fishing shack where a man wore a squid for a hat, and he sold fishing rods that costed 3 gold coins.\nHe entered a bank, and when he learned that it was stored magically, he decided to deposit his money there.\nAfter walking around for a while, he bought a canoe for only one gold and decided to travel only nearby.\nHe noticed that since a while ago, the wallet that Zoey gave him had been magically filling with gold overtime. Every so often, the [System] notified him that he received one gold from the dwarven mines. Then, a gold coin magically teleported to the wallet.\n+1 Gold (Drarven Goldmine)\nHe said: “So this is why Zoey gave me this. But seriously, can’t I use any other container? If I get all these money, why not bring the entire nation to go here and claim all these money? Unless the money is limited, and I’m only getting these because I’m a beginner. And that if everyone chased after beginner benefits without the actual corresponding increase in economic productivity, then the worth of the gold coin will fall.”\nThe [System] was being a little annoying right now, or maybe it was the system that beginners played a role in without realizing the potential consequences of. But it was likely because of mechanics outside of his imagination and understanding right now.\nIf he chose to sit down and do nothing and collected benefits without actually doing anything for the economy, he might benefit, but the economy wouldn’t.\nIn the end, he realized that he had to work hard today and cut as much logs as possible. But now he wondered whether spending time here was sufficiently proportionate to the amount of economic productivity he contributed when he was still an adventurer. Cutting down logs was essential, but in terms of proportion, leading adventurer parties to fight goblin threats with his high level of specialization was likely more productive.\nSo he decided not to have the beginner level phase and jump straight to what he was good at. Education’s goal was to promote growth and development and not to hinder them. But still, he felt that he could learn a lot from working as a beginner, which would contribute to his overall effectiveness and leave him more adaptable and well-rounded. So he eventually told Zoey that he would only be staying temporarily instead of going through the whole process.\nHowever, Zoey said that she wasn’t planning on making him go through the whole process anyway. She had an approach tailored specifically for him.\nHe thanked her, glad that he didn’t have to deal with an obstinate person. It was nice to see someone better than him in that regard. For a long time, being obstinate his one of the ways he dealt with the effects of displacement.\nSo he looked at Zoey as someone he could potentially trust as a close ally.\nReturning to the main topic, Zoey explained that the goal of making him cut trees today was to test his resolve and resilience amid shifts in priorities. That was her rationale. As for what she had next for him, she said it would involve making him confront his dependence on others as a leader. She said he would be visiting the lower dungeons of the beginner areas—something he had never done before.\n“By the way, this is off topic, but can I buy the blunderbuss?” Matthew said.\n“Sure!” said Zoey, smiling at him and trying her best not to let her personal feelings get in the way of work. As mentioned earlier, she liked him and had been excited that he approached her for help. It was good to see someone so tough show such a down-to-earth and boy-next-door side to him almost in an animal-loving way. Ironically, Matthew had killed goblins ruthlessly.\nMoving on to the next day, hours after Matthew woke up on the floor of the room on the second floor of the fishing shack, he and Zoey were in a cave, far away from any usual goblin threats. They had taken another path to avoid the goblins.\nMatthew held a blunderbuss, aiming it at the cave walls. “You sure goblins won’t be coming straight out of the walls with some artifact or something,” he said.\n“No, no,” said Zoey. “But that sounds like a good idea. We… or I mean me and the… Notrium group… should try that some time.”\nAs for the blunderbuss, Matthew had never shot a gun and a bow. The good thing was that a gun felt much more intuitive to hold, even if it was hard to reload, shoot, and aim a blunderbuss. In fact, archers hated the loud sound it gave off.\nThe good thing was that Matthew had magic on his side, but today, he would only hold it as a prop until he learned to use it effectively.\nAt the cave, Matthew held his spear, Zoey holding a sword behind him.\nAs for Zoey’s reason for joining Matthew, she was here despite her overall goal of helping beginners because it was Matthew who had approached her for help. It was her job to raise this up-and-coming adventurer who had shown himself to have high potential. Indeed, she had been tasked to help him out by the guild itself.\nSoon, a goblin leapt out, trying to assassinate Matthew.\nZoey stabbed it the way Matthew had imagined himself shooting a blunderbuss. It was quick, succinct, and right in the head.\nThe goblin fell to the ground, his body crawling before stopping forever.\nMatthew still didn’t know how to feel about that.\nZoey said, “Sorry, I didn’t think a goblin would be around these parts. I was hoping to show you the non-goblins today. There… are lots of non-humanoids that you can fight…” When she saw Matthew’s continuing discomfort, she trailed off.\nMatthew nodded. To hammer a point mentioned many times before, he was still battling the effects of his past experiences with goblins, and it didn’t just heal overnight like addiction. Sometimes, it took years before it ever felt manageable, and even then, it would never be truly gone, always simmering under the surface like a parasite. That was the reality of most people who went through war and any kind of trauma. It wasn’t pleasant, and it surely wasn’t something you could move on from by just attending a therapy session or church. Sometimes, the only thing one could do was learn to manage it, which often meant dealing with it but never fully curing it. This was why Matthew needed to keep himself present in the moment or distant wherever needed, almost adapting and preparing himself. This was how his strategy manifested—in avoiding triggers. The only thing people on the side could do was give time, space, and resources, the elements that could lead to stability.\nEarlier, Zoey instinctively shot at the head, but if she was prepared, she would have looked for a less disturbing way to go about neutralizing it. It would usually be a fun moment when it was among her closer friends, but with Matthew, it was like tiptoing on a tightrope between two towers.\nBut Matthew was worth fighting for. He had proven himself well enough, and even if he didn’t, he still deserved many more chances to prove himself.\nThis was Matthew. With all his flaws and his accompanying successes, that great symbol and that inner self that he hid so well only made him more human.\nZoey saw that, and she comforted him in the way she knew how.\nBecause of this, Matthew’s title [Calm Walker] activated, making Zoey’s comforting words 10% greater in effect. This led to him calming down enough that they could move forward one dungeon level deeper.\nNow that it was the sixth month, Matthew could no longer spend his time pretending, even if his levels and skills were gone.\nThe [System] was beckoning him to make a great feat with his eight [System] quest. Matthew had declined the earlier ones because he had not been able to handle them just yet.\nObjective: Embark on a perilous journey into the depths of the dungeon to reclaim your lost levels and skills by defeating the formidable troll that dwells within.\nDetails: Once a renowned hero, you find yourself stripped of your former glory, your levels drained and skills forgotten. However, rumors speak of a troll deep within the dungeon whose defeat holds the key to restoring what you have lost. With nothing but determination driving you forward, you must brave the dangers of the dungeon and face this formidable foe to reclaim your former strength.\nTask:\nRediscover: Navigate the treacherous corridors of the dungeon, retracing your steps and piecing together fragments of your lost memories and abilities.\nSeek Guidance: Seek out the wisdom of sages and scholars who may hold the secrets to regaining your lost levels and skills, guiding you on your quest for redemption.\nConfrontation: Confront the troll that lurks in the darkest depths of the dungeon, knowing that only by overcoming this mighty adversary can you hope to reclaim what was taken from you.\nTest of Resolve: Steel yourself for battle, facing the troll even in your diminished state. Let your determination and sheer willpower be your greatest weapons as you stand against the creature’s relentless onslaught.\nTriumph: Defeat the troll and reclaim your lost levels and skills, emerging from the depths of the dungeon stronger and more resilient than ever before.\nReward:\nRedemption: Restore your lost levels and skills, reclaiming your rightful place as a formidable hero in the eyes of the realm. Resurgence Title: Earn recognition as a symbol of resilience and perseverance, inspiring others with your triumphant return from the depths of despair. Relic of Renewal: Discover a powerful artifact within the troll’s lair, imbued with the magic of renewal and rebirth, symbolizing your newfound strength and resolve.\nHe thought the [System] was mocking him, so he couldn’t help himself. But he wasn’t really tempted. He honestly just wanted to see how strong the troll was.\nIt was here in the deeper levels of the dungeon, and Zoey was leading him there.\nChapter 48 - Revival of the Coalition: Confronting New Stronger Foes and Restoring Alliances linkMatthew slashed several goblins with his ghost sword.\nA goblin appeared before him, raising his arms grandiosely. “A goblin’s dream will never die!” A burst of red particles covered him, and he burst at Matthew. The particles healed him instantly each time he was damaged for a duration.\nMatthew would apply healing reduction with Michel’s Ghost Blade when he achieved the required 5 slashes on a single target, so he deftly avoided the goblin’s rending attacks, slashing him from the side after each of the goblin’s misses.\nAt five stacks, Matthew rended him and kicked him down, breaking his attempt to stand and crushing his fervor with a boot stomp.\nThe ghost blade fell down, neutralizing the foe.\nThe goblin’s body omitted an unusually pungent smell due to the red particles, so Matthew moved the carcass away.\nMeanwhile, Zoey ran in a circle, overwhelming the goblins by pushing them down with her staff and then stomping at them. She did in repetition, crushing the goblins collectively within 50 seconds. It took a long time to do, but she was the one leading the fight with 20 kills, while Matthew only had 5 kills. Though, he did fight the goblin boss.\nIn the end, Zoey and Matthew were skilled in their respective avenues.\nMatthew, despite lacking levels, retained his stats and the finesse he learned in strategy and combat. This was why he could easily slay a goblin with a powerful skill.\nTheir next foe was in a large chamber, but a complex strategy was not of the essence here. Matthew immediately drew the goblins to him to fight.\nZoey grabbed some rocks and threw them at the goblins playfully. She was powerful enough to charge and knock the goblins aside to clear the path for Matthew to kill the now haphazard crowd of goblins.\nMatthew struck one goblin before striking another using an unconventional angle. It was easy to strike in different ways when his blade killed enemies very quickly. Sometimes, the most efficient way to fight was unintuitive and looked funny.\nHe slashed again and again as if he was waving a stick. The goblins fell apart again and again, and sooner or later, the retreating goblins furthest away were caught and killed.\nZoey complimented him to keep his focus steadfast.\nThe [System] also complimented him with notifications.\nMatthew was already gaining speed in his combat confidence, similar to confidence in drawing.\nIt was like striking down an enemy fully knowing what the angle would be, what kind of shape the strike would make, how the goblin would respond emotionally, and where the goblin would dodge. Though, this level of ease only happened rarely.\nHe mostly killed his enemies with more clumsiness and raw power if anything.\nThe next cave involved goblins wearing more armor, so Matthew had to precise with his strikes.\nHe struck the goblin on the neck, bleeding it and watching it fall to the ground. The rest of the goblins charged, while Zoey threw a javelin that struck a line of several goblins that blocked the path of the rest.\nZoey nimbly crushed a goblin to shreds with her primed strength attack.\nBlocking, she struck a blade aside precisely and with a small point, utilizing both bruteness and accuracy.\nMatthew raged upon the streets of Zaun, removing goblins from existence by walloping them to the ground enough that they fell away from reality forever.\nHe tried to kick them, but the goblins took advantage of his awkward movement and struck at him.\nMatthew got up and bounced backward, healing himself and joining Zoey.\nZoey and Matthew made a more precise attack jointly, creating lines through the goblins in different points of the surrounding goblins.\nThe goblins soon fell away one by one, losing their provisional organization and becoming as thin as a branch in a thunderstorm.\nZoey finished off the last goblins, while Matthew sat down with a sigh.\nThe armored goblins soon fell away like the lesser unarmored goblins.\nThis was a confirmation of Matthew’s strength in numbers. Though, it was only two in this case.\nDungeons were easier to navigate compared to fighting goblins in goblin territory, especially when partnered with a master like Zoey.\nZoey was environmentally friendly in the sense that she knew her way around this place.\nMatthew was astounded each time he fought because he felt that Zoey was watching his back even when she wasn’t actually looking. It was this sense that she had efficient macro, one that didn’t require her to stare constantly. She integrated her information gathering techniques with her positioning, attacks, and special skills, overall making her a great fighter.\nMatthew never knew this, but it was nice to get a happy surprise.\nTheir next enemy were a giant flightless bats with strong, ripped arms that thunderously neutralized enemies with one fell swing.\nMatthew took advantage of their size and grabbed his blunderbuss, shooting at them. He missed two times, but on the third time, he struck gold, slamming a bullet straight into the bat’s head and making it explode.\nMatthew ran up and struck him before leaping back to avoid a sweeping strike.\nZoey dashed to Matthew to hand him several potions to throw at the bats.\nMatthew threw them, and some of the potions omitted smoke, while others exploded, creating a chaotic view for the bats.\nThe bats were unable to coordinate under this pressure and lack of vision and control over their environment. Instead of adjusting their positioning, they panicked and attacked randomly to zone Matthew and Zoey away.\nBut Zoey and Matthew loved this distance, using their javelins and blunderbuss to strike them down for good.\nThe bats yielded them lots of XP, and finally Matthew broke the limits of 100 XP.\nMatthew finally got a skill that complimented his fighting abilities—[Phantom Shield]. It was a defensive skill that allowed him to get into fights quicker and easier.\nThis way, he could rush into the site of attack and completely disrupt and displace his opponents without too much hesitation.\nZoey, as well, got a new skill, having spent years not getting much. Matthew’s presence made it easier for her to achieve greatness.\nThough, to say that Matthew alone was the cause was not true. In reality, Zoey collected skills a lot, and she had a long list of open slots for them. So she kept those slots open and discarded skills she never used. This way, whenever she killed enough enemies to warrant getting a skill, she would actually get it instead of not being notified by the [System] and given it due to having no open splots.\nMatthew did not really understand any of this, but he was glad they were finally moving on.\nThe next foe was a group of goblin heroes that paved the path for many goblin children forward, but Matthew and Zoey were here to end their cruelty once and for all.\nThe heroes saw them and began coordinating, talking among themselves.\nAfter one of the heroes waved his hands, a visible magic shield around the heroes appeared, discouraging Matthew and Zoey from attacking.\nSo at the moment, Zoey told Matthew to back off because it was not worth to challenge enemies with unknown powers.\nMatthew nodded, understanding.\nAt their next dungeon visit, their foe included giant earthworms and ants.\nMatthew was confused as to how to fight these opponents, having only won the giant bat fight earlier due to Zoey’s preparedness. The good thing was that Zoey was with him again.\nZoey told Matthew to strike down the earthworms’ sides and not their heads because they were more vulnerable there.\nMatthew obeyed, waiting until the earthworms launched at them before he struck his blades at the sides and made a slice through the worms’ side. The worm delivered the force necessary to make the slice easy.\nZoey did the same, taking down two, while Matthew only defeated one.\nThere had been three living earthworms in total.\nWith the earthworms defeated, the ants were next, so they prepared by shooting at them from afar to test their body armor.\nBut their attacks failed to penetrate, so they did the only other option of charging at them, dodging, and slicing their legs off.\nThe ants roared, casting a skill that created a light beam that struck the ground in front of them. Moreover, one ant casted a spell that made it three times bigger, though at the accidental expense of one of the ants. Another any casted a spell that summoned a terrifying spiky blade without a handle and controlled it telepathically.\nThe huge ant stomped toward Zoey and Matthew, forcing them to retreat.\nThe ants, sustaining the light beams, burned through Matthew’s head. The good thing was that Matthew had used his skill [Phantom Shield] that blocked 30% of the remaining damage. Moreover, he had been wearing a magic-resistant helmet that mitigated 65% of the damage after magic shield mitigation. These were two perks from preparation.\nAs a result, the light only dealt partial damage, so Matthew was able to heal himself again. But the damage was too huge, leaving him only partially healed.\nMatthew had to step back, while Zoey covered for him to escape.\nAfterwards, Zoey escaped as well, leaving at 100% health.\nShe noted that the earthworms were too powerful, so they focused their energy at the goblins for the meantime. But in order to do that, they were thinking of taking them prisoner.\nThey headed to a small area where they planned on baiting the goblins. They put down several goblin bodies and had them wear the goblin bat’s skin. It was a strange way to attract attention.\nBut it worked.\nThe goblins actually came close enough.\nAnd Matthew and Zoey came out, running faster than them and then imprisoning them.\nAfter forcing them to take part in an unreasonable magical contract, the goblins were made to get food from their camp and bring it to Matthew and Zoey.\nHowever, the enemy goblins were smart and killed off these goblins.\nDue to the failure of this strategy, Zoey felt greedy and suggested to charge at the goblin camp as an alternative approach.\nBut Matthew dissuaded her, saying that if the goblins knew they were coming, the element of surprise was gone. Thus, all that battle prowess that they exhibited in earlier fights due to that element would also be impacted. Basically, goblins could sort and order themselves by position, priority, and skill if they knew adventurers were coming. This would be a much more balanced fight strategy-wise, so Matthew did not want to risk it.\nBut to compromise, Matthew said that bringing in more people would make this camp takeover possible.\nZoey agreed, so Matthew invited Deathbringer, Tamer, Michel, Brandon, Brackern, Desmond, Lumi, Elara, Thorne, Elena, Liam, Kairo, Nova, Ella, Prism, Jayce, Ada, Echo, and Richard. Some of these were friends of friends, but eventually, they did all come together for the first time in a while.\nAt the guild, it was declared a coalition, since it consisted of at least 5 parties—including Desmond’s party, Thorne’s party, Tamer’s party, Michel’s party, and Nova’s party—not including the former parties. And it soon became a quest of importance after it was addressed, and Matthew’s name was mentioned. He was indeed a pillar in his own right. 5 parties wasn’t exactly a lot, but to have a reputation for setting up coalitions, even if it was only several, meant a lot to a guild in terms of accountability and regulation.\nThat was why Matthew was regularly visited by Rodney and his team to inform them regarding his future plans. In fact, when he lost his levels and skills, they were part of the adventurers who came to comfort him at his cottage, and they asked him about his future plans then.\nHe told them that he was motivated to make amends and start anew, delving deeper into his career as an adventurer. It was a professional statement, but it was all Rodney needed to see a committed employee moving forward.\nAnyway, now that the coalition was gathered, the camp raid was swift.\nAll Matthew had to do was keep his team together and have them take the relevant objectives. He needed to direct them in response to different variations in which the fight could go.\nAt the site where Zoey and Matthew last were, the coalition kept observing the camp, being regularly reciprocated by the goblins in the distance. An unusually long and relatively flat stretch of land lay between them.\nTo sum, it was never his levels and skills that drew people to him. It was his capacity for combat, strategy, tactics, and leadership that did.\nChapter 49 - The Witchman’s Grace: A Symphony of Destruction and Redemption linkMatthew’s coalition began moving, their steps careful, their eyes engaged, and their soul brimming with fervor, one backed by patience and a sense of purpose. Matthew united them under a common banner of having known him and seen him perform.\nHe was a dancer with a choir, and they were his choir, singing his songs and performing until he was fully done.\nThe crowd would go wild. His current crowd, a camp of goblins, would go wild when they saw him.\nHe raised his arms and commanded his troops, dancing along the path that led to the goblins.\nThe goblins released a volley of arrows, giving the adventurers pause.\nBut Matthew was quick, directing three teams that made up three prongs of attack. “Bait them to shoot again!” he ordered Team Dismantle with the intention of releasing pressure off his other teams.\nHe then directed Team Pincer: “Keep moving downward, keep their attention on you! And test their defences! Then, move around until you find an opening! If not, back off and delegate the damage soaking to Team Tank!”\nSimple, Team Dismantle worked at the flank. Second, Team Pincer worked more at the front but cautiously and embracing a ready strategy retreat. Third, Team Tank operated as the vanguard, but they didn’t appear until the defences were fully understood. And they knew where to position them for maximum impact on the fight. They couldn’t just waste the teams’ energy by making them run around in circles during an active skirmish.\nThe goblins were quickly dismantled, as the teams operated harmoniously, keeping communication lines with Matthew.\nMatthew was the first one to strike the door open, having been the one at the back and center where he could relay his orders from a vantage point. The goblins were too panicked to look for him, getting alarmingly close calls each time their defences were tested with a loud, powerful united attack by Team Pincer and made terrified of a flanking attack by Team Dismantle. The brutality in which Team Tank easily soaked up damage only proved to rip their composure to shreds.\nThe goblins were hunted one by one with little coordination in sight. Once the structured defence was breached, the goblins could only run around their camp, which had been streamlined toward an easy-come-easy-go approach with tents and food enough to pack up and leave quickly. The defences they had mustered were part of the permanent installations. In the end, the goblins went against the suggestion between them to retreat when they sighted Matthew and Zoey, resulting in their double-layered defeat rather than simply handing over of a strategic location. It could have been avoided, but they tried their best and lost. To explain their rationale behind staying, there was strategic value in it. It wasn’t like they didn’t see adventurers come by from time to time. But Matthew held a special position among the adventurers, and even if the goblins knew him as a figure, they didn’t know what he looked like by face. It was only when Matthew’s teams breached their defences that one of them considered the idea that Matthew might be present and leading the assault. It was far too late.\nUltimately, Matthew’s coalition’s role was complete, officially disbanding for its members to return to their routines and more personal objectives.\nMatthew and Zoey’s next priority was to establish a more permanent location here in this dungeon. With this increase in control, albeit temporary over the region, all they had to do was assign some form of force here in order to keep this location attended and within vision. So she took this suggestion to the leaders attending the beginners, who then took this notion to the guild. It was only the tip of the iceberg that represented the larger networks in which these organizations operated.\nAfterwards, Matthew and Zoey rested and reseted their focus before arriving at another dungeon the next day.\nThe giant ants that had defeated them were still in their minds, but for now, they would be operating in a smaller space with the same enemy goblins. It would be even more strategically important because the goblins had much advantage here. It reminded Matthew of his previous horrific solo raid at a goblin-infested dungeon.\nMatthew then walked up and crushed a goblin’s stride, tossing it apart.\nThe next goblins were quick, grabbin at him, but their limbs were exhausted and ripped to shreds.\nGoblin after goblin came, but they soon retreated, recognizing the Witchman.\n“It’s the Witchman!”\n“What’s that name? I didn’t know you had that name.” Zoey did know about it, but she didn’t dare pry.\nMatthew nodded. “I think I might have whispered it to someone, and the goblins picked it up.”\nZoey pretended not to know. Then, she caught the goblins and massacred them with all of her heart.\nThe basis that supplemented her strikes were useful, keeping her focus sharp and her emotions intact.\nWhile Zoey merely slashed with weapon-wielding fundamentals in mind, Matthew bifurcated his enemies, riding the momentum of grace and flaying them aside. He then punished them to Oblivion’s Grace.\nThe grandiosity in his actions were godly.\nThe orchestral sounds of heaven accompanied his ghost blade strikes, aiding him in his destiny toward removing goblins part by part and taking up space within the spiritual component within them. He ousted that space and became them, ripping that attached soul component and swallowing it.\nHe became the bringer of love.\nHe slashed with a rough, interrupted swing, crashing down only with his emotional nature.\nHe struck ravenously, his heart blurring through various flavors of defeat. In his mind, he was defeated, so the only true option was to unleash the frustration arising from this feeling through his actions.\nThe blade struck, flying across the horizon, capturing the sights of many.\nHe saw goblins moving in a dance, and he saw himself levitating, flying over them.\nThe goblins cried and bowed before him, crying “Holy, holy, holy, was the Witchman Almighty!”\nHe cried himself, watching the silence turn to blooms of flowery postures. He himself embodied this Spirit, becoming the epitome of grace and beauty.\nHe loved them, embracing them through the tip of his blade, slashing and flouring through them and making waves upon waves.\nThe silence was overwhelming, as Zoey watched.\nShe saw the spirit of the devil within those movements.\nIt was a devastating, beautiful idea to find beauty in violence.\nShe followed him cautiously, soon detaching her hesitation and joining his hand-raised fight.\nMatthew found that his grief had become beautiful.\nHe grieved through his blades, striking them down with a haphazard sense of purpose. He became the night, loving them and turning their fears into death. It was Death that was at fault. Not him!\nHe didn’t kill them. He freed them from their greatness of suffering.\nHe slashed them again and again like a child waving a stick. The ghost blade did most of the effort.\nBut this emotional dance soon became a theme that Zoey continued to follow and watch.\nMatthew came running; no more cries, no more pain, no more suffering.\nHe danced through them, phasing through their souls and collecting them overtime.\nHe became invisible, soulless, and unable to think.\nHe was in the zone.\nHe found his blade disappearing and his hands becoming the blade that struck the goblins.\nHe floated away.\nZoey watched him fly away metaphorcially.\nMatthew disappeared.\nBut after a short moment, he appeared again as if he was never transcendent or divine. He had been merely playing a role, a more introspective, grounded, simple, and easygoing man returning and taking form and role.\nMouth agape, Zoey placed a hand over her mouth. She comfirmed that she was enamoured of this man.\nThe man expressed his existence so casually. It was as if not a single thing could disconcert him. The gentle waves of the beach felt rageful in comparison to his gracefulness and great beauty.\nThe man smiled, standing poised: acknowledging his role in the cycle of life and death.\nMeanwhile, the goblins Matthew had left alive burst around a corner, hugging their only items. “Help,” one of them, Nanyaa, said, her eyes speeding toward Maydaysee, another goblin.\nMaydaysee said, “We can’t leave like this! How about Amarayaa!”\n“She’s dead,” Nanyaa said, slightly puking in her mouth. But she couldn’t puke. Her balance was crucial. If she got caught on the rocks like Amarayaa did, she would…\nShe couldn’t bear to think about it!\nMaydaysee grabbed the wall, motioning the rest of the retreating goblins in this one of two directions.\nOne of the goblins went the other way because her eyes were closed with grieving tears, forcing Maydaysee to grab her and redirect her.\nEventually, all the running goblins followed Maydaysee’s path, but those who crawled were left behind to suffer at the hands of a great killer.\n“Witchman.” It was the word that terrified hundreds of goblins and left them in terror.\nThe night sky was beautiful tonight incidentally.\nThey wished.\n“Maydaysee,” said Nanyaa, pointing. “Let’s go.”\nMaydaysee looked at her. Nanyaa pointed past the large line of goblins and toward the large mountain. “Let’s go through there. Witchman won’t see us there.” They had gone out of the dungeon through the entrance where the adventurers went, so now they were outside in human territory. The mountain pass was their best bet to get back to goblin ground.\n“Okay,” Maydaysee said with partial breaths. “I just left Amayaraa.” Her voice was full of grief. “I left her!” She bit back her tears, watching the line of goblins stop.\nA troll emerged in the distance.\nMaydaysee smiled.\nReturning to Witchman, Matthew looked at his [System] quest again.\nObjective: Embark on a perilous journey into the rainforest to reclaim your lost levels and skills by defeating the formidable troll that dwells within.\nHe realized that the quest changed its wording. It no longer said “dungeon” and read “rainforest.” This meant that the troll had gone outside while he wasn’t looking.\nHe made his way slowly, worried that Zoey was too exhausted to process.\nBut Zoey smiled, having drunk a potion for the heat.\nThey were still in the dungeon, inspecting around their current floor for any more goblins. But there were no more. And Matthew was worried that he had forgotten something such as food and other preparations. So he told Zoey that it was advisable to leave to reset. Zoey had decided that she would agree either way.\nSome time after they returned to the city, Matthew lay down until his head was perfectly placed on the inn bed. It had been a while since he lay down on a bed, having slept on the floor primarily. So he smiled for the first time since he left Zoey earlier. Honestly, he was glad to have Zoey by his side. The fact that she was so calm counterbalanced his more emotional disposition. And he knew that with proper planning, soon, he would become a better person. If Zoey could do it, then he could too.\nHe lay down and feel asleep, his thoughts becoming baby-like.\nThe same repeated words beamed throughout: “Am I a horrible person?”\nSoon after he woke up, he was approached at the guild by a group of adventurers. They were from different parties, serving as representatives. “Wow,” Matthew said, surprised at this new turn of events. “I’ve never seen this.”\n“Might you please help us?” said one of them, a girl with bunny ears.\nMatthew furrowed his brows instinctively, scared of women who wore bunny ears. It reminded him of the weirder side of the Internet.\n“S-sure, sure,” he said, smiling a little late. “I’d want to help you.” He sounded unsure there with his wording, but his tone indicated otherwise.\nThe representatives were glad to have him on board with them.\nMatthew checked first whether they had money to pay him. It had been a while since he earned plenty of money. So he was fishing for it right now. His progress reputationally didn’t necessarily denote immediate returns, so that was why he was being intentional and proactive with it.\nThe adventurers paid him in hard, tastable cash.\nHe got an urge to eat it when the adventurers asked if he was willing to eat with them before the members of each of their parties arrived.\nHe agreed, heading to an eatery and noticing how different this one was. It was very large, enough to fit a hundred people, so he was almost worried by how much it reminded him of eateries on Earth. The nostalgia hit him, and he found himself pondering.\nBut the new people’s voices kept him in check, sustaining a sense of bigger goals and plans. It was not just a group of parties gathered for a single purpose feel. It was a we-are-a-part-of-a-grand-religious-event kind of feel.\nHe felt the awesomeness influencing him as well enough that his voice sounded more broader in the sense that it was sustained with a more loftier and elevated weight and accent to it.\nHe raised his hands higher, and his expressions were more subtle, except for his eyes. His eye expressions were much more pronounced. It was just an effect.\nSoon enough, he found himself smirking alongside the men and women at the table, becoming a cowboy-like fellow.\nChapter 50 - Harnessing Lightning and Mastering the Fabric: Matthew’s Evolution as a Strategist linkMatthew watched the fall of a giant statue, seeing the adventurers pulling at it. This was a party event, but it looked like societal collapse.\nHe looked around, roaring alongside the adventurers as they finished this event’s version of a ribbon cut.\nAfterwards, he got to see adventurers lined up in an organized manner for a purpose distinct from taking quests.\nThey were here like a bunch of soldiers in a real time strategy game for him to control and marshal however way he wanted.\nThis was scary.\nBut this experience was necessary.\nHe did want to return to adventuring with Zoey. But he had to progress out of the box. The giant ants weren’t important anymore.\nWhat was important was being there when the opportunity arose.\nThis was that opportunity—“Tie the boat up and see how it spins first” he said. It was a directive imposed in view of the requirements of a skill belonging to one of the members.\nIt involved being able to use a boat as a torpedo if spun fast enough, so the adventurers were tasked with learning how to work with it by raising it with a rope and rotating it. This boat was not only a canoe. It was heavier and larger than a dinghy. It was meant to do something damage. To explain why it needed to be a boat, the skill was only effective when it was a boat that the [System] certified. It was a weird rule, but it made for funny interactions between the adventurers, who still had fun with the training.\nSooner or later, Matthew found himself wondering whether he was a fraud. He wasn’t some adventurer trainer officer. So what the hell was he doing? Who did he think he was?\nIn the end, he accepted this current situation, as he did with the concept of monster hunting.\nAfter the boat was spun fast enough, the member with the relevant skill cast it. As a result, the boat turned horizontal and shot forward, striking a tree in the distance.\nWith how heavy the boat was, the tree was absolutely destroyed.\nMatthew found himself smiling absentmindedly. It was the only way he could accept this sight.\nIn a test battle, they headed to a dungeon and lured out the goblins with a few adventurers.\nBut the goblins were wary and stayed inside the cave, having learned of the adventurers’ presence.\nAs a result, the adventurers moved to goblin territory and prepared an artillery attack, aiming the boat at the sky with the goal of hitting a goblin camp. They didn’t expect it to do damage, but they were confident it was going to spark fear into the minds of the goblin forces.\nWhen the boat struck after only 1 miss due to the boat skill caster’s mystically lengthy experience with it, the goblins found themselves at a lost. It had struck the left side of their camp, and now, adventurers were rushing in and slashing them apart.\nThe goblins were so few, and so many adventurers’ strategic value was used up beating them up. They thought it was a win for them, but the adventurers’s true goal was to test the boat skill attack and their coordination with each other and some of their skills.\nMoving onto the perspective of one of the goblins retreating from the adventurers,, running into the forest, her feet were becoming red with pain. She lifted them up and cursed, looking for a place to hide.\nAn axe flew, striking a nearby tree.\nThe goblin’s eyes were wide with terror, but she soon scurried past and around a path through the trees, disappearing.\nThe adventurers that came included the one who threw the axe. He was smiling, laughing at how one of them tripped a while ago. “Seriously, I haven’t been this fit since forever,” said the one who had tripped. “It’s been a month of doing nothing but resting, okay?”\nAs the adventurers continued their cheery conversation, the goblin who had disappeared in the trees was hiding very close nearby in a thicket.\nThe feet that she kept so stable suddenly collapsed, causing her body to brush through the thicket loudly.\nThe adventurers sighted the thicket and surrounded her, striking at the bushes and stabbing through her.\nShe cried help before she muttered some religious sayings. She didn’t know what to do, so she looked up only to find his eyes obstructed by the top of the thicket she was in. She couldn’t even see Heaven one more time before going there.\nShe dissipated into lifelessness, her body becoming a rolling pin underfoot.\nDelving into the adventurers’ viewpoint, they moved on and returned to Matthew, his presence a shadow in the distance looming over them and permanent like a floater on the surface of their eyes. He was like the clouds, ever-present yet overwhelmingly simple. Nothing stopped a god-like object from being an essential component of real life—like sun and night and daylight. It was nonetheless ultimate.\nShifting to Matthew’s perspective, he stood, staring and guessing a boat’s kinetic energy when shot incidentally.\nHe didn’t really need the answer, but it relaxed him to do so.\nNow that the fight was over, Matthew marshalled everyone and told them that any more training would be fruitless and even damaging. They had just started, so moving slowly was the key.\nThough, many of the adventurers actually had more energy, but they obeyed him nonetheless, trusting his judgement and monochromatically prioritizing harmony over disruption.\nLater, back at the inn at whih Matthew stayed last time, he lay down, trying to sleep, but ultimately unable to do so. He was not able to relax right now, but maybe, it was because the sight of the adventurers made him nervous.\nHe chose not to think about it too much and soon fell asleep.\nThe next day, at an area in the rainforest, Matthew stood, watching the same adventurers gathered. “What I need is a person who knows how to throw lightning. I need a spell like that. I want to test something…” One of them came up and showed small displays of her electic magic.\n“How did you do that?” Matthew said, referring to how she could use it in slight amounts.\n“My magic can be activated and deactivated,” said the lightning adventurer, Angeldefier Manabreaker. “When it’s activated, it actively eats at my mana, but that’s also when it creates sparks. It gets stronger the longer I use it, so that’s why I chose to have lots of mana.” Her middle name “Manabreaker” gave her a 15% increase in maximum mana, and her first name, though unrelated, increased all her damage against holy beings by 5%.\n“Interesting. Use that skill now at the water. I want to try something…”\n“It will work on the water, but the water is magic-resistant to my electricity as well.”\n“So does it work, or does it not work?”\n“It doesn’t, practically useless, absorbed completely by the water.”\n“Okay… then…” He just learned about the magic-resistant quality of water now. He realized something. “Does anyone have a water ability? And is it magic-resistant like the water?”\nOne adventurer raised his hand.\n“I want you to use that water to block attacks.”\n“I already do that,” said the adventurer.\n“Okay then. Just checking.” Despite his calm and rough tone, Matthew was panicking slightly inside from how much new information he was getting, his mind actively brainstorming in response to the new information as he spoke.\nMatthew inhaled deeply through his nose while raising his head; letting the adventurers freely interpret what that meant. He was too bothered to keep that pondering feeling inside him.\n“Okay, so… I’ve been thinking… We can try having each of you take various roles based on your certain skills.” It was vague, but it was a good start.\nThe adventurers were not doubtful whatsoever.\nMatthew immediately rushed to organize them, lodging them into various positions and telling them to cut down trees and position the logs around the area. His time as a beginner had inspired him to do this. It was also a good thing that he had let them take a break early yesterday.\nHe tested various formations and positions. ‘Now,” he said with a smile, “I need you all to dash and run to certain positons. Working with a more open environment often involves learning how to let enemies come to you where they are more at a disadvantage and you are more at an advantage. Do not force fights, and focus on keeping the enemy chasing, while you guys secure objectives and bait the enemy into coming in. So moving around and getting used to shifts in overall team composition by position and rotation will be your essential training moving forward.” He put down the metaphorical hammer, starting the training.\nThe adventurers ran, leaping over slopes and rushing past each other. The fight was a matter of coordination and team shape and internal fabric. If the fabric could stretch and become compressed without fully becoming incorrigible, then that was great. The goal was to make their team a sponge, a mat, cotton, or a stretchable lump of rubber, endlessly subsuming new ways to express and adapt to enemies with diverse skills and team compositions. The goal was to eliminate the degree in which their enemies obliterated their focus via often temporary visual and auditory disruptions that left individual members chaotic and “selfish” in their decision-making. The goal was to maintain fabric via muscle memory and overall automaticity.\nEventually, the training ended, resulting in Matthew’s confidence increasing and the team becoming much more construct and conceptually reified.\nThis was idealism at its core, turning ideas into things forethought to be impossible.\nHe grabbed the infinite fabric that made up his broader interconnected party of parties and let it create itself, only closing his eyes, and wherever his mind said to go, it went.\nAt a dungeon, meanwhile, several goblins found themselves turning around a corner. The simple moments were quiet and soothing, and nothing could break that.\nEventually, the entrance of the dungeon made way for the whole shadow of over a hundred adventurers.\nThe goblins saw the silence aroused to violent chaos, and their bodies were gripped by an almost spiritual necessity to depart.\nThe holy skin of Matthew came forth.\nHe commanded, his hands becoming like ethereal whispers in the dark, emerging again and again and reforming themselves each time in infinite succession.\nThe infinite fabric representing the adventurers glowed and continued to reform itself as well.\nGreat job defeating that armored goblin!

Soon enough, with his focus in total abandon, he created a spark—magic blooming from silence and disorientation. In this surreal moment, a feathery light was half revealed before it began to drip.\nThe magic bursted into existence in the manifestation of a few particles.\nIt was a tiny example of magic without skills, but it was good practice. The more in sync he was with his mana, the easier it was to cast his skills with ease. This way, the [System] could give him skills that required a higher level of mana-controlling prowess. But it didn’t necessarily make his journey any easier.\nAfterwards, he joined many other adventurers part of Matthew’s new 100-man party primarily assembled for training. But its defeat of the Great Spider Serpelvz made waves in the guild.\nShifting to another adventurer under Matthew, earlier, Braindisruptor Armorbreaker, a man in his forties, stood up, finding himself on a chair. It was like he was not even here.\nHe looked at the wall, and he saw the people on the street. But they looked to be wooden figures or puppets He didn’t feel like they were human at all.\nEverything felt dead around him.\nHe didn’t know what this feeling was, but he remembered similar feelings when he was a teenager.\nBut as an adult, he rarely felt the emotions of a teenager because he was much more stable, and things made more sense.\nHowever, now, he felt a sense of dissociation, and he recognized it.\nBut it wasn’t something he could describe.\nHe was here, but he also wasn’t here.\nHow long had he been here? It was like the memories from years ago was an illusion.\nHe walked around, and for some reason, his muscles felt like it was paper. His body was the most wooden out of all the figures he saw.\nHe knew what he was experiencing, but he didn’t know why.\nHe realized that the past week had been a very cold-hearted him.\nAnd it manifested as dissociation.\nBraindisruptor ran outside, finding his way to Matthew’s new party, having only joined it.\nSwitching to a third adventurer, some time ago, Shekinah, a woman in her twenties, stood next to a fellow adventurer, Luke, in front of a troll.\nThe troll stared between Shekinah and Luke, tears dripping down his face. “They killed my friends! My friends! You think I won’t do it? I’ll do it!” He held an artifact that would kill all creatures within 100 meters.\n“Hey!” said Luke.\nThe troll continued: “If I die, this’ll start a new war, one between you humanfolk and the trolls. You don’t want that, do you? Tensions already high ever since you guys began invading goblin territory!”\n“Stop now…”\nThe troll kept going: “And you all know what the recent nobles have said about the high trolls! They’re not happy about our recent purchases of goblin land, and they’ve began blocking off our routes! You know what that means! All they need is a trigger now. Trolls have always been violent creatures, but it’s only the last few centuries that we decided to be peaceful now. Now, tell me why I shouldn’t do this! My friends are gone! You guys killed them, and they got away with it! Tell me! I demand an answer! Where are those adventurers! All of us are responsible! You bred those adventurers and raised them! Those were your people!”\nShekinah had gotten herself involved in something she didn’t want to care about. “Why the hell is it our fault? Why take everything personal?”\n“Shekinah!” Luke warned.\n“They were my friends,” said the troll, “you dimwit!”\n“Right…” Shekinah covered her face with frustration. “But seriously, can you not? Be sensible and logical for once.”\n“Really! After what those adventurers did! You’re just going to look at your family and watch them die and do nothing about it, huh! You just laugh at them! Yeah, that’s what you do! You disgusting adventurers! Horrible creatures!”\nShekinah scoffed. “Says you. Just shut up. You know you’re wrong. There’s no reason to take it out on society just because you suck and you can’t deal with loss! If you thought straight, you would have asked us about those adventurers, and just maybe, we would find out who did it. But look at you!” She didn’t want to care about this conversation. She knew he was projecting her self-provocations at the troll, but honestly, if her life ended like this, she wouldn’t be mad.\nThe troll chose not to let Shekinah’s provocations get to him. “They just killed my friend. What am I supposed to do!”\n“When?”\n“Hours ago! They came here, and they did it in front of me…” His voice shook with grief.\nShekinah hated looking at emotion-driven behavior, and remembering her past instances of exhibiting it only intensified this aversion.\n“Fuck…” she said. “What can we do?”\n“I want those adventurers dead right now! I want the adventurers gone!”\n“Wait, wait, what do you mean!”\n“No more adventurers! They get away with anything! A bunch of disgusting lynchers!”\n“So you want a more centralized system? One where adventurers are much more regulated and new entrants are carefully selected by the state?” Shekinah knew where this was going.\n“That actually sounds like a good idea! Yeah, what you said!”\n“Seriously, though, why don’t we just let adventurers do what they want without acccountability or repercussions like a bunch of de facto police that terrorized marginalized races?” she said sarcastically. She was not on the adventurers or the troll’s side. She was just tired of politics and wanted nothing to do with it. She already knew the current political and systemic concept of adventurers was inherently unsustainable and revolved around loopholes, unenforceable laws, and de facto authority. Sooner or later, a revolution in response to the issues stemming from this concept would develop and overthrow the existing order. Magic only accelerated this process.\nThe troll eventually calmed down, giving Shekinah time to ponder.\nLong afterwards, Shekinah joined Matthew’s party as well.\nAccelerating to an wider level, each new member carrying their own experiences, Matthew’s party was growing in value: each member a coin drop to the overall value.\nSoon, at the assembly, Shekinah, Mindcrusher Manrender, and Braindisruptor Armorbreaker were present, despite their complex past and overall history.\nMatthew raised his hand, as a hundred adventurers moved, each bearing their own concerns and struggles. Sooner or later, he would muster their everything.\nThe journey was rough.\nThey reached a dungeon, but they first set up camp as was natural. During this time, the many adventurers came into contact, conversing and networking with each other, all from different parties.\nMatthew saw Mindcrusher, Braindisruptor, and Shekinah, acknowledging their presence, humanity, and potential. He knew that everyone deserved a second chance, because he too knew what it was like to suffer.\nHe disappeared into the role of divine seating.\nThe throne of heavenly places was his rightful place.\nMindcrusher approached him, and for the first time, Matthew was asked about his methods.\nMatthew imagined himself leaping out after his throne crumbled, shouting before falling down to a pitiable doom, “I deserve this! Give it to me!”\nHe knew how weak he was. But he had to get into the role.\nRaising his arms like he was holding a flag, he stood up and said that it depended on context and situation. “Often times,” he said, “strategies and tactics were situational. The details were almost always situational. Any technique or skill or usage of any output-giving thing resulted in a need for an adapatable approach. Sometimes, relying on the same methods did work, but it was more due to a matter of methodology and the right leaders ensuring that this methodology worked sustainably and consistently through other less obvious aspects concerning it. All in all, it depends.”\nHe wore his purple and yellow clothes, standing with a smirk. The greatness pouring out of his lungs, he stood, the angelic songs of heaven tunneling vastly around this place, his soul cracking, then glowing, and then revealing a magnificent creature. This creature was his heart.\nHis heart would be the ember crashing everything down.\nHe gritted his teeth.\nNothing got in his way.\nThe adventurers stood before him, looking outward.\nMatthew walked as if he was a baby imp crawling on four legs. This humble disposition only magnified the greatness that he could barely hide.\nThe crawling violent creature emerged within him, and he knew that with everything, to entertain and catch others’ attention was to live.\nSoon, this monstrosity reverted back to his human form. It was all metaphorical, but it demonstrated that nothing ever lasted, including his disguise. If he needed to express humility, he would. If anger, anger. If rage, rage. If heavenly grandiosity, then heavenly grandiosity.\nHe would not be hindered.\nThe dungeon in front of him hummed, as monsters crawled out of the depths.\nHe knew them by heart, waving his hand and pouring his commands and decrees like a king playing a board game on a map and transmitting real-time decisions.\nThe monsters called out before retreating to the darkness.\nThey hadn’t even entered the dungeon yet, but they had defended their position from the camp.\nMatthew couldn’t stop now, but his hands were shaking.\nHe didn’t actually know a lot about this world even now.\nHis strategy was systematic, but it didn’t harness all the details of this world. So he felt that he was very close to encountering an enemy that would apply the same turn-the-boat-into-a-torpedo strategy to him, basically ruining all sort of sense applicable on Earth with some rule-breaking skill or succession of strategies.\nThe closer he got to success, the more he found himself needing to take deep breaths.\nHe was this close.\nHe said before coming to the assembly earlier: “Please…\n“Don’t kill me now.”\nReturning to the present, he remembered the dragon he had seen back during the war against Mawkery, deciding that it was advisable to leave the area because he got a bad omen.\nAfter the assembly dispersed, Matthew returned to the inn to relax, worried that the dragon was indeed coming to get him after all the successes he had experienced so far. He fantasized about hiding as an immortal, hermit in the very vast isolated wilderness until he became someone completely different.\nThe good thing about having the assembly disperse then was that it was advisable to wait until his performance anxiety subsided.\nOnce he made that conclusion, he returned to calm.\n[Calm Walker]: All calming and mindfulness effects on you is increased by 10%!\nChapter 52 - The Communion of Witchman linkThe next day, Matthew found himself wandering in front of a cave entrance alone. He wanted to get his skills back by completing the [System] quest. Sure, he could get new skills, but after visiting Sophia earlier, he needed stability and a sense of continuity. So he wanted them back out of a desire to restore what had been.\nBut it was also true that he used to have strong skills.\nThe quest demanded that he killed the troll.\nObjective: Embark on a perilous journey into the depths of the dungeon to reclaim your lost levels and skills by defeating the formidable troll that dwells within.\nThe text returned to the word “dungeon” after it changed to “rainforest.” It did provide him with real-time status of the dungeon’s general location.\nBut he didn’t know which dungeon.\nThe rest of the text in the quest notification didn’t help much. It did tell him to hire sages or scholars, so since he wasn’t in a hurry to get his quests just yet, he decided to visit a familiar group of six adventurers that he wasn’t able to invite to the previous coalition.\nLater, waiting for the six adventurers, he stood on a large flat stretch of urban land, gazing at the plenteous roads and buildings all around.\nLooking at this, he was overwhelmed with the idea that he would never be able to comprehend any of this. He would never know what it was like to live here, and even if he did, he would miss out on a lot that happened while he focused on his personal goals and concerns.\nThe world was a vast place, yet it felt so small and lonely sometimes. But that was only because he stayed too much inside the guild and the dungeon. When he was at the forest, it was always for a singular reason, never giving himself time to explore for the sake of exploring and not for some other primary reason.\nThis feeling, world, and logic were of a plentiful, abundant, copious, ample, profuse, rich, lavish, liberal, generous, bountiful, large, huge, great, bumper, flush, overflowing, superabundant, infinite, inexhaustible, opulent, prolific, teeming, and bounteous nature galore.\nHe would never find that meaning.\nTen million memories shifted through his mind, and every sensation came alive in his bones, soul, heart, and spirit.\nHow many lives had he lived?\nHe funnelled all of it into his hands.\nToday, he would move on with this specific route, approach, strategy, plan, life, direction, movement, storm, happy place, environment, place, area, game, and fun place to be.\nHaving spent so much time living life to the fullest, the synonyms each brought up a unique branch of memories for him.\nAfter meeting the adventurers, he began a conversation.\nMaybe, in these silent movements, his life (past experiences) would become manifest.\nThe villain Witchman made his appearance, clinking tea with his contemporaries and forging alliances in order to rule the world.\nThe six adventurers, having waited for him at the wrong place, smirked, devilish brows and expressions sharpening like fierce lions striking against the earth.\nThe powers that were showed themselves here.\nAnd many would be affected by this communion.\nWitchman would soon raise an army for himself, directly transforming the 100-man party to his own private force, using up the gold coins earned from the quests to pay for his members.\nReturning to the moment, in the distance, two siblings were laughing next to a tall summoned male muscular demon with a skull head.\nWitchman saw that, even after seeing all kinds of strange and unique people throughout his time here.\nFor one, in the distance, a man walked next to a levitating fish-like creature holding something that resembled a balloon. The man wore a muted-green cloak. This cloak had a diamond-shaped hood with a blue line from across its center from the front edge of the top to the back edge. Moreover, he wore a red pouch resting against his left waist with the strap on his right shoulder. He also wore a white shirt inside and short trousers. His hair was spiky and pointed toward the front.\nThis was one example of how unique each individual was.\nThis extended to those three adventurer-bandits he killed before.\nBefore their deaths, they were each a human being in his own right.\nThe first was tall and handsome, with a strong jawline and piercing blue eyes. He had long, dark hair that fell down his back in waves. He was wearing a black coat over a white shirt, and black trousers. He had a gold chain around his neck, and a gold belt around his waist. He was also wearing a pair of black boots. He had large, orange wings that were spread out behind him. He was standing in front of a stained glass window, and there were flowers and smoke around him.\nThe second was a young man who was often seen sitting perched on a stone ledge, his posture relaxed yet alert. His fiery red hair, windblown and wild, framed a face of delicate features and a thoughtful expression. His eyes, a deep blue, were cast downwards, as if lost in contemplation. He was dressed in a vibrant blue jacket adorned with intricate gold embroidery, the open collar revealing a hint of his chest. His trousers, of the same rich blue, were tucked into sturdy leather boots that reached his mid-calf. A crimson sash was tied around his waist, adding a touch of regality to his attire. Resting beside him, its feathers a vibrant echo of his hair, was a majestic phoenix. The bird’s presence exuded an air of power and serenity, mirroring the young man’s own quiet strength.\nThe third was tall and slender, with long, flowing brown hair and a handsome face. He wore a grey doublet with gold embroidery and a red sash. His pants were black and his boots were brown. He was juggling a white ball in his right hand and had his left hand outstretched. He would often be found standing in front of a swirling orange and yellow background, with red berries growing on trees on either side of him. The ground beneath his feet was a dark, swirling mass.\nWitchman closed his eyes.\nHe made the three adventurer-bandits meaningless before his eyes again, rendering them formless and uninterpretable.\nHe would do it again and again, a mix of blue and green with a touch of gray shining from his lips and into the ethereality.\nHe broke the whip that kept his presence hindered, flowing through and through.\nHis words represented this ethereal dance, and soon, the six adventurers hearkened unto him, bemused at how magnificent his splendor was—a self-affirming loop geared toward apotheosis.\nWhen he opened his heart, he began raising his hands, and the skill [Phantom Shield] emerged, embracing his skin and blocking the damage. This was representatational, and soon enough, symbolically, the hands of the adventurers and Witchman were declared to remain clasped unto great new deeds.\nMatthew became Witchman, and Witchman became Matthew.\nHe walked toward the horizon, as a host of men and women clanged alongside behind him.\nThe champion of glory and hope was His Name.\nHe Became A Crucial Element of Life and Death. He Was The Savior of Them All.\nHe embraced the earth, and all its peoples became his slaves.\nWitchman opened his eyes.\nThe coffee cups clinked together, breaking his imagination. It was grandiose and full of splendor, but it was only his in his mind.\nThe people around him were grounded and full of the elements of humanity, the earth, and even the sea as they drank liquids and ate the juice of fruits. This was the ocean making its way to their hearts.\nIn the end, Matthew was all alone.\nHis thoughts marred him as him.\nHe agreed with the six adventures, and they soon ended their discussion.\nIt would involve staging an attack at a dungeon—a typical day.\nMatthew looked around him, wishing for splendor for the third time, but he found nothing except the sombering dirt.\nHe took a deep breath and moved on.\n[Calm Walker]: All calming and mindfulness effects on you is increased by 10%!\nHowever mundane his world was, his ideals would eventually penetrate the hexagonal barrier fabric sphere of magic, control, power, and longer society.\nHis eyes grossly widened, he disappeared into the masses, a pop of energy representing his existence among an eternity of people.\nThe beats of the drums would sound.\nHe would not lay down in silence.\nHe would not keep his mouth shut.\nHe would not laugh when the bough broke.\nHe would be present, tending to it and using it as a stepping stone to greater heights even.\nHe whirled inwardly in reverses, upside-down motions, and inversions and then outwardly. He became an amorphous creature.\nThe loudest scream was in cursive.\nAt the dungeon, Matthew stared at several goblins.\nConversing with them, he asked whether they participated in training or any kind of sports like tournaments. When he heard a yes to both, he smiled, laughing, saying: “That’s good. You guys want to try…?” He was referring to what he mentioned earlier.\n“But are we even allowed there really?” said one of the goblins.\n“Slaves are allowed, so you guys are allowed, but you won’t be slaves, don’t worry.”\nMatthew managed to make friends with several goblins after he did the one thing no other adventurer did—he communicated.\nBut he was still well-known as a murderer. The good thing was that Witchman was not Matthew. Matthew separated himself mentally from that person. Witchman was just a construct, and he could easily deconstruct it like he had disbanded the last coalition. This Witchman thing was not real, and it didn’t have to impinge upon the more pressing needs of uniting goblins and humans, even in small steps overtime.\nThe goblins then came under his wing, and Matthew sponsored them to fight in a tournament. He had never gone to a tournament, so this was his first.\nThe zooming sounds of battle flowed through the air, as if smacking all the raised cheering hands in the tournament dome.\nThe goblins were only watching for now, but soon, it would be their turn.\nIt was expected for them to wait eight days, so Matthew was careful to stay alert because he couldn’t rest until these goblins got their chance.\nSoon enough, with Matthew keeping himself appropriately distant yet present and listening, the goblins found a protector in him.\n8 days later, Matthew stared, his eyes dark with exhaustion and an overwhelming sense of disorientation. He spent all these time making sure that the goblins were allowed inside, contacting many friends and trying to get into contact with people relevant to this objective. It took 8 days since it was something new to him. Even with a network of his own, it was still localized within a tiny adventurer sphere.\nThe goblins walked their first steps in the arena, preparing their swords. They were not Tamer’s trained goblins, but Matthew did make sure to instruct them about some strategy. Though, he knew he didn’t spent much time at all instructing them and felt that they had so much room to imporve.\nThe goblins lost immediately.\nBut Matthew was patient, influencing them as well to compose themselves.\nAfter all, Matthew needed trusted goblins to hunt down the troll.\nThe goblins laughed and smiled.\nNumbers added to the count.\nWhen viewed from a more rational lens, monitoring the goblins’s wellbeing and perfomance synchronously promoted an approach of linear growth, assuming an optimal vacuum. However, he didn’t need to boost their wellbeing and performance when it came to the tournament maximally. The help he could give was little, but it was little enough that he wasn’t spending too much time on it, but enough that the goblins would improve slightly and find confidence in him as a result. In the end, his objective was to have the goblins help him hunt down the troll to retrieve his levels and skills, and that could mean that minimal effort to help them on his part was sufficient. Of course, the more information, the better, but expending energy into monitoring the goblins’ sublter aspects might be unoptimal when taking into account his broader responsibilities and priorities. A systematic approach might find incorporating fine, precise injections of confidence-building at the goblins informally and incidentally rather than as a main methodological focus moving forward to yield a pronounced rate of responsiveness than if approached with more formal intentions—in favor of a bottom-up style as opposed to a top-down one.\nVignettes of focused thought emerged preferentially after a sequence of rounds monopolized by vividness, entrenched action, and internal asynchrony. This was not special whatsoever, and it was a natural response to his ever-changing personhood and to common dynamics characterizing multiple dimensions of experience, marked by interplays of social, cultural, geographical, and physical factors.\nHe slowed down, appreciating the butterly passing by him.\nAs a consequence of the depth in which his systematization surveyed, his brain needed a break, so he cheered at the goblins before him, wishing them good luck.\nThe goblins had their confidence boosted.\nA simple sign of support was all they needed. Even with lives so simply defined, they still made waves upon waves in the world. They just needed a chance, or one shot, or one opportunity.\nAnd Matthew was that hand stretching into the darkness from the light.\nChapter 53 - The Thralls of Justice: Matthew’s Controversial Decision linkHowever, soon enough, Matthew decided to have the goblins join him on a quest. He introduced them as slaves, explaining that he would merely use them. As for why he did this, a burning sense of curiosity that had started since the death of Sophia and his exploration of the city of Power, the second city that he encountered in this world, among every other experience. This was a breaking point for him, and one that manifested in a desire to help and to create life out of the darkness. Expanding our perspective, it had been exactly six months and 15 days since he first came to this world—a long and intense enough span of time to signal an opportunity to shift his strategy. In the end, if the goblins could become the instrument through which he could release all those building emotions inside, then that would be justice in itself.\nHis questionable methods could be compared to a man forcing himself to take up a new hobby, such as going to the gym, after his former girlfriend had just broken up with him.\nEven if he had been tortured about goblins and entertained his aversion toward adventuring and the moral quandaries thereof, sometimes the toxic relationship (or a codependent one or a dysfunctional family) was just too sweet, and he had no one else to turn to. To explain this sense of loneliness, everyone he knew only supported him as an adventurer and not as the human being that conflicted with this role and identity. Ultimately, aiding the goblins and transforming them into reusable items offered a thrilling alternative to adventuring, even if it was altogether risky.\nThe problem about people like Matthew was they were rationally irrational, internally logical but when viewed in the real world, they were out of touch. In minds like these, even contradictory elements were harmonious. But that was just about everyone, because even the most contradictory of things could find a silver lining in which they bloomed in concert. His emotions were present, yet he knew to hide it. His logic was present, yet his jet lag (changing sleep schedules and disrupting his circadian rhythms to be present at quests and events) had gotten to him many times. The mystical and fortunate thing was that Matthew had improved far beyond any average human back on Earth, and people saw that level of awesomeness. If they knew his internal struggles that denoted his humanity, they might found it challenging to appreciate his greatness. That was why he hid it like many other leaders in power, because his reputation and the abstract symbol of an unrealistic idealized male adventurer mattered more instead. It was fantastical that he had even improved so much since day 1, but the struggles that he suppressed psychologically, if revealed, would invalidate his above-average contributions.\nPeople wanted change or the maintenance of nostalgic ideals that had never existed except in the mind. He would answer them and convince the world that he was special when he was not.\nHe would become the epitome of grace and beauty when he was just a regular man.\nHe would become Aba-Oh-Rah.\nReturning closer to reality, earlier, before he introduced the goblins as slaves for a quest, at the tournament, one of the goblins struck gold when he struck one of them on the neck. It was a simple stab, but his opponent was already twirling on the ground like a bunch of snakes strewn and sewn together.\nAfter this opponent lost his life, the goblins kept a loose wedge formation, as ordered by Matthew. To elucidate upon this, it was only one method. However, the looseness allowed them to mitigate the damage from area-of-effect skills, while the wedge aspect allowed them to keep a sharp point and mobility in the event of a suddenly vulnerable opponent. Moreover, by the use of natural obstacles and terrain contours, this formation naturally created chokepoints, funnelled opponents into awkward positions, and provided cover for its members, especially at the rear, in comparison to the more linear, man-on-man face-off provided by a line formation. This was why their wedge consisted of two layers with a front line and a back line similar to two chevrons stacked together. Regarding the terrain use, the good thing was that the arena was set in the middle of a forest-like area with sparse trees available enough to be relevant but few enough for the audience to watch with ease. To sum, this loose wedge formation was better than staying tight together or in a line formation where it was much easier to hit them from ranged area-of-effect attacks.\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, with this formation, they charged at opponents that became suddenly vulnerable. During this time, they temporarily crowded together, surrounded the opponent, neutralized them, and then reverted to their formation.\nBut sometimes, a linear approach was necessary to help them hide while maintaining vision over opponents. Moving in a line was also helpful, but they rarely implemented it in the arena since its size was limited. However, it was much bigger than what Matthew knew arenas to be, because the members equipped a binocular-like tool that allowed them to see farther. This tool was relevant in previous quests and combat.\nFor each kill the goblins got, they got a notification distinct from what Matthew received.\n+76 XP 1+ skill point (Lvl. 9 Gladiator)\n+103 XP 1+ skill point (Lvl. 15 Gladiator)\nAll of them levelled up to level 2 because the XP was shared between them.\nOne of the goblins checked his status page.\nName: Render\nSpecies: Goblin\nAge: 6\nSkills: Red Bite\nSpells: None / None\nVitality: 8\nWhen it came to Matthew’s perspective, he pondered about a pattern he had noticed for a long time now, but he never truly felt sure. Regular adult goblins only gave 7 XP on kill, and armored goblins gave 42 XP. It was a 600% increase when they were armoed. So regular adult humans probably gave around 30 XP, and if armored, they possibly gave 180 XP. As for levels, most of the goblins he had killed were only level 1, and it was probably because they often died immediately before killing enough creatures to level up. When it came to the number of XP levels added to the result, he guessed that it added 10 XP per level. However, he couldn’t truly be sure since he had never killed enemies that varied in level to test. Moreover, he hadn’t killed enough humans to see what adventurers and gladiators gave. He also wondered whether the class of an adventurer mattered or existed. The [System] never addressed it, so he didn’t ever ask about it.\nSpeaking of classes, he remembered the tanner from City of Power and decided that he would visit him a month from now.\nContinuing this line of thought, he had a list of names that he wanted to visit in person, having listed them down in bullet points: Sophia, Drakekiller Rollingthunder, Tanner, Tamer Languiosse, Thorne, Elara, Lumi, Desmond Leroy, Jayce, Richard, Kairo, Nova, Ella, Prism, Ada, Echo, Elena, Liam, Finesse (goblin), Deathbringer (Ray), Brandon (Redspiller Warmaker), Brackern (Suneater Herculeanridder), Michel (Doomsinger Mighttaker), the people at the homeless shelter, Zephyrine Quill, Thaddeus Pumpernickel, Seraphina Wisteria, Mortimer Quixote, Calliope Snickerdoodle, Bartholomew Wombatish, Rodney Callous, Bishop Dan, Drakekiller Rollingthunder (duplicate entry), Johun (priest), Herblord, Abyssalfurnace, Zoey, Basewars, Finnegan “Finn” Swiftwater, Isadora “Izzy” Wildwood, Declan “Dex” Stoneheart, Lila “Lark” Moonshadow, Elias “Eli” Sunfire, Angeldefier Manabreaker, Mindcrusher Manrender, the troll, Mawkery, Mark Reader, Grimtusk.\nAs for those he had reunited with in the last coalition, he wasn’t really able to catch up, so he wanted to talk to them one-on-one and ask how they were doing similar to what he did with the six adventurers. Though, even his discussion with them was more serious and concerned a future dungeon visit instead of an intimate conversation between friends.\nAs for Finesse and Sophia, both of whom had passed, he wanted to visit their graves. He had been visiting Finesse’ grave since it was right in front of his cottage, but he felt like keeping his name in his list as a reminder. As for who Finesse was, he was the goblin he had signed a contract with.\nConcerning Grimtusk and the troll, his goal was to beat them eventually.\nNow that Matthew had laid out and addressed many concerns weighing on his mind, he focused his attention on the goblins.\nThey soon lost, but fortunately, they were not killed because they killed at least two other as a team. To clarify, the tournament preferred team-based combat.\nNow that Matthew had prepared the goblins, he returned to his 100-man party, bringing the 15 goblins in and explaining their status as thralls. He even made them engage in back-breaking labor to demonstrate.\nQuickly, the adventurers pretended to accept it and moved on.\nThe goblins also relished the opportunity like a bunch of new poor, possibly recently emigrated, marginalized workers moving awkwardly in the background of a bunch of potbellied wealthy mouth-stuffers—an uncommon but distinct sight back on Earth. The awkwardness displayed by these goblins due to their unfamiliarity with human and adventurer culture contributed to this idea that they were dirty, unrefined, ugly, disgusting, unbearable, lazy, stupid, and dangerous—uncommon but distinct derogatory terms used to describe street kids by those attending expensive colleges. Classism and racism were alive and breathing even here. And hiding them was a trait of the out-of-touch.\nHowever, Matthew was trying his best to even the playing ground while still not demanding too much from the adventurers to empathize with the goblins. He was also a hypocrite, but he had to do his best today. It was better than giving up on a human being, or a humanoid in this case.\nHe understood what he was doing was relatively extreme. Speaking of egalitarian values often involved “inequality” among already wealthy and powerful humans and not between the rich and the poor and between humans and goblins. It was the selective nature of the values touted by human intellectuals.\nThe thing was that it was not Matthew’s fault. He didn’t care about or want their politics. But he knew he had to care about their strong views if he wanted to work with them.\nHe hated politics.\nHonestly, he wanted to just murder these adventurers and these goblins altogether. He was so tired of their pettiness, between full-fledged adults nonetheless. It was tiresome and infuriating.\nIf he could grab an explosive artifact and burn this city down along with its putrid stains that never went away, that would be splendid.\nHe hated this essence of Disgust.\nBut he had to be the patient, polite, and objective person, being the symbol of heavenly places and the divine deserving destiny of adventurerdom. It was stupid, but it was how easily influenced people were that he had to engage in this out-of-touch grandiose behavior. Even killing thousands would not be enough for them. He needed to kill millions on the first day before they wouldn’t call him unintelligent, as if intelligence was dictated by the ability to destroy.\nIn the end, he was taking care of a bunch of babies who suckled ideals that would never come true, striving so arrogantly and abandoning human beings in the process.\nThat was his reality.\nHe had to face it, even if he had been ignoring these political and social aspects all this time.\nSo he decided that the best thing to do now was to bring down the pinnacle of superiority. No one would blame him for doing this act.\nThis pinnacle could be anything.\nAnd no one would blame him as long as he expressed his great destiny.\nHe went to a dungeon along with the 6 adventurers, his 100-man party, and the 15 goblins.\nTime was ticking.\nHe would enslave this civilization.\nHe had to help someone. He had to do something this time. He couldn’t just sit still and watch his brothers suffer.\nBut he was just playing the showman, right?\nChapter 54 - Laughing at the Face of Death linkMatthew laughed at the face of death, because he himself got tired of living.\nHe struck hundreds of mad goblins and charged across them, imitating Zoey’s way of fighting.\nHe laughed genuinely when one of the giant ants tripped, the thrill bursting through the seams.\nThe adventurers charged in multiple lines, while Matthew drew a children’s drawing with his hand imagitively. He created a mental map of the dynamic environment, adapting to the changes with a childish grin on his face.\nHe was like a child again, curiously exploring a vast world of newness and novel things. He loved exploration and learning.\nThe boat skill flew at his side, lighting bursted from one of the mages, water blocked magical attacks from the enemy, goblins adopted a wedge formation, the six adventurers unleashed their skill combos, and he kept a line of communication weaving it all together.\nHe laughed at the face of death, guffawing.\nThe pummelling power his army exerted was beautiful like a bunch of toy blocks arranging together on the tilted floor of his former family apartment home. He missed the feeling of fun for the first time.\nHe danced and sang.\nThe sky rewarded him with levels and swathes of XP across the adventurerhood making up his group.\nHe loved them, and he had fun!\nHe loved the sounds of heaven, and it was all around him.\nHe grabbed a dead giant ant’s leg, and he bit it.\nHe bit and bit, chewing it and trying to swallow it.\nThe inside of his mouth bled.\nHe healed himself.\nIt tasted so good.\nAll the while, he fulfilled his role as a commander.\nHis eccentricities didn’t go unnoticed, as the adventurers had begun calling him endearing nicknames among themselves. This denoted something more awe-inspiring than a simple nickname. It pointed to their disciplined and coordinated rallying under someone whose quirks and astounding strength and wisdom painted him as a larger-than-life figure.\nCoincidentally, in the ongoing dungeon fight, Deathbringer made a surprise appearance orchestrated by Matthew, jovially bringing his own new party.\nHe made his own slice of pie in the fight.\nAnyway, when Matthew ate the ant leg earlier, he didn’t notice it, but he gained a new passive skill: [XP Gain Upon Eating Ant Legs].\nBasically, he gained 10 XP each time he ate an ant leg.\nSo he began eating all the giant ant legs, cleaning them all up.\nIt was a simple, fun away for him to do something that felt good and tasted good.\n+10 XP (Eating Giant Ant Leg)\nHe noticed something strange about this notification. The more he spent time with the goblins, the more his notifications began emulating theirs.\nEven his kill notifications earlier had the same format.\n+90 XP (Lvl. 1 Giant Ant)\nThe songs of grace had blessed his awakening and presence.\nNow, the giant ants came in waves before him.\nBut he was free to dance in the wind.\nThe skill blasts of the ants were blocked by large barriers of magic shaped like a curvilinear square attached to them above the adventurer mages’ heads.\nThe giant ant that had turned huge magically stood up and raised her hands, crushing rocks before using the kinetic energy to blast waves of light.\nThe adventurer formations were stunned, but Matthew stood up and led the way, smoothing out the coalescing and shifts in this concentric attack around the huge ant.\nSoon enough, the huge ant stumbled, making a whirring sound like a giant crane, before falling sideways to the ground. The large impact made waves of dust that troubled adventurers who had allergies.\nThe aftermath left the adventurers in a state of disarray, but they were prepared, immediately bringing out the containers and the vast amounts of preparations and resources they moved to the entrance of this dungeon chamber of epic proportions before the fight started.\nMatthew had been part of that setting up process and was now part of the active carrying out of the party’s primary strategies. The secondary strategies were spearheaded by people like Mindcrusher, Braindisruptor, and Shekinah.\nIn the end, this dungeon chamber was now under their control, offering a new mana mine for the city. The monster farm that could be made from it would take very long to set up, so that was outside short-term considerations and even many long-term perspectives. It was for those who expressed years in decades or centuries even.\nLater, Matthew fell to the floor next to his cottage mat bed, having tired himself out. He had to keep hiding this side of him, but it wasn’t as if his fellow adventurers didn’t know what he was like at all. Ever since he lost his levels and skills, they knew.\nThey knew it wasn’t easy for him to reach this far in life, because it came at the cost of his own sanity sometimes.\nBut he was glad that he did his best today.\nThese negative emotions were only temporary because he was sleepy.\nHe soon fell asleep, his body lying on the floor, breathing without pause, still damp from his profuse sweating earlier. It was so hot in this climate, but it also rained a lot. It was the tropical rainforest climate where it never snowed.\nElsewhere, a shadow watched him. It was the [System]. He still wanted Matthew to grow further, so that was why he kept an eye on him.\nThe gods that had given Matthew 12,000 XP were still there, and the [System] naturally took that into account when judging his next actions in regard to Matthew.\nMatthew had planned to relax tomorrow, visit some friends, and maybe even do simple quests.\nThe next day, he sat up, finding his mat so hot. He got up and looked outside. It was yellow and intense like being on Mars.\nHe walked outside and found that he didn’t want to do so.\nHe wasn’t invulnerable, so he would rather just be lazy for a little while longer. He lacked sleep.\nThis was the case usually.\nHe went outside, weirded out by the trees, even if he had seen them so many times before.\nAnyway, his day of rest began.\nTo start, he sat still in his cottage, playing a small game with his things. He played for the duration of his waking time, which was 9 hours past the normal waking hours, but he also played hours past my waking time. He stayed up for past 9 hours probably.\nSo last week, Deathbringer asked Matthew if he wanted to go with him to the villagers, and Matthew said yes. Deathbringer told Matthew this during his trip and that of Matthew, his cousin, and his father to Manban where they visited a new coffee shop with a gorgeous vantage point in the direction of a volcano and went to a forest called “Westbrook.” To be more clear, this was “Westbrook Forest” in “South Falsey” in Redmint, Sundula near Manban. However, when the day came for them to travel, which was rescheduled due to strong rain that led to the river which they would have to pass to get to the villagers becoming too high for us to pass, Deathbringer forgot to bring Matthew. While Deathbringer, his cousin, and his father were traveling by wagon probably 5 to 10 minutes away from the city, they remembered and went back to get Matthew. So he got wind of this while he was still in his cottage, having finished a game round. He asked Deathbringer if they were leaving already, and Deathbringer said that he wanted to eat first. So in the meantime, he lay down, and he ended up falling asleep. One of Deathbringer’s party members tried to wake him up, but Matthew told him that Deathbringer was still eating. After Matthew fell asleep again, Deathbringer’s cousin woke him up, and by that time, Deathbringer and Deathbringer’s father “Lyko” were there at the way station. So Matthew went with Deathbringer’s cousin, only bringing himself only with my adventurer clothes without any artifacts. He rode at the front passenger seat of the wagon, and he noticed the bags filling up the back passenger seat. So once they reached the way station where Deathbringer was, Matthew and the cousin brought down the bags one by one and had them sit a short distance away from the door of the carriage. So after some communication with the carriage guard, they got him to open up the magical chest of the carriage where people placed items that would be hard or impossible bringing onto the carriage itself. Indeed, in Matthew’s case, since their bags and wrapped books were many and heavy, it was much more convenient that they placed them in the chest on the side of the carriage. So after saying goodbye to Deathbringer’s cousin, Matthew, Deathbringer, and his father went inside the carriage and sat down at the very back, bringing in boxes that they leaned against the top of the seats at the very back and the back wall of the carriage itself.\nShifting to their time at the carriage, they were greeted with a diverse line-up of people over the long hour they waited there for the carriage to accumulate passengers since it was the last round of that bus for the night. Once the carriage was full, he saw a chubby woman on the right side of the bus from his vantage point right subsequent to us in terms of seating arrangement. Basically, she was seated second to last, as they were seated at the very back at the last seat section. So viewing it forward from their vantage point put her subsequent to us in the domain of order. Transitioning to this particular view with them as the first row that encompassed both left and right seating columns, he saw a group of youth on the fourth row to their left, and they sat next to Deathbringer on the second row to their left. Deathbringer asked him to move the box to his left away from the man coming into the carriage along the way and onto the stack of boxes on Deathbringer’s lap. Lyko, the family friend, sat on the window seat to Matthew’s right, while he sat around the middle of the two-column seat section. Deathbringer sat between Lyko and Matthew. During their time waiting for passengers to accumulate and during the time the bus was already moving, he struck a conversation with Deathbringer with regard to his adventuring and learning experience. This conversation turned into a long discussion that led to his time there seeming the most sophisticated out of all of the interactions that did happen inside the carriage. It was the kind of discussion one would have at a seminar. In addition to this point, it made his time there easier and more relaxing enough that he was able to relax. Though, when a couple of passengers entered and sat down next to him on his left, leaving hin little room to stretch and move on my seat, he began to feel a little uncomfortable. However, this was temporary, and soon enough, Matthew’s group moved to the second or third row to my left.\nMoving on to our time outside the carriage at Salas when they were heading to the actual port building itself, this was the most sudden aspect of our travel. When they exited the carriage, the bags and books were brought onto a wagon, and this allowed him to observe around and note in his head regarding the gravel on the ground, which he would continue to note and observe later. Lyko rode this wagon, while Matthew and Deathbringer walked around. Deathbringer pushed along a cart and carried the boxes we brought on it, while Matthew only walked alongside. Once they were closer to the port building at the end of the wagon’s destination, the wagon driver helped them move their items further inside past a checkpoint with signs that communicated with respect to what wasn’t allowed to bring to the ship such as artifacts and pork. After placing their bags on the side under this group of signs, they then moved them one by one inside the port building itself with the passing attention of the guards and soldiers stationed there and the help of one adventurer guard. After they went inside, Deathbringer joined a long waiting line for a particular enterprise’s ships, and Matthew noticed that this was the longest waiting line besides another line that was similarly long. Though, these two lines were the only ones that were noticeably long. After they got their ticket, they waited on the many seats of the large building, and he was able to eat both pork adobo and ampalaya from one of the stalls there. As for one of the many passing interactions of Deathbringer, he communicated with one or two vendors about a certain older woman who used to be a vendor here at the place; though, even after repeated clarification, the vendors claimed that they didn’t know who that person was. Walking around left Matthew conspicuous enough that people glanced at him for longer than usual, as he was the only one wearing adventurer clothes and carrying nothing else for the most part. He did help carry the bags from under the signs to the port building, but this was a relatively short distance in comparison to what was coming later.\nDuring their wait for the ship to come and the time for passengers to enter came, they stayed for two hours or so and used their time to eat, lie down and rest, change seating, stand around, and use the latrines there, among others. In addition, Deathbringer relocated items among their bags to make them more concise for carrying.\nOnce the time came for passengers to board the ship, they went outside the port building and had to walk a very long way to the ship. During this time, they carried bags one by one, because according to Lyko, they didn’t know about the shuttle that could have brought the bags for them instead. This was the most difficult part of the journey, as one of the bags was very heavy. The worst part was that this was the first bag that he carried in that series of carrying to the ramp of the ship.\nProgressing to a more visceral level, he was in so much pain when he carried this first bag that he began thinking philosophically while carrying. Moreover, he never put down this bag for what felt like the duration of 15 minutes of carrying this heavy bag after months of an exhaustingly active lifestyle. It was so painful that it would be the most distinct memory of the trip.\nReturning to the ramp of the ship, it was here that the ship staff brought it to one side inside the ship where the vehicles parked. The smiles and interest of the staff as Matthew carried the bags one by one gave a sense of ease and humor despite the difficulty of exerting a great deal of effort after months of pushing himself physically.\nAfter carrying many bags and even jogging and sprinting to get the rest of the bags toward the end of our series of carrying bags, they finally entered the ship, being the last passengers to board. However, during this series, they did pass many checkpoints on the way, getting the attention of stationed guards and passing staff. Namely, one passing ship staff even helped me find one ball toy that dropped from a bag midway to the ship.\nOnce they were inside, they were more relaxed and confident despite being very sweaty. The people noticed them in light of the fact that they were the last ones to board. But Matthew’s conspicuous positive and confident mood looked unusual in a plethora of people mentally prepared to wait for the ship to reach its destination in some discomfort. However, he brought my optimism and sense of relief in a strong way, having long casual conversations with Deathbringer with regard to many things. During this extended interaction, they caught the attention of nearby passengers, considering that he spoke in what sounded like adventurer English or wealthy cityfolk English, especially here in this region. It wasn’t really English, but since it was the language Matthew knew how to speak by default, he just called it English for convenience’s sake. Anyway, he was very confident that he took on whatever pose he wanted in order to feel comfortable, and he was standing by the side of the ship, looking at the sea water. He wasn’t afraid to sit on my haunches or squat down, and he wasn’t afraid to be honest about growing up and playing outdoor children’s games like langit lupa as a child. He wasn’t afraid to talk about more personal things, and that imagery of confidence likely became imprinted as part of a broader understanding into his personality accessible for use by Deathbringer and Lyko.\nAnyway, after the trip ended, Matthew was able to rest his mind and regain his sanity. At the villages, he learned that magically vaccinating them from tropical diseases such as dengue was a regular procedure. Also, he discovered that it was not going to be easy to start a farm, considering that he needed farmers already skilled in slash-and-burn farming or terrace agriculture due to the high density of the jungle. And that sounded much harder than tending to open fields.\nBack at the cottage, he noticed that his status page had taken on a new appearance. He wondered if the [System] was continuously updating itself, considering that it nerfed his [Whirlwind Whirl] in the past.\nLevel 1\nRange - 300 (1 meter)\nWeapon - Sword (Wooden)\nMoney - 5$\nHealth - 100/100\nMana - 50/50\nSpells - Fire Blast, Ice shot\nArmor - N/A\nStrength (STR) - 10\nDexterity (DEX) - 10\nConstitution (CON) - 10\nIntelligence (INT) - 10\nWisdom (WIS) - 10\nCharisma (CHA) - 10\nLuck (LUK) - 10\nDescription - Gobby the Goblin. They found a spellbook one day and learned fire and ice spells. Now, armed with a wooden sword, Gobby protects the forest from Shadow Sprites, spreading joy on their adventures.\nBut he didn’t understand what this was supposed to mean.\nThe [System] emerged and said: “Oh, sorry, that’s the wrong status page. We’ll fix it right back.” He chuckled.\nEventually, Matthew clasped hands with the [System] again, making a big smile on his face. He was in a good mood.\nChapter 55 - The Coalition Rises: Uniting Against Grimtusk linkShifting to a sudden breakdown of the gates of a remote village, villagers ran, embracing the wind.\nGrimtusk was coming along with his lackies: Maestro and Deadmeateater.\nThe villagers rushed down the hill, looking around.\nVillagers strewn all throughout the battlefield, who had been struck by Maestro’s traps, smiled, blood streaming down the top of their head, their eyes wet with tears.\nThe villagers who lived continued, their faces striken with grief.\nThey had to keep going.\nGrimtusk raged upon the streets of Zaun.\nThe villagers fled down into the cave chambers, huddling up in a corner.\nIf they could hide…\nA ice sword struck them. Deadmeateater’s exhausted face emerged.\nThe goblins jumped and fled. Two were too injured to go on.\nDeadmeateater brutally ran after them, striking them down again and again.\nGrimtusk’s shadow stretched further, influencing Deadmeateater down the path of glory.\nThe villagers fell to the earth, their bodies wet like sand on a beach.\nThe eyes of God stared upon them, and they were glad to have lived.\nDeadmeateater was no longer to be seen, because they were already dead. He had moved on past them. Their bodies lay on the cave floor, their faces and expressions still, their eyes lifeless. Their fleeting souls were the only left to observe the scene.\nThe villagers only wanted to make cake, cut trees, and eat bread, their lives streaming down to a river of blood created by Grimtusk the Wise. His form took up space as a giant statue over the horizon. He was their All-father.\nShifting to one villager’s perspective, his name was Noah, a young man who warned the world of a coming flood. This flood would not be a physical one, but it would be the Grimtusk: “Then,” he said, “shall the Grimtusk be likened unto a flood of waters…”\nThe smile on his face was one with a long past and a heavy longing for peace and prosperity—that his brethren and friends lay in peace was all he wanted.\nHe fell to the earth, embracing the ground.\nBut with this expression of defeat, he used a skill.\nHe ran, charging the Grimtusk.\nBut he was far, and the waves of villagers pushing back against his team was dwindling.\nNoah kept running, wishing to embrace defeat, but his heart knew that Heaven had given him victory.\nHe struck Grimtusk, wishing only harm upon his being.\nBut the more harm people wished upon him, the more Grimtusk knew strategically where and how to adjust his team to optimal effectiveness.\nHe immediately destroyed them, having utilized his eye-catching presence as bait.\nHe was not their friend. He was not their enemy.\nBut today, he would be whatever people needed him to be. The cries of hands tearing through the barriers he had placed to prevent burnout and insanity broke through and made him their slave. He was a slave to progress and to the improvement of the goblin race—the villagers’ lives were worthless in this path. His human members were surprised, and they soon left. Grimtusk could not contain his love for the [System]. He had always enjoyed its gifts, so why be a hypocrite? He would fully accept his purpose now. The [System] that brought him here would become his enabler, and he would become the figure standing above the people to lead them and to make them see faith realized.\nShifting to Matthew, when he heard about this event, he was troubled. But he had ignored many quests, many events, and many pleas for help during his time here in this world.\nBut he had to do something this time, now that he was a friend of goblins. And these 15 goblins insisted that they wanted to help stop him.\nHe went toward Grimtusk.\nBut he was lost.\nHe had no resources.\nGrimtusk was far away.\nThe village he razed was far away.\nThe village had wanted to stay away in order to have their peace, but it backfired on them severely.\nMatthew grabbed his forehead. “I can do this… Brain, let’s do this… Come on…”\nHe needed friends, and he had them.\nA coalition emerged in response to the threat of Grimtusk, but many people were crying out and eventually silenced: “Why didn’t you come sooner! Why did no one come help us! Why are we here dying!”\nVillagers were often the first to fall. They were the fodder when enemies invaded.\nMatthew knew that, and that was why (だから) he had to do something about it.\nHe had to crush the Hittites all over again, and Grimtusk and his fellows were the Hittites today.\nThe coalition battled the elements, as they pressed forward, energized by intellect, preparation, willpower, and the influence of Matthew.\nIf Grimtusk could convince a goblin who had never killed a human to do so, then Matthew even more so.\nMatthew assessed his environment. They had to continue marching, but they had to be careful.\nGoblins could be anywhere, and they didn’t want to waste their time in suspension due to a lack of resources.\nNow because the terrain was challenging to navigate through, they had to set up a camp at each point of the journey. If they mobilized at the location of Grimtusk, they would be tired and easy to defeat. So their plan was to choke Grimtusk out by spreading around and focusing on strategic locations on the humans’ side of the territory while swooping and controlling local populations as well that might be hiding in these rainforests within the territory. Then, they could hopefully “shoot” at Grimtusk by extending long tendrils of attack from one of these camps once they were sufficiently close. Of course, these long tendrils meant risk. However, that would only be viable once they established a strong presence in this region.\nSecretly assassinating Grimtusk with humans was impossible, since Grimtusk and his team, being goblins, would easily detect a human enemy. Furthermore, using friendly goblins was not plausible because the humans didn’t have powerful goblins on hand.\nIn the end, this was their best bet to kill Grimtusk, as they didn’t have flying vehicles. They didn’t have a river to traverse in order to get to Grimtusk, but they would be passing by the edge of a lake.\nThe village was also under a different city, so Matthew’s presence here would be entering the borders of different territory.\nDungeons would also be significant barriers, as monsters were continuously spawning from them and exiting, making their way onto the surface and into the forest. But the good thing was that the animals of the ecosystem were protected magically by the rainforest. As long as the humans preserved the forest, the animals would be kept safe from eradication.\nIn the end, killing Grimtusk would take a long time.\nMatthew had to be patient.\nHe focused on connecting with people, using the camps as a platform to influence them into conversations. Naturally, due to the scale of its ambition and its novel and wide reach over a huge portion of the region, the coalition began accepting new adventurers, and eventually, it transitioned away from a coalition to that of a new identity—it made up a new hotspot, even if its original purpose was to attack Grimtusk. In other words, the shared purpose of attacking Grimtusk convinced adventurers to join, but the area ended up functioning as a new base of operations for adventurers similar to the controlled dungeon steps Matthew saw before.\nHe met numerous people, but he wasn’t at all focused on them.\nNevertheless, they each carried pasts of their own.\nMatthew waited until three familiar adventurers took the scene: Lumi, Thorne, and Elara.\nThorne, wearing his characteristic hood and robe and wielding his lightning staff, bearded, asked if there were drinks and food around here as of the moment.\nMatthew said they were still in preparation, and it would take some time before the camps started having more established stalls and amenities.\nLumi didn’t bother doing anything, just sitting down and reading a book. It was unusual and hinted at a wealthier background.\nElara was busy watching adventurers spar, hoping to interact with them and spar with them herself; though, she was a little shy and trying to be polite since it was Matthew’s place. Usually, she would be a lot more daring.\nMatthew sat down in front of Lumi at the same table, but before he could say anything, Lumi showed him one of her artifacts to distract him for the time because she wanted to finish what she was reading.\nThorne didn’t want to sit down, so he walked around aimlessly, observing around. He just spoke a little to the people at the stall, asking around awkwardly.\nSince he felt lost, he decided to lie down on the wagon he had brought here to rest.\nThe night was long, and Matthew glanced at Lumi reading from time to time, having been distant from Lumi, Thorne, and Elara for a while. Lumi saw his stares from her peripheral vision, and soon, she entertained him: “What is it?”\nMatthew smiled politely before pressing his lips seriously, saying, “You know, it’s crazy, right?”\n“What’s crazy?”\n“It’s just crazy how much we’ve… all of us…we’ve been doing so much—We’ve done a lot.”\nLumi kept her eyes on her book, but she glanced curiously at him every few seconds, signalling him to continue.\nMatthew laughed to himself before saying, “Do you remember when Mr. Lobatu fell while he was getting his artifact. I was laughing so hard after he told us that it was an accident, but he really wasn’t… It was as if he wasn’t even having an accident.”\n“Yeah,” Lumi said. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”\n“Oh, okay.”\nShe switched topic. “Did you get the levels put into your current weapons and armor for repair like we talked about?” Thorne came by to hand them some food he bought before he left because he was too tired to converse.\n“Uh, no… I actually lost my levels. I’m pretty sure you know that, right.”\n“Yeah. But I was thinking before that happened, right?”\n“Yeah. I forgot. Sorry.”\nShe put down the book. “So, seriously, though, how are you doing now? I’ve been seeing people say you did the coalition, And quests and that. I… was surprised that you did that. But are you… You’ve changed.”\n“Huh?” Matthew felt offended for some reason, taking a bite out of the apple pie Thorne had brought. “What do you mean?”\nLumi furrowed her brows at his offended reaction. “I’m just saying…” She sounded tense for a moment before she shifted to a consoling tone. “You’re… everybody changes, and that’s normal of course. I’m just… It’s… something.” She took a sip out of a coffee cup before he jumped when a cat brushed against her calves.\nAfter looking under the table from the side, Matthew returned to his posture and nodded. “Yeah, you’re right. I did go through stuff I guess.”\nLumi pressed her lips together, shooing the cat with a stick she found on the floor. “I’ve been wondering if you still want to do normal stuff. You’ve been placed here, and I’m not saying you’re not doing well. I’m saying that wouldn’t you like to relax and have… you know… a normal time? You’re being forced—you know—to do this. It’s not fair to you, I feel. I feel that you deserve to be given a break? You’ve been here only for 6 months?”\nMatthew meowed at the kitty and invited him to sit at the bench. “Yeah. I do need a break, but I also don’t know what else to do. If I lie down, I won’t be able to feel anything but discomfort.”\nLumi sunk her shoulders, slouching and leaning her arms and elbows against the table, lowering her head, her two-handed grip on the book relaxing. The book leaned toward Matthew diagonally enough for him to see the fancy text. “But do you want to… go with us?” she said. “We’re going to Power. We’re planning to take on a couple quests with trolls, and it’s going to take a months, probably a year and a half or two. If you want to come, you can come with us.”\nMatthew raised his leg and placed it over his other leg, leaning to the right due to the uneven table. Part of the table was situated on a pile of gravel. He moved the table a bit institively before he glanced at Lumi, who he was surprised to see not caring the slightest about him shaking the table. “Really…?”\nLumi’s relaxed, lazy demeanor with the side of her face resting against her right fist; her arms making two lying V shapes, her elbows pointing outward to the sides. “Yeah!”\nMatthew took a deep breath as he rubbed his mouth. “I… want to come, I guess, but I’m also here. I don’t know. I should really do something different, but I don’t know. I just think this is fine for now. It’s not the best, of course. It’s not easy. I think it’s the only thing that I have to think about. If I think about anything else, I’ll just go crazy.”\nLumi yawned with her mouth wide open without covering it. “Well, uh, if you want to come, just tell me. I’ll stay… be staying here for the duration of… around 1 week. If you want to come, just tell me… okay?”\n“Sure.” Mattew noticed a passing group of adventurers laughing with Elara in good humor.\n“Oh, by the way, can you still use your healing? Can you remove the itch on my neck?” She had been sweating for a while now with her hair down, so she kept cloth to rub her sweat. But her skin was sensitive to irritation. Her neck still itched from earlier when her hair was tied. She was too sweaty and in a hurry to get here to the camp to remove the many bags and her extra layers of clothes, accessories, armor, and items to untie it at the time.\nAfter they took a short pause during which Matthew healed her neck, he changed the topic: “But how are you doing?” Instead of returning to his seat, he sat next to Lumi. He also rubbed his arm because it was starting to get cold and windy.\nLumi was surprised. Matthew rarely asked her about her.\nAfter making sure her book was aligned, she said: “Oh, um, recently, I’ve been finding several rabbit holds. I’m talking about kingdoms of rabbits. That’s actually what we’ve been doing for the past month of so. We were tasked by the adventurer guild “Romolo,” and I came here because you were here but also because we were allowed to visit here for a while. The actual location of these kingdoms of rabbits is two hours from now… or from here. They’re not really hard to find, but they can be hard to infiltrate, you know.”\nMatthew noticed a new group of adventurers entering a camp, speaking in hushed tones among each other. “Huh, really?”\nLumi followed his eyes and twisted her body, seeing the group as well before returning to her posture. “Yeah, so when he engage in these excursions—it’s not really that difficult, but it can be long—we go around this circle.”\nMatthew frowned and nodded pensively. “Yeah.”\nLumi raised her arms to stretch her arms behind her. “It’s magical, so it prevents us from entering. And Thorne—you know Thorne, right—so his magic is actually five-leveled.”\nMatthew did a light stretch as well without thinking. “Okay.”\nLumi stood up to get her body going since she was getting sleepy. “You know what that means? It has five… layers… of electricity.”\nMatthew heard the loud adventurer parties all around him. They were bringing various loot frm their travels during the afternoon. It was currently night, so it was a good time to start unpacking and returning to rest. “What? What’s that?”\nLumi observed the crowds gathering to see the loot. “First level is like when it has circles around first very quickly and then it enters into this, like, stationary stage where it’s quiet and nothing moves.”\nMatthew saw Elara approaching the table. “That’s… I have no idea what that means.”\nWhen Elara saw that they were talking, she turned around and returned to the crowd.\nLumi said: “But as soon as something touches, it explodes. He has to stay in a dark place, and he has to be five meters, yeah five meters, away from direct sun.”\nMatthew said, “W-what kind of direct sun?”\n“So if he’s standing inside a cave, he has to be in the dark, but he also has to be 5 meters away from the nearest, like, outside. It takes a while to find a good location that’s basically this.”\n“So he’s in a dark place five meters from sun, direct sun?”\n“Yeah, so the second level, third level, fourth level, fifth level is even more complex. But basically, we use, or we have Thorne do this first in order to make it easier for us because the rabbits have magical barriers.”\nShe had been repeatedly making a circular motion with her right index finger. She continued: “So it gets kind of… So you can imagine how much effort it takes to enter into this, like, land. It ’s not a land because it has lots of networks and it moves around somewhat.”\n“Okay.”\n“It’s internally complex… basically… yeah. The kingdom of rabbits is where we have to go into the middle to get the dungeon core. It’s not actually a dungeon core, but it’s like a dungeon core.”\n“I have no idea what a dungeon core is. I mean I’ve heard about it. But I haven’t seen it.”\n“Okay, so anyway—when we finally get it. It’s so big. It becomes big basically. And it turns the entire… place upside-down. And we have to retreat as well, but we aren’t just reliant on Thorne of course.”\n“So Thorne is not your leader.”\n“Yeah of course. Elara actually is probably more than a leader than Thorne and me. She has to use her poison abilities to make sure we don’t get choked. And that’s why. We can’t live”—she chuckled—actually without her poison. So yeah, basically.” She snickered. “Then… of course, there’s also me.\n“Right.”\n“We use me. I use… my skill to help out with clearing the trees when we get to the middle. Then, the trees are so thick, and it gets difficult. And these dungeons are not dungeons. They’re… Again, they’re kingdoms. So imagine a forest with a castle, but it’s not a big castle. And it’s not a big forest. It’s around the size of a person. But it’s also very wide, and they have all these magic skills that create these circular things. It’s like giant balls that ruin our casting. That’s not the only thing of course. But it’s a lot. Like really a lot. And it differs every time. That’s what it makes it so difficult. You get me?”\n“Okay,” Matthew said. “I don’t know what you’re saying, but okay. But I kind of get it. The forests are usually the problem when we have our operations. So you can imagine”—he chuckled—“how fast we have to be to make sure that we’re not stuck and dead in our tracks because they’re all around us right. So yeah, I understand that, you know, why you have to be careful. And—you know—you and your skills are required. I know why.”\n“Yeah. That’s what I’m saying.”\n“But you know… I… I know Thorne and Elara. It’s clear to see you guys work well together. I’m not surprised all of you—Thorne, you, and Elara—are doing well, you know. I believe that you guys… really… have the necessary skills, and honestly, if you were a part of the team—of course, it’s fine if you were not—I think you would do well; three of you. And the intel you guys would provide would be astounding.”\nLumi rarely got a chance to have someone outside of Thorne and Elara listen to her, so she was glad that she had somebody to talk to. Most people expected something from her or assumed things about her, but Matthew didn’t really care in a good way.\nThe sky was bright with hopeful stars, and in this camp and after investing a lot into this new quest to defeat Grimtusk, Matthew had only little time to spare before this set off a series of events that would remove him entirely from normalcy. Meanwhile, his friends’ company, spearheaded currently by Lumi, served as a way for him to forget briefly the pressures and expectations weighing upon him. He had prepared so long to reach this point that he could respond to threats like Grimtusk, and even if he had been someone else at one point, he would not stop now.\nChapter 56 - The Awakening of Freedom link“Where are my brothers, Matthew?” said a goblin, the brother of the goblins that included Finesse, the late goblin with whom Matthew had signed a contract.\n“Am I your brothers’ keeper?” Matthew said.\n“What have you done? Listen! My brothers’ blood cries out to me from the ground.”\nMatthew woke up from this dream, but he had also dreamed of other dreams. One of these dreams had been about the sun, moon, and eleven stars bowing down to him.\nMatthew disappeared. He died.\nHis soul was now stuck in his position.\nAnd he was beginning to realize that.\nThe more power he got, the more he lost agency.\nHis humanity, personality, and unique characteristics were fading away to make way for a role that many others could fulfill.\nHe wasn’t exactly the best strategist, but it was his previous hunger for power and his ability to network with adventurers and his headstart that allowed him to reach this point.\nHe was loyal, and that was what led others to put him on a pedestal. But now that he was here, his self had died.\nHe was now someone in the background, filling a generic role, which effectively acted as a cage.\nHis struggles remained under the surface, but each time he was asked to uphold the responsibilies asked of him, he pushed himself forward to fill in the gap like many fathers did, curbing the sense of self in the process and crushing what made him him.\nHe had desires, and he still didn’t care about any of this. Even if people were struggling, he was forcing himself still to fulfill this role.\nHe was growing tired, and maybe Lumi was right. Maybe, he did need a break.\nBut he pretended as if he never cared like a father who had resolved to keep everything he felt under the surface to carry the burden of providing for his family—all emotions and humanity disappeared. And when these feelings came out, they came out very, very badly in the form of anger, rage, and physical attacks.\nThat was why he was worried, because he knew that it could happen any moment now—his breakdown—all that suppressed energy bursting forth.\nHe was too human.\nHe decided to leave the role and hand it over to someone else.\nHe ran to the forest, where he met Lumi, Thorne, and Elara, his new companions for the next 6 months.\nHe stood up and let on the seventh month, preparing himself mentally.\nName: Matthew Cruz\nLevel: 55\nCurrent experience: 3\nSpecies: Human\nAge: 26\nSkills: [Phantom Shield]\nSpells: None / None\nVitality: 16\nQuests:\nTitles: [Goblin Slayer], [Skeleton Slayer], [Overlord’s Gifted]\nUnused stat points: 0.64\nAttack Damage🪓: 85 + (10 from [Strength Beacon])\nAbility Power🔥: 27\nArmor🛡️: 57\nMagic Resistance🚫: 60\nHealth🗿: 2355\nMana💧: 350\nMana regeneration💧 (per 10 minutes): 7\nPreviously, he spent all his unused points of health, going from 1129 to 2355 health. He also noticed that he got one [Vitality] since the last time he checked.\nReturning to the present, he was 26 now, having had his birthday this month. According to the [System], it was currently May 1. And his birthday was on May 1.\nThat contributed to his bold decision to leave too.\nHe didn’t want to be tied down or controlled by expectations.\nIf he ever knew what was going to happen next, he had to disrupt it. He feared losing himself in a box.\nHe needed to break free.\nHe jumped, as if angel wings sprang forth from his bang, his impact on the ground thunderous, his legs elegant and his arms carefully alighting.\nHe knew how powerful he truly was. He would not be hindered.\nThorne let out lighting strikes, breaking hundreds of goblins to the ground.\nMatthew knew well that the people back home were looking for him. But he couldn’t do it anywhere. He ghosted them.\nHe was free.\nLumi shot five rocks all at once, breaking a gate with her fourth one. The fifth one broke through enemy lines.\nElara raised her wings and flew, shooting blasts of flame as she flew around in a circle to avoid the counterattacks at her. This was her superior justice.\nMatthew would not hesitate to kill a goblin. He had to be callous to survive around these parts, and where would the rage go? Back again to war. A cycle of sorrow and guilt and the oncoming rageful bursts that led him to elegant gestures of superiority where his sword slashed in a flourishing manner. He would tie down those goblins before he would allow himself to be tied down. He needed freedom more than anything, not to be tied down.\nHe struck waves upon waves of goblins, forgetting the techniques of Zoey and crafting his own path, build, and tree.\nThe goblins surrounded him, chipping down his health, but he was too tough. So he destroyed them all in a flurry.\n“Not again. Not anymore!” He struck them down without torturing them. He had moved past his trauma.\nHe was now free indeed.\nSome time since the [System] gave him access to the [Forums], he had been browsing it and using it to understand the world like one used the Internet; however, it was very limited. Some of the people he stayed in contact with included those who had given him the witch orb that he currently had and that he had been consistently since he got it. He was headed to one of them as well, and he told Thorne, Lumi, and Elara about it, saying that he had magic that could show him the location of an old friend. The client with whom he had created a magical bond that updated his current location and [System] status to them had was this friend. They were pressing him to go to them since Matthew’s death made it so that the magical bond was not actively working but also registered as not destroyed either. So it was impossible for them to create another magical bond through the [Forums]. This was why the client insisted for Matthew to come to them face-to-face because they were sure they had a way to break Matthew’s magic bond restriction.\nMatthew was not very strong whatsoever. To be more accurate, he was overloaded with time and support from others, the city’s [Strength Beacon], City of Power’s soothing effect, the witch orb, Lumi’s artifacts, Desmond’s help, and so many more. That was what made him untouchable—networking. Far from a mastermind, Matthew Cruz was a walking paradox. He prolonged a pointless goblin war, despite recognizing its folly. He aligned himself with the supposedly uptight Michel, contradicting his past criticism. He escalated monstrous blitzkriegs even when victory seemed impossible.\nThis stemmed from a brutal past. Tortured by goblins, Matthew fled to the human city. Here, he mastered the intricacies of power, navigating both political and personal landscapes. These skills propelled him to the pinnacle—close to the city’s most powerful adventurers, with their might at his command.\nMatthew’s guiding principle? There wasn’t one. Shifting alliances, covert dungeon raids, sabotaging negotiations, and backing ruthless foreign adventurershe did it all. This ruthless pragmatism shattered countless lives, leaving a lasting scar on the region.\nEven today, Matthew wouldn’t face repercussions. He was the ultimate player, adored by powerful figures across the board. But here was the lesson for his former allies: Matthew’s disappearance highlighted the dangers of unchecked power concentrated in one man.\nHis mental breakdowns were real, but there was some merit in thinking that he had adapted very efficiently all while orchestrating plans for his lucky break.\nNow, this Matthew was truely him, even if only an aspect, but the issue was that he didn’t see it that way. So he never made it the point of his focus.\nHe had many reasons to be doing things, and that was what made his actions justified, even if it was only for him.\nHe said he was not running away, and many might share the same conclusion. But it depended on perspective really.\nThe God that people looked up to was only a man.\nHe shielded himself from the ruthlessness of his actions that when others saw him, they didn’t see him as such.\nIn conclusion, he was only a regular man, and any immediate and striking success would outpaced by the need to adapt to challenges far beyond his whole life up to that point. He was a baby in the face of difficulties that his simple mind could not comprehend.\nThis combination of intelligent and dumb was evident in almost every man, except the ideal of godhood.\nIntelligent enough to slice precisely his opponents, but struggling with the consequences of going against his moral code.\nAs for others…\nCallous enough to escape the guilt and shame typically arising from murder, but unempathetic enough that they couldn’t understand the will of kindness and empathy and often found themselves at a loss as to what to do, only imitating, but never experiencing truly their complexities. As a result, they had a deficit in a fundamental aspect of a human being, walking askew with a gaping hole instead of a vast ocean of understanding and realization.\nBut there was victory in being human, even with all its flaws, inconsistencies, hypocrisies, and contradictions, even with the defence mechanisms intended to mitigate emotional adverse effects and the concealing of what one felt inside in order to keep the harmony.\nHumanity was, at its core, unable to be defied.\nChange and unpredictability were human.\nHe woke up in front of a large gate, and nothing ever stayed the same.\nHe removed his armor and his weapons, laying them on the ground. He walked toward the light.\nThere, he found himself accompanied by legions of soldiers. This was a place of battle, and he was near the King.\nThis was not King Aethelred III who had used an orb to watch Matthew. This was another king, popularly referred to as the the King of Mercy.\nThe King addressed Matthew’s presence, who had established himself as an up-and-coming power-holder: “Mercy, my middle name, and my greatest honor. I command thee down to the ground. Your life is beauty itself. Tear away your disgusting clothes.”\n“Ah, yes, yes,” Matthew said. He then removed his purple and yellow [Shadow Assassin Outfit] and dropped them on the ground for the soldiers to pick up and toss away onto a wagon.\nThis was all a part of the ceremony of entry, but more importantly, the King himself was the client with whom Matthew had worked with to get his witch orb.\nHe knew now once he saw him.\nThat was why Mark didn’t feel afraid of leaving.\nHe was leaving his team to another bigger and greater one, one that had long established connections with him.\nThis was a favorable sight.\nEventually, he was tasked with dismantling the various cracked walls filling up a tree-covered area. These walls had spawned from the underground dungeons; the dungeon cores breathing life and testing out their vision. They could see through these walls.\nThat was his task—[Eliminate the Wall-eyes!]\nTask Name Duration Left\nClearing Wall-eyes Matthew Cruz 2 days:59 hours:59 minutes\nMatthew struck them down one by one, his heart in the action, while Thorne, Lumi, and Elara helped him out by shooting them and backing off once it was about one hit from breaking. This was their current mission, one where they agreed to pool rewards in.\nIn the meantime, Thorne, Lumi, and Elara delagated roles to goblin slaves, handing them simple tools and goods to consume. They lasted for 3 days before they tired, but the items they found were interesting: bugbear skin, bugboar tusk, boogie slime, camel hump, carrion crawler egg, catoblepas neck, centaur rib, centipede leg, cockatrice wattle, couatl wing, crayfish antenna, demogorgon tentacle, jubilex gel, manes tooth, orcus wand, succubus bra, and vrock neck. They gathered in from the nearby diversely populated area, where many biomes and adventurers sprawled throughout, like a giant nest containing the whole world.\nWhen they picked it up, it easy-come-easy-go. They left the most common items to the goblins to share between each other. They sold these and went on their way, returning to the city to visit their friends and family at the slave mine town.\nAll the while, Matthew browsed through the uncommon items left with him and the other three adventurers. They included items like camel hump, which was used for medicine in some places, so it was worth the catch because merchants were willing to pay an exclusive price for it since they were getting to sell it for so much at their next destination. It was a pattern of come and go.\nHe noted how none of the items fitted together in any way, so he decided to throw them into a large container that he bought from a shopkeeper passing by and making her way to a child.\nThis child was a fire-breather, wearing tight clothes that revealed her capacity to breathe air from her skin, pores all over her clothes. It was a good thing the fire kept her modesty, as she was always breathing, thus always covered. The good Matthew was glad to see a strong sport make her way down the common road. It was a reminder of the good old days of childhood.\nMoving on to another aspect, Lumi arranged various items on a table, showing Matthew her remaining artifacts, after selling most of them to merchants, greedy adventurers, and the military. It became clear that whatever she had left was essential only for traveling—not too dangerous that cities would be wary of her, not too weak that she looked like a lamb in the middle of the street surrounded by prongs of shadows elevated about.\nShifting to Thorne, whose eyes were beginning to grow weary again, he had much to explain to Matthew about this new city. It had lots of cows, and it had lots of sheep. But it also had many dogs that bit. Even then, he encouraged Matthew to explore it by himself, giving more of an encouragement than an explanation if anything in the end.\nWith that ended, Matthew was immediately thrust into his new environment, accompanied by Elara’s slave goblins.\nVarious little fresh flowers bloomed in the midnight air, as Matthew paved the path toward a new journey, his eyes bouncing up and down as he looked around with excitement, his legs gaining momentum as he ran.\nThe goblins were getting tired.\nThe bright side was that Matthew was not suspected of anything despite his flamboyance and aggressive exploration due to warnings the King slipped into the guards’ ears with regard to him. The witch orb that signified the King’s connection with Matthew was currently under Matthew’s hands, specifically still kept inside a pouch, where it leapt up and down as his momentum bounced.\nChapter 57 - Marchacha linkAfter completing the Wall-eyes, Matthew accepted his reward and moved on, his focus moving over to the King’s options for him.\nType of Quest Description Combat Quests Defeat a Monster Slay a dangerous creature that threatens the kingdom.

Friendly fire wasn’t possible, since everyone here was shielded. It was a much more luxurious town, so it had better drainage systems and even trees nicely organized with magical woods that didn’t burn and handled the stress of foot and vehicular traffic.\nHe breathed deeply, his heart staying high and relaxed, not a single dip in his cadence and gait.\nAfter entering a dungeon, he was tasked with carrying a few rocks before he was sent to another senior soldier with a scar on his face. It was the usual treatment on being sent throughout the tree network of the hierarchy to get used to functions.\nAs soon as he was appropriately introduced here, he was then made to file some paperwork, making sure every single faculty or aspect of governance knew his existence. This way, they could keep track of his presence. Mark wasn’t exactly surprised since the King, his former client or work partner, had signed a contract with him to update the King on his status page at all times.\nAfter this was over, he finally slashed goblins, removing the younglings who had been presented to him at the cave. It was freshly syruppy like the presence of succulent vegetables at a meat-laden event—very easy and relaxing.\nHe entered the second cave chamber, moving around and being made to clean up certain parts of the cave.\nThis took a while, and it was mostly manual work. But it served his expectations, because if they threw him under the wagon or elevated back to a place unfitting for his current state of mind, his gifts woud be wasted.\nAs time passed, he met different soldiers in the cave, having only been acquainted with adventurers. This was a new stage for him.\nHe met Agatha, Cornelius, Eudora, Horatio, Ignatius, Jethro, Lavinia, Mortimer, and Prudence, all bearing normal names compared to the adventurers back in his first city.\nAgatha was sitting down, adjusting her greaves. “I haven’t been acquainted with a man like you for a long time. Adventurers, huh? We don’t have them like you around here. They’re very cowardly, always looking for a way to steal loot. They body-steal. Yeah…”\nMatthew raised his brows, finding it hard to speak out against adventurers confidently. He shared his own version of aversion toward them, even if he was one. He was not like other adventurers.\nAgatha smiled, looking at Cornelius. “You see him? He’s a former adventurer, having been kicked out because he relied too much on the Knight’s Chivalry.”\n“Hmm?” Matthew said, glancing at her and then at Cornelius, a confused smile playing on his lips. He stretched his back after noticing that he was slumping out of an absent mind Meanwhile, Cornelius stared at his gauntlets, tearing out metal burrs with his hands only, using magic to enhance his strength. He knew Matthew was becoming more concerned as Cornelius avoided answering him despite being a short distance in front of him, especially with his display of strength.\nAfter he felt Matthew was sufficiently uncomfortable, he smiled with his brows furrowed like an arrogant warrior testing the confidence of an opponent and said, “Why do you even stand out here like that?” His tone was similarly vague.\nMatthew didn’t want to answer, looking at Agatha.\nEudora, Horatio, and Ignatius went in, coming through the back door of the dungeon. The dungeon was repurposed as a barracks; despite the usual danger posed by dangers, here, it had been made to be very safe.\nEudora dropped a pack of street food, placing them on a plate. He used his bare hands to hold them, since they were finger food. But he also wasn’t very hygienic.\nHoratio kept putting his hands over the food to prevent the heat of the food from dissipating through the air, even if the wind was dead in here.\nIgnatius was standing far back in between the door, keeping it open. He varied between three states: looking down and away as if he was in the middle of bored or despondent thought, glancing at the other people in the room except for Matthew with a disappointed half-glare, and pushing forward the door repeatedly by tapping, keeping his tapping hand still and waiting for the door to come right back to push it again. He didn’t really look comfortable with the idea of Matthew being there. Meanwhile, Matthew kept an eye on him, looking down at Agatha’s greaves and Corenelius’ gauntlets, keeping himself still looking in thought. He didn’t want to make eye contact with them, waiting for them to reveal their dynamics and what they felt about Matthew.\nCornelius showed him a small dead fragment of an artifact. “Look, a critter. Go outside.” It was a blatant expression of exclusion, with only a half-assed attempt at sounding polite and indirect.\nMatthew raised his brows subtly before walking out awkwardly, without looking at everyone, giving a clear conclusion and exit, and receiving reciprocation, without keeping his connection with all of them synchronized.\nIn the meantime, Cornelius glanced at Ignatius, motioning him in with a hand gesture. “Why didn’t you give him food? Why did you throw it on the table?”\nIgnatius was quiet.\nCornelius smiled slightly before he showed Ignatius an aged, faded, and tattered map. “Go to Asuta. We want you there, quickly.” His voice sounded urgent, but it felt like a guise.\nMatthew heard it, but it was muffled from his point of view, since he was already far out, staring at the grass. He felt weakened here, but it was important for him to undergo this as a form of training.\nAgatha glancd at Horatio, grabbing the food and tasting it. “Don’t buy this. You should check Store A. They have better food there. If you want, you can check Mr. Eluf. He hadn’t been at the shop recently, but his wife is there. Tell her that you’re doing this for the army. She’ll give it you straight.” She winked perfunctorily, her gaze serious and uncaring.\nHoratio nodded, not too daunted, but his posture was still, given that Cornelius was shaking his greaves as he stood. They were all making sure they wouldn’t fall off the next time they faced a goblin mercenary that cast an armor-removng spell two days prior.\nCornelius was humiliated then, so everyone kept a respective degree of distance, only present physically but not in the same room really.\nCornelius left without saying a word, looking for Matthew.\n“Matthew!” he shouted, his voice with slight excitement.\nMatthew looked askance at him, his posture pointed sideways and away. “What?” he said doubtfully.\nCornelius smirked with brows furrowed—a common expression from him.\nMatthew waited for Cornelius to attack him; instead, Cornelius placed his arm on his shoulders. “Let’s head to the dungeon,” Cornelius said with a grin. “I want to see your abilities. The King was particularly approving to my captain about it.”\nMatthew didn’t feel tense anymore. It didn’t feel malicious. He let his shoulders droop with calm. “Okay,” he said, a little confused.\nThey entered the cave, Cornelius showing him a spare pair of greaves. “Look at this. See that marking, etching?”\nBefore Matthew could reply, Cornelius grabbed Horatio, glancing at Agatha, who stood too far for him to grab her. “Horatio… actually found this in a dungeon not far from here. Want to visit there?”\nMatthew saw the greaves. It was good and enchanted. It looked like 100 levels were put into it, but that only confused him. He said honestly, “Why aren’t you using this?”\nCornelius pushed Horatio, surprising him, before laughing jokingly. “I’m keeping it! For later!”\nMatthew watched Horatio’s face, getting Cornelius’ attention. “Why?” Cornelius said. “What’s wrong?” He was very assertive.\nMatthew grinned slightly before it reverted to a still expression. “I’m surprised…” He paused. “That the dungeon thing was actually not far from here.” He was trying to change the subject.\nCornelius grabbed Matthew on the shoulder, getting a physical response from Agatha. “Why’re you lying? I know you want to go with me! Let’s go!” Cornelius, despite his enthusiastic tone, displayed a warning stare at Agatha as he led Matthew out with his hand over his shoulder. He was domineering.\nThe other soldiers followed, waiting for their captain to return. Cornelius liked “messing with them,” at least according to his wording.\nWhen they finally reached a dungeon, Cornelius excitedly showed Matthew a map, pointing at three different locations. “That’s Marsh, Redush, and Maestro. You just need three gems to access all three locations. But first! Let’s check out the Goblin Mines. They’ve been cleared out already since we’ve come. But you know that we’ll find one of them hiding somewhere!” He grabbed the air and pretended to choke it as if it was a goblin, getting a concerned stare from Matthew before it disappeared when Cornelius confronted him with a gaze. “So, what do you think? Cornelius said.\nMatthew nodded, raising his brows instinctively to maximize a display of agreement. “Yeah… yeah, yeah! It’s good. We should… bring the others?”\n“Yeah!” He then yelled at the adventurers, who had been following far behind, angrily. “Why are you guys not here yet! Stop stalling!”\nThe other soldiers came by them one by one, Agatha standingat the back and looking around with a hand over her eyes as if worried that people were following. Then, she joined them.\nCornelius and Matthew were acting as vanguard today.\nMatthew saw a single goblin sweating and tired on the ground.\nCornelius stepped and stamped the goblin on the thin leg. The goblin squealed softly, too tired to yell for long. Cornelius said, “See, here, we can try to look for others like him. There’s about fifty around this multi-chamber… multi-tunnel network. So you just have to look hard to enough…” He trailed off, as he gazed at Agatha and the rest of the soldiers. “Why are you guys stalling?” he said softly, his hand resting upon Matthew’s back.\nHe then grabbed his tunic and began fanning Matthew’s back with it.\nAgatha said: “We didn’t bring anything. Are we checking or what?”\nThe goblin below Cornelius’ foot laughed, staring and pointing at the group of goblins approaching with terrified but determined demeanors.\nCornelius was looking at Agatha before Agatha gestured at the goblins with her eyes.\nCornelius paused, keeping his eyes at Agatha, before he slowly turned at the goblins. “Ooh…” he said softly. “What’s this?” He sounded genuinely confused.\nThe goblins threw a spear, hitting Cornelius and getting him bad.\nCornelius fell to the ground, dying.\nThe goblins threw even more.\nSeveral more spears came, hitting Horatio and Eudora.\nAgatha’s eye gesture at Cornelius earlier was that of terror.\nThey didn’t think the Marchacha goblins were here.\nThey were the most powerful goblins in the region.\nMatthew was standing still when a spear stabbed into Cornelius again, making his body jiggle.\nMatthew looked at the spears again before he suddenly dodged and contorted his body aside, running headfirst into the outside of the cave.\nAgatha was behind them, getting caught and removed from existence from the onslaught of goblins.\nHornatio stared at Eudora, as they crawled away from the cave. They had worn enchanted armor and cast magic shields and were only hit on the legs, so they were still partially alive.\nThe goblins, when they finished off Agatha, then turned to them, crowding all over them and surrounding them, no longer visible from Matthew’s point of view.\nMatthew was distraught, his hands over his mouth, his eyes wide open. “Argh…” he said aggressively before growling. “Damn it!” Tears dripped down his face. He had never seen such brutality before.\nHe then entered the cave, prepared to save Eudora and Hornatio.\nHe slashed them apart, glancing at Agatha’s non-existent body before he ripped off the rest of the goblins.\nThe goblins were fast and strong, but they were fragile like paper.\nHe scared the rest of them off with his dominance. He grabbed Cornelius’ body and tossed it aside next to Hornatio and Eudora’s bodies. The other soldiers, Jethro, Lavinia, Mortimer, and Prudence, were the other members of this squad of soldiers, but they weren’t here.\nMatthew fell, sitting on a flat rock, before he slumped down to the ground. “What the f…” he repeated again and again before he screamed, “What the fuck!”\nCornelius’ expression was still. If he was here, he would have said: “Where did you come from? Mom! Mom! Mom!”\nMatthew snapped in rage, kicking and slamming the wall and then the ground.\nAgatha was not here anymore. Horatio and Eudora were dead. “Why fucking now…” Matthew’s lonely voice echoed inside the multi-tunnel network.\n“This is normal…” said Jethro, as he entered the cave.\n“Why are you, what are you doing?”\n“I just saw it just now, using my mini-map magic. I can see people from there, and I saw that Cornelius, Agatha, and there, the two next to you, died earlier…”\n“Why are you here… just now!” Matthew yelled in agony.\nJethro snorted. “Don’t kid with me. They were my friends,” he cried, voice breaking. “I’m only pretending here, okay! I’m only… pretending…” His voice fell to a mumble.\nMatthew didn’t realize it, but Jethro had all the signs of a shocked and grieving friend, copious sweat dripping down his face, clothes wet with sweat, eyes pouring with tears, arms and hands red from slamming them against a table or a wall. He was too preoccupied with his own emotions to notice, so he calmed down temporarily to focus on Jethro. “I’m sorry,” he said calmly, almost like a robot. “I’m so sorry.”\nJethro snorted, but without derision this time. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, smiling. “I’m sorry too.”\nMatthew smiled, a little awkward. He wasn’t used to being said sorry to.\nJethro then sat down on the ground, mirroring Matthew’s crossed-leg sitting. They were facing away from each other but toward a shared center in the room.\nAs they sat idly, they slowly realized their faults and their failures.\nThey both cried, even asynchronously at times, but they shared a sense that things could be better from now out, even if they didn’t really know each other at all.\nThey both were humanity’s last strands, it felt like.\n“Sorry, again,” Jethro said in a friendly tone.\nBoth shook hands.\n“Yeah, it’s alright.”\nToday was not their last day.\nThey would move forward.\nThey left together, heading back to the city to report the incident.\nThis would start many successive events outside and within their plans.\nChapter 58 - Embracing the Hollowed Heart linkOther strategists back in Emerald Haven, Matthew’s first city, considered the possibility of having the focus of King Aethelred III be with the fortified dungeon steps as the entry to a route leading to another more effective angle into their current objective instead of the route they were currently focusing on. However, the timing of the King was initially off, and he chose to focus his efforts elsewhere. Matthew could have very well been a much more effective leader if the King offered him the opportunity, but Aethelred was very passive and indifferent about it.\nThe adventurer guild at which Desmond Leroy was incumbent decided to move their priorities elsewhere.\nMatthew was now free.\nReturning to the moment, after Matthew and Jethro parted ways and returned home, Matthew went inside an inn and stayed there, surprised that the innkeeper showed him to a large room. When he asked, she said that the inn was controlled directly by the King, and they directed her to give him the largest room they had.\nMatthew didn’t understand, but he was too tired to do so anyway. He was still bearing the hurt of seeing the soldiers die.\nHe raised his hand, bursting out everything he had holding inside, saying: “The deaths of millions should not be laid to rest without the grandiosity of the masses. They will have peace, and sure, go ahead. I can’t change that. But still, I hunger. And it is only for me, for me… But I bleed to become this thing… I bleed to become this soul. This fire. This spirit. I must stare upon the everything. I see beauty. And I can’t help but feel this great… thing in my heart that longs… It longs for this sense… It feels this reality. Beauty all around me… I see beauty all around me. But I can’t… I can’t for the life of me… feel anything but this… nothing… I want to appreciate them. I really do… But I am inevitably limited. I have to become everything… I need to become the epitome of grace and beauty. I mean, what else can I be? I have to crush everything that causes grief and pain. I cannot watch them suffer any longer. I must be there for them… helping them… telling them it’s alright as they die… I cannot leave them alone… I must do something. This time… This time, this time! I will help someone… at least once… I will help someone… for once in my life… And… I will… I will… I will…” He fell asleep.\nHis last [System]-sponsored resort [Calm Walker] failed to counterbalance his emotional swings.\nThe next day, Thorne, Lumi, and Elara finally reunited with him after they parted temporarily to fulfill the starting steps of the King’s demands for them. It could be considered very direct and inefficient, but it was due to Matthew’s unique relationship with him.\nMatthew’s form was elegant and precise, holding his sword with him.\nElara grabbed Matthew’s hand, and they went onward, followed by Lumi and Thorne.\nThis was a journey they would never forget.\nThey raided a goblin camp.\nMatthew was hysterically laughing, as he aimed his rage stemming from insecurity, shame, and guilt upon them. “No more! No more! No more!”\nHe crushed them.\nElara climbed up like a bat and flew, burning houses upon houses. They conquered this spot.\nLumi used her artifacts and blasted artillery strikes upon the goblins, destroying them with clumps of energized magical energy that was now fading beside goblin remains.\nThorne cast lightning, controlling the movements of the goblins and limited their sphere of control until it became as small as a pinpoint. At that point, Matthew’s swinging anger made contact with them at their tightest, ruining, throttling, bursting them off, casting them aside, throwing them upside-down, sharing them upon each other. He wanted to see them whine.\nThis was the domination of the Heavenguard Group, a group of notorious adventurers known for looting and razing goblin villages.\nMatthew opened his hand.\nGoblin children ran off, scared by Matthew’s domineering posture.\nMatthew, the weakling, was now incarnated as a glory-figure—the idea that God incarnated himself in man.\nHe ran, bursting through the village, creating an arc of glory and redemption. He redeemed himself and his sins through the baptism of fire. He had burned himself through the pain and torture of living only to find himself at the feet of His Own feet. He was too sure of himself to find himself at a loss.\nHe couldn’t lose himself, but he was giggling, running around the village and catching the remaining goblins as their gaits paused midway. Taken away, their bodies were dropped and crushed to a million pieces before being restored as a defiled sentiment upon the earth.\nHe removed them again and again.\nHe didn’t need to raid the village.\nThey automatically fell apart before him.\nThe goblins screamed in pain, as the few of them grabbed their inventive devices and aimed at him, shooting him, hoping to bring down the Beast.\nHe grinned, raging upon the streets of Zaun.\nHe laughed and leapt toward them, grabbing them, soaking up so much damage. His health stat was too high.\nThe few goblins’ devices, when against Matthew, lacked efficacy.\nMatthew closed his eyes and the village was finished.\nHis shadow grew and stretched beyond this village, overshadowing the whole region.\nGoblin crowds formed as they pointed in his direction. They could see him through the orbs that showed his location throughout the goblin territories.\n“Witchman! Beast! Monster!” they screamed.\nHe roared upon this new region of authority.\nGoblins found themselves gathered at the meeting tables. One of them, a tall goblin wearing a robe and a helmet that covered his entire head save for two slits for his eyes, Ravitti, said, “I know just the right person.”\nThe goblin hero, Shalle, stood, aiming his hammer at Matthew. “We can’t have you running the area anymore. This is unfair. You can’t be let loose like this… Witchman!”\nWitchman walked on tiptoe, dancing upon the surface of this world and flying across the horizon. He slashed Shalle, as the battle waged as if across generations.\nShalle was a young man, and he had seen so many people throughout his years. He hadn’t seen something like this. But he had spent all his years hoping and training.\nHe had to be careful and trust in his intuition.\nHe smacked Matthew aside and into the distance.\n“Okay… calm down,” Shalle said to himself. “Don’t get confident now.” He prepared for another precise attack.\nMatthew flashed forward, his ghost sword seamlessly transitioning between primed and destroying.\nShalle felt his body deteriorate, but he held his will, smacking Matthew out of the way again. This was the second time.\nThe third time would become a charm.\nMatthew zoomed forward again, changing two steps and making his pattern unpredictable.\nShalle swung for the final time–hundreds of goblins cheering for him right now. He was King of All Kings at this moment for the sake of it.\nMatthew grabbed his hammer, laughing hysterically before he suddenly flew far away.\nShalle widened his eyes in terror. He thought he saw death. He felt his heart beating too fast, as he lay down, having a heart attack. “What is happening to me…” he said. “Oh no… I sacrificied it, I sacrificed it.” He lost his life out of shock.\nMatthew fell to the ground, his body healing gradually. But he was disabled for the time.\nHe closed his eyes, benumbed.\nEarlier, Shalle knew that he could die, but he still did it because he believed in the good his people could do as long as they were given a chance. Now that Matthew was dead, he could relax.\nMatthew was not dead, however, contradicting what he believed.\nHe stood up, embracing the glory.\nHe laughed once again, accompanied by the goblin-hating Thorne, Lumi, and Elara.\nTheir hate group finally reached international strength, identified as small babies in a small pond creating a mess. It was tiny, but it sparked discussions around the changing dynamics in small ponds.\nMatthew curled his fingers and raised his hand palm-up as if demanding a goblin’s death before him.\nHe hated goblins.\n“I must become hatred in order to become goodness.”\nHe embraced a goblin body by slashing it to pieces.\nThis was love when it was most revolting.\n“Beauty!”\nThen, Matthew looked around. He was all alone. After fighting a war, he was not congratulated by people on the way home.\nNo one was celebrating with him. Even if he fought for his country, no one would care. They would only see the angry former soldier that killed people and was cranky all the time when ordering food.\nThat was what he was.\nHe realized that the world was too vast for him to be the center of the story.\nHe lay down.\nMaybe, all this hatred was perfomative just to get attention. Maybe all he wanted was to be perfect, but reality showed him the opposite every time.\nFeeling tense and impatient, he stood up.\nHe did something horrible with unchecked power.\nHe just did it.\nHe lay down again.\nHe was not a hero.\nHe decided to give this all up. This was just a big mistake.\n“Hundreds dead.”\n“I killed hundreds.”\nHe wanted to return to Earth.\nHe was hoping people would congratulate him by the time he was done. He could return to Emerald Heaven and then hopefully win the approval of all the people he had met during his journey in this world, but that wasn’t the case. People had forgot about him, and he had forgot about them.\nHe lived in a world where people lived their own lives.\nThe world didn’t revolve around him.\nEven if he was 26, he still acted like a child who annoyed people and tried to be cool just to get attention, and this world inserted that idea in him because adventurers didn’t feel like soldiers back on Earth. They were like vigilantes who didn’t fight in a war and ruin lives. But no, the concept of vigilantism was similar to the concept of lynching—both relied on unchecked power. Both relied only relied on the permission of the person conducting it instead of an external party like the law and the government. Saying that killing through vigilantism and lynching was okay because it was better than what the government did in wars was very, very dangerous, because false accusations, misunderstandings, and political violence went a long way. It was better to have a system marked by due process in place than to rely on summary executions. Killing someone because they looked at one funny was just plainly unsustainable.\nHe was just a normal person in the end.\nIf people like him actually got approval, then where were the top adventurers? They were all branded as monsters too disgusting to mention because their power was too great and they abused it. That was why he would never get approval really, because he was only fodder.\nHe would be an entitled teenager to believe that he deserved anything beyond normalcy.\nIf he dared seek superiority, he would first have to be humble and accept that he was a human being, because being able to identify one’s limitations was pivotal to their solutions.\nThese were fundamental aspects of maturity.\nEven if he had been consistently rested on these principles back on Earth, this new world broke him out of balance immensely. 7 months wasn’t enough to cleanse him of his sins and of the smell this earth reeked of. It morally ruined him to see conflicts happen without people discussing about it as a cultural issue. Instead, in this world, people did things without a word, whether it be killing a village of goblins or leaving them in agony with traps.\nThis was not a cultural controversy. It was a cultural norm transcending boundaries within this large region. It reminded him of how culturally normal slavery at its arguable prime used to be back on Earth. This made him realize that based on what he had done until now, he would be one of those people who sat by and did nothing while people committed abuse and atrocities because of peer pressure and fear of being ostracized, outed, shamed, and excommunicated as an outcast. To be more accurate, he was actively committing atrocities alongside his fellow adventurers against the metaphorical Poles particularly thanks to this one magic word–“camaraderie.” The shared bonds and shared emotional debt and gratitude he had with adventurers made it very difficult for him not to do what they did so casually and confidently. It was like a child being taught to trade bonds at birth. It was natural like sliced buttered toast every morning for him back on Earth.\nIt could be compared to mob behavior or mentality, but in a more insidious, long-term, more ingraining, scarring, permanent scope, because it involved friendships between ride-or-die companions, given their line of work as adventurers actively fighting monsters in life-or-death situations.\nGoblins were humanoids fair and square, which meant that they could be compared to a more human version of monkeys due to their ability to use tools and create tents and buildings within caves. They could also speak well with humans in the same language.\nThey were humans in smaller green bodies like children.\nMatthew was killing children.\nMaybe, that was a stretch.\nBut he was trembling right now as he thought that, because he had been particularly afraid of hurting Drakekiller’s young daughter due to killing so many goblins, who were child-sized.\nIt was also video games that contributed largely to this idea that goblins were monsters and adventurers were good guys.\nHe was already lying down, but he sat up. Earlier, he told Thorne, Lumi, and Elara that he would be staying here while they looted the village.\nThey were back now, staring at him.\n“You okay?” said Elara.\nMatthew nodded. He wasn’t able to finish his thoughts, but maybe now was a good time to leave. He got up and followed them to leave.\nHe really didn’t want to be a moralist. He hated politics. He wasn’t going to tell them anything, but it was eating him inside and would ruin him emotionally and mentally for as long as he lived unless he said something about it and vented. And even then, calming his soul would involve actually making real effort toward promoting ideas that aligned with his sanity.\nIf only he was a psychopath… this would be much, much easier.\nKnowing what he wanted based on his demeanor and history, the [System] appeared in front of him. “Do you want to have these emotions permanently removed? We can make you free. That would make you incredibly powerful to do what you believe is right.”\nMatthew nodded, embracing the [System]’s feet, tears dripping down onto them.\nThe [System] grinned devilishly, as magical particles swirled around Matthew, removing that cognitive dissonance within him and making him truly perfect.\nHe gained a new title from the Overlord who handed him the title [Overlord’s Gifted] before.\n[Hollowed Heart] increases all divine attributes by 25% when in any state marked by grandiose delusions.\n“Why the Overlord again?” Matthew said.\n“The Overlord maketh rich,” the [System] said, “and he addeth no sorrow to it.”\n“What does the title really mean?”\n“It means whatever you think it means.”\nEventually, many events went by in a flash.\nFirst, he began swinging a hammer, forging a goblin by the head on the anvil. He gained buffs for doing this, even if it was very crude. It was incredibly ritualistic, magical, full of faith and belief, and carrying a sense of divinity, resulting in its unique success.\n[Goblin Slayer] title has been upgraded to [Goblin Deteriorator]!\n[Goblin Deteriorator] increases all damage dealt to the goblin species by 25% when the target is in a state of panic.\n“You shall become the Hammer, and I, the Wielder.”\nSecond, he prayed to himself and found himself staring at himself through a surreal dreamscape.\nThird, when the [System] asked him about the gods once, he said: “I have no ill will against the gods; in fact, I’d rather they didn’t care about me.\n“I’m already too much to handle. How much more gods of supreme power? I am a pin in a haystack, not because I’m hard to find, but because I am insignificant in a haystack of grand schemes and entities beyond my current comprehension.”\nFourth, when Matthew reunited with Deathbringer with a newfound direction in his life, he said: “Are you going to be useful to me?”\n“What?” Deathbringer said. “What are you on about?”\n“Are you going to be useful to me?”\nMatthew paused.\nHe continued: “I apologize. Might you please collaborate with me?”\n“Sure—”\n“If so, how might you and I collaborate?”\nIf he wasn’t useful, Matthew would bring him to the hammer with the intention of restoring him in a glorious new world of experience and journey.\nEven if Matthew lost his emotions, he never lost the sense of divinity.\nTo finish, [Hollowed Heart] was changing everything fast. Matthew was right to change things and make things better to remove the cognitive dissonance between a broken displaced man and a powerful intellectual creature. And [Hollowed Heart] was cancelling out the former. But whatever happened from now on was out of any outsider’s hands, except for the gods maybe.\nChapter 59 - Weaving the Web of Influence linkMatthew was all alone in a vast landscape, and he walked around again and again.\nHe grabbed several goblins he knew and began arranging them together, placing them inside a cave where he tasked them to check around and provide vision and control of it.\nHe visited several adventurers and invited them to take a quest that placed them around several key dungeons, establishing control and vision.\nHe met a particular giant crocodile driver and told him that he wanted to hire him for a job. He had him take on the role of assessing giant crocodiles that the adventurer guild bought for him and had adventurers ride them to different parts of the local region.\nHe needed loyalty most of all before skill. This way, he could prevent an unwanted forced transfer of power.\nHe arranged groups of adventurers and guided them to tanners and various craftsmen in order to establish connections that would be useful later on. He needed them on the same side, so he arranged discussions and meetings that saw both sides creating bonds. He then strengthened their bonds by convincing the guild overseeing these craftsmen to work closer with the adventurer guild in a coalition.\nThis was why he was moving chess pieces around, because he had a large plan in mind.\nBut he needed to keep his vision peeled, because vision and control was beginning to accumulate overtime.\nHe watched the landscape again, seeing different parts of combine and integrate together. The roads that used to be disconnected were now interconnected.\nHe found himself at a crossroads, but he knew where to go. And he had the plans to achieve his next greater objectives.\nHe completely eliminated any need for neutralizing goblins by first having his most loyal adventurers hear of his plan to elevate goblins’ responsibilities to those requiring some form of education. His quest [Bridge of Knowledge] had become active anymore all of a sudden, but that didn’t matter.\nHe put two and two together and started the first embers of goblin-humanity communications.\nHe sat down and found himself staring at the older man again, but this time, the older man being sent to another prison, as the city’s planning and infrastructure improved and changed to support new work and opportunity.\nMatthew sat down next to a small branch, as he sent adjutants to various locations to complete tasks that he didn’t need to complete himself. He became a spider with a web, putting together various people and having them work together gradually. The loyalty of the selected people was essential to this process.\nHe didn’t need to go outside, as the region was growing clearer and clearer without the tunnel vision enforced upon him by being present there in the moment. Being an overseeing eye by staying inside and staring at a map allowed him to consolidate and apply his knowledge in a more streamlined manner. Even if it was simplistic, models too complex couldn’t be too generally applicable. He maintained a systematic attitude throughout the whole process.\nHowever, in times where his strategist role became of use, he was there, adding his name to arrangements proposed by other adventurers. He became a popular name to put on quests to invite adventurer interest.\nAs time passed, he demanded more and more from his people, resulting in more delegation. Deathbringer was no longer a leader; he was reduced to a man in a machine. But that was alright for him. He began connecting his friends to Matthew without taking away their dignity.\nMatthew showed himself glad to receive their partnership for upcoming missions that might require their assistance. He used friendly and agency-giving terms instead of more mechanical ones like “outsourcing” to give a sense of togetherness in the issues concerning the region.\nHe became a network, one that contrasts the government due its small size and reliance on namesakes after him.\nIn the meantime, two of his closest adventurer friends, Tamer and Michel, got the opportunity to glimpse at him.\nAll the memories drifted away like the last smoke of a put-out, jaded campfire at the beginning of a new morn.\nEventually, they found an opportunity to make Matthew enter a dungeon himself, emphasizing the need of the adventurers taking on the quest to see him.\nHis form was elegant like a majestic bird that had flown far above them, not a single raindrop falling down because he experienced no regrets and had reached Heaven.\nTamer followed him, watching his footsteps. They were bold, unyielding, and uncharacteristically zoned out, as if he was there for the continued functioning of his body and not necessarily for the beauty of the moment. She looked at Michel, who nodded.\nMichel went shoulder-to-shouldre with Matthew and asked, “Matthew?”\nMatthew turned his head robotically. “What is it?” he said. “Are the adventurers expecting him earlier?”\nMichel shook her head, unable to find herself responding due to how serious Matthew had sounded.\nMatthew continued, “Then, let’s move on.”\nMichel’s hope to turn Matthew’s gaze at the world fell apart.\nTamer wanted him to come back and try to stop it all. He didn’t need to do this. He could live normally. He was right to leave, and he was wrong to come back to Emerald Haven. Sure, it was nice to see him, but they just wanted him to be okay. But professionally, he was incomparable.\nMatthew raised his hands and had a speech: “Look, everyone, I understand that all of you are struggling with your struggles, like everyone else does. It’s normal to feel scared, to feel like it doesn’t make sense. But I am in 100% sureness that you guys can do it. Just be patient, take your time, and read the notes that I had Solevuk sent you. If you’re not willing to do that, then you can also focus on training your legs, specifically your calves. It can be difficult, and I’ve seen the mistakes, particularly the one where you guys forget to put wards and save them in case. But that’s not feasible. It would be more productive to have them placed immediately, even if you might bleeding on them sooner or later. Their effectiveness will be cut short if you die while hiding them… in a pocket or somewhere else.” This speech was focused on cleaning up a little, the actual advice he gave secondary in importance and more of a front than anything.\nThe adventurers moved on with his lead, heading from dungeon to dungeon. The clearing was quick, but the monsters were sometimes nasty. In the end, Matthew easily found a way to solve the issue without conducting too much strategical thought. He could solve the troubles therein by exploiting simplistic monster groupthink.\nIt was when he wasn’t strategizing that he knew he had reached the point where things were happening smoothly and where he didn’t have to improvise as much due to his growing system of influence, connections, knowledge, and comprehensiveness of experience.\nBecause he finally proved capable of mustering a coalition over a wide but disconnected portion of the local region, he was being sent to fight in larger, deeper floors of dungeons where stronger enemies resided. He was still in the lowest rank Iron, so it would take some time before he moved to boss monsters and ascended to Bronze.\nEventually, after engaging in a few coalition-level quests, Matthew was sent to a new group of senior adventurers who accepted him into their group. Furthermore, he was officially being detached from his leader role within the coalition. The goal was for him to begin ascending up the ranks more and testing areas where he needed improvement.\nThey sighted an enemy, making their way around, warding on sides and keeping right and left side free of enemies by maintaining vision and control over the area.\nAlongside a mobile mage and a tank, the diver of the senior adventurer team moved close to several hobgoblins before backing off because they knew that one of the goblins likely hid a strong area-of-effect skill.\nMatthew was playing support role right now, as he was there to learn, carrying a bag of wards that he placed around and run around with the team’s speed-boosting artifact. When he was poked with magical attacks, he used [Phantom Shield]. The hobgoblins he passed didn’t want to force an engage at him, because their info told them that Matthew had powerful area-of-effect abilities. However, that was no longer true.\nThe adventurer team was able to force an engage, crushing them and chasing the retreating hobgoblins.\nMatthew was just taking in XP as a member of this team. He didn’t need to kill a hobgoblin to gain experience, as the party was signed with a contract that shared XP.\nHe was sent to a new part of the city; one with a lot more empty space. And it was harder to get into the streets that he used to travel before. He would be made to ride a giant crocodile every time he went outside. This made him more like a noble, but that was because of the adventurer-centric system of this city.\nAfter relaxing for a while, he was sent to the senior adventurer guild to do some paperwork now that he was confirmed capable of handling a dungeon raid at their level. Though, it felt like a formality, given that he didn’t need to expend too much effort.\nAfter doing this, he visited several people, including a familiar umbrella-maker, whom he showed his umbrella.\nHe did this to find loyalty among the masses, and past connections and acquaintances from a long time ago were priceless.\nHe had them put together as part of a outing, establishing them as a more permanent aspect of himself.\nHe visited a dungeon where he lost once again the giant ants, bringing Zoey with him. He noticed various vulnerabilities that could be exploited if a fight were to occur here and he was on the defender’s side with the enemy being the invaders outside the dungeon. He wanted to create a place where the goblins could stay here, and he intended to gather monsters and have Tamer and other fellow tamers turn them into friendlies. He soon directed the creation of a zoo here.\nHe visited three controlled dungeons where he began bringing blue goblins into the zoo to test things out.\nAfter refining the zoo while inspecting the blue goblins as well, he informed Zoey about it more and more with the goal of having her [Master of the Basics] role be a lot more sophisticated. If he could get her to understand this, then having someone tailored to the role of managing this would be good.\nHe was earning more money than he had ever earned before, and even if he was no longer officially a coalition leader, he still had the influence of one.\nHe check out various spots that he recalled—including the golem-maker’s goblin ambush location, the blades’ headquarters, Block \u0026 Bed Tavern, his first dungeon steps, the tanner’s workshop at the City of Power, the guild there, and the shelter, Greenfield, the beginner adventurer areas, and the coastal area.\nEven with growing connectivity, he still maintained his loyalty to these locations, allowing him to visualize a way for events to transpire with him quickly on board.\n+10 XP for enhancing your cognitive abilities by 1%!\nChapter 60 - Hollowed Heart: Managing the New Era linkMatthew stared at the silence, not a single emotion-inspired thought growing in his mind, the ideas flowing like river streams shallow enough to wade through but cold and wet enough to warrant a changing.\nIt was emotion that had left him.\nSo he sat there like a man without breath or soul. The lacking nature of his reclusiveness into pragmatism was something he pondered.\nWith strategy came the necessity to wonder and think up creative and innovative means of dismantling and defeating an opponent, and that tended to encompass the reflection of past events and naturally, the self that witnessed these events limitedly.\nSo even with the emotions that the [System] removed from him, he experienced self-awareness and the recognition of this loss and what that meant moving forward.\nHe allied himself with the thoughts that pierced through the veil of confusion, stepping up heel by heel, leg by leg, and body by body.\nThe forces that amassed under him were complex in formation; now, all he had to do was reuse them again and again until their minds were streamlined like his was. This way, he could focus their efforts toward better goals.\nThough, it was not a problem of consistency or the time he spent reflecting upon this clear need.\nIt was just that today was an optimal day to rest and reinforce previous patterns in the realm of learning.\nStress was something even psychopaths underwent.\nShifting to a goal-oriented level, he raised a goblin farm, putting together a group of studious adventurers to study the blue goblins and the new green goblins he had placed in a separate enclosure. To conclude, his novel pursuit was to bring light into the nutritional strategy and social environment of the goblin species, but more than that, in simple terms, he wanted to find out how to beat them and every other monster, including humans who had found out how to turn themselves metaphorically into monsters via the [System], skills, spells, levels, items, and artifacts. He was investing into creating a controlled region where everything would be simply reported, referenced, and managed.\nBut that was already underway, Desmond Leroy coming in clutch, among many other individuals reporting direclty alongside him and under him.\nHe had won, but at what cost?\nHowever, even if he emphasized his ownership over this big idea that he had, he was only a mere bread-holder, someone who contributed as a part of a large whole filled with other contributors like him.\nHe knew that there was no turning back from this point.\nHe had to go all the way and throw everything into this new era.\nA fortunate thing was that he wasn’t limited to higher-order activities due to the authorities’ decision to promote him to a higher rank where the playing ground was more immediate and face-to-face with monsters that could match him in a fist fight.\nWhen it came to ranks, though Sophia had been rank 660 at one point, she wasn’t exactly strong. The ranks were very top-heavy, so anybody past rank 100 was incredibly powerful relative to those above rank 100. And ranking up could be done by relying exclusively on a singular approach—a one-trick pony—which didn’t exactly translate to actual on-site combat competence.\nSo he was being placed among the higher ranks, which was why he was a part of an “official” group now unlike before, one whose members were broadcasted at the board in the adventerer guild, including him. He was now officially an “Adventurer.”\nIn other words, he was a pro, and his debut quest was coming soon.\nFor now, he would be taking his time exploring the new advantages provided and the environment he was now situated in.\nThe [System] appeared to him, and they began a discussion.\n[System] said: “How do you suppose you’ll be managing that?”\nMatthew said: “I don’t know, have you seen the daylights ringing? I’m not exactly the first one who’s tried that.\n“Well I don’t know. It really seems as if you’re the one pulling the strings. Remember Desmond. He doesn’t seem too adamant about it, but he’s been the one letting you take the reins. I’m not saying you’re leader-leader. I’m just saying that if Desmond really was the one at the steering wheel, he’d be the one commanding you.”\nMatthew frowned, squinted, and shook his head. “Look I get it. But at the same time, right now is kind of a precious time. If we start slacking and start doing all this mental gymnastics all over the people we should be relying on, things’ll be difficult. I don’t want to have another repeat of those previous exits. I am not willing to do that. Don’t insert doubt in me. I don’t need to pay that sentiment any kind of attention, okay? So just listen to me. We have to finish up a little on the corner here and there, and I’ll be managing the finances and taking care of some of the people involved in the zoo project. If they think it’s a good idea, we can proceed with it. The blue goblins aren’t going anywhere, and the adventurers who manage them are also on my side. I’ve given them what they need. I’ve told them my goals, and all I really need is to make sure their signatures are lined up pretty nicely on that contract. We’ve already got seven of them signed. Only two more to go. But that’s besides the point. With the blue goblins already in the bag, I’m going to be arranging the different elements of the table, putting together lists of places. And you’ll pretty much see it all laid down visually. I’ve gathered the information-organizing resources. Zoey doesn’t know much about it, but she said she’s in contact with the scribes I used to work with. So it’s a definite that we’ll begin erasing and making changes and revising things. The whole plan will be much more better than those scribbles I made earlier. Hopefully, this works. I haven’t been here for too long, and I already know we’re going to be heading down a painful path.”\n“That’s right. But do be careful. You’re going to be dealing with Mischanti and Kariyosa, too definitely nasty fellows you want to avoid. They’re not exactly mean or dangerous, but they do waste time. They don’t really know what else to do but relax, and they’ve been ordering up various goblins from across the land just to have intercourse with. They’re really not your forte, I’m telling you. I even heard that one of the adventurers you’re currently working with has been involved with abuse with his spouse. I don’t want to act like this is some easy quest. You’re going to be dealing with a whole lot of losers and winners. They’re a mix of both, full of themselves and yet unable to truly reach divinity, if you know what I mean. We’re going to want you to follow up with us by first taking care of one of the female adventurers with you. She’ll be sharing information, and she’s not exactly dying or anything. She’ll be needing your attention for a new quest, and she hopes to get newbies. It has taken 3 years for her, since there’s practically no people coming over to the higher ranks. You’re her beacon of hope. Help her. She hasn’t been able to level up much, since her level is too high. She is serious about getting promoted, but because she hasn’t been able to check off this one requirement, they haven’t given her the time. And it’s been a 3 years, like I said.”\nMatthew nodded. “What can we do? Some of our forces are already moving west, south, and they’ve made contact with the goblin tribes and groups. I don’t want to have to break open another cannister of worms here. If we’re balling, we’re balling. But I haven’t exactly determined whether this’ll be the right decision to make given the current deal with Sophia’s friends. They’ve been against our rallying and unifying since five days ago, and Deathbringer is suddenly convinced he didn’t really need to be there in Sumpera.” For context, “Sumpera” was the place of one of the quests they took several days ago. They had taken many quests during the time Matthew progressed to his current status. “I haven’t delegated Marcher’s friend yet. But since he has the bazaar under his fingers, being the owner—I really want to have him organize the boys that we got delivered from Los Bin.” For context, the boys he was referring to were the goblin friends sent by the goblin tournament-taking companions currently under his leadership. “Also, yesterday, if we hadn’t led with that first, it would have been a total loss.” To give context, he was referring to the boat method belonging to the 100-man adventurer team that were now part of a larger structure under his control. “Even now, it’s still functioning well.”\nThe [System] showed his true colors. “Honestly, fuck the forces for now. Focus on gathering your strength. It’s better to leave them in check-and-see duty first. If we haven’t spent enough time gathering the Sumpera loot yet, then we can also move some of them there.”\n“Alright.”\nMatthew’s relationship with the [System] had improved since he was given the title [Hollowed Heart].\nMatthew reached his current board of advisors and made sure to keep his mouth shut until he could get his thoughts in order. When it came to the [System], he went full-force with details and tracing certain plans and ideas because the [System] was a personal assistant to him at this point. But when it came to the board, he was very careful about what he said because if it was revealed that he was hiding things from them, then they could easily demand his removal. The reason he reached this point in the first place was because of his ascension through the ranks, and since no one had reached his level of influence, they had him take on bigger roles until his friends transitioned to that of a more formal structure with oversight from the authorities of course.\nBut with all his planning, he knew when to strike the wound deep and when to adjust for a better angle of attack. This was why even now, he could transfer his cognition between physical combat and strategic dialogue.\nLater, instead of the planned meeting with Deathbringer, Michel’s friends came instead.\nOne of them informed Matthew: “Tamer has been busy recently with the aftershocks with the earthquake at Threadnaut Hill.\nMatthew replied: “If she’s the one being made to advance the new birdmonsters, then that’s good too.”\nThat was it. That was the end of the meeting. They really had little to share since they were still testing the waters and avoiding any chance the other party could call offence or imbalance of power. Magic made things very dangerous in terms of how information was spread, because spells like changing voice existed. If two parties could converse easily without magic being a potential threat to integrity and honesty, then care still had to be prioritized when encountering new communication structures, that which Michel’s friends and Matthew, as two novel interlocutors, brought to the table.\nChapter 61 - The Pursuit of Perfection linkMatthew put together hundreds of men and assembled them with armor, tools, unique artifacts, and goals in mind. The point was to make sure that everything around him could find rest in the seat of power in their own way. He rewarded them with power by enabling a culture of camaraderie, one already supported by adventurism. He just made it many more times efficient at that job by making it easier for New Adventurers. Truly, he worked with Desmond to help New Adventurers, making sure he appeared to motivate the new entrants.\nAnd for the senior adventurers, he kept his head low, but he did make sure that even now, they were being treated with new stuff.\nMatthew appeared before them.\nIn the eyes of his compatriots, they saw the grace of the Lord in that form, a form glazing with glory. He moved with purpose, demanding things from them, and they obeyed because they had seen his mighty works. He was slow to anger, and great in power, and would not at all acquit the wicked: he had his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds were the dust of his feet. Great was he, and greatly to be praised in the city of their God, in the mountain of his holiness. Forasmuch as there was none like unto him.\nThe compatriots, the soldiers of righteousness, ran about, committing great acts of justice by turning the goblins into men of their alliance and destroying monsters. They were wary of dogs, wary of evil workers, and wary of mutilators of the flesh.\nFor dogs had encompassed them: the assembly of the wicked had inclosed them: they pierced their hands and their feet. The soldiers of righteousness might tell their bones: the wicked looked and stared upon them. They part their garments among them, and cast lots upon their vesture.\nBut the wicked would perish: Though Matthew’s enemies were like the flowers of the field, they would be consumed, they would go up in smoke.\nMatthew stood in front of his compatriots, and he dragged along his arms when he moved among them. The greatness that he had hidden belonged to them also.\nThe work that he had done when he was still creating this persona and enigma before he cast out his emotions had a great impact now that it was supplemented by actual competence.\nMatthew, or Witchman, began his march toward creating oblivion.\nHis rise to power set off alarm bells.\nFirst, the giant spiders ran about, checking their fellows and contacting their communities, Matthew’s shadow stretching across their dungeons.\nSecond, the giant ants began conversing with each other and with their leader who had guided them into human land, a looming threat in the distance shaped like Matthew.\nThird, goblin tribes sent messengers to each other to inform them of the coming Witchman.\nFourth, Mawkery had claimed a powerful space-controlling skill and similarly powerful artifacts, hoping to meet this Witchman.\nFifth, Grimtusk, who had been able to escape from the adventurers, was now in hiding, worried that Matthew, who begun the coalition against him before, would come for him first. He hid in a cave like a fugitive.\nShifting to an exploration of each party, a giant spider, Razuki, was handling crates and putting together various items that they had taken from a village raid into their compartments, having created various room-shaped webs to help separate their things. They used the fact that they could climb and had the rooms be located anywhere in the walls; they collaborated with the giant molerats to make sure that they could dig the rooms easily.\nRazuki signalled another sub-group of giant spiders, Losanta, Broklato, Santala, and Apaz, to begin creating arrangements here and there, which meant selecting a list of spiders to handle the potential threat of Matthew forces checking out their spot from the vantage point on the surface. They were currently inside a dungeon, but they knew well the strategic points in their environment, having explored around a lot.\nLosanta said, “We haven’t arranged the little things so far. What do you think we should be doing?”\nBroklato said: “That’s surely going to take a while. We can have Apazoto and Ricalufusta have the opportunity to have it slowly progress.”\nApaz said: “I haven’t really taken care of the Machuchu, but there’s been concerns over whether or not they’re a threat. The current limitations are severe, and we wouldn’t have to repeat Lavuske incident.”\nRazuki gave the equivalent of a nod. “Right, we can have the Machuchu just put there over the corner. It should be enough the poison spell to keep them at a distance. Then, we can Fairy do the rest of their work.”\nApaz said, “How about Barkada and Flower Ranger?”\nRazuki continued: “There’s been loose stands between both parties involved. We can have Zamboanga loosen up the caroto-bangs.”\nEach species had their own items of concern, including Machuchu, Lavuske incident, Barkada, Flower Ranger, and caroto-bangs. Moreover, Zamboanga, Fairy, Apazoto and Ricalufusta were code names of units.\nReturning to Matthew on an intellectual perspective, he knew he was very limited, even if he had reached this point. He only knew as much as a young master knew about the plights of the plebeians. He was limited to his experience of life as one who had come from Earth, but he was also enabled by it. It allowed him to reach heights, even if inevitably, he didn’t actually know that much. He might have been powerful in several prongs of operation- and organization-order combat competencies. But besides that, he was a fitted tool on an already perfect hand or a fitted boot on an already perfect foot. Without the environment, society, and system that enabled him to pursue this singular goal of perfection, both in the realm of persona and actual profiency, he would be a drifting, broken man, and there had been hundreds of people like him, talented and hard-working, but they didn’t succeed. Why? Because they weren’t in the right place at the right time. Even if they would take the opportunity once it presented itself, they were given lesser opportunities and lesser chances at success. This was what Matthew was. He was a representation of what would happen if the right people were given the right tools, or maybe in this case, if the wrong people were given the best tools, considering how dangerous and volatile Matthew had been as someone given chances upon chances and power to reflect upon his success enough that he could do it all over again in progressively increasing degrees. People like Matthew exist all around the world, and it was their job to live the lives that many people sought. He drained his dreams, hopes, ideas, and personality into this one pursuit, becoming the epitome of grace and beauty—their every want and need coalesced.\nHe was the fantasy that people wanted, but inside, he was dying to become human again. But that was no longer the case, especially with [Hollowed Heart]. The [System] had made it very clear that Matthew could be this Idea. But that would take a lot of fine-tuning, which was why it was a patient process, one marked by confusion, disjointedness, and a sense of awe and wonder at the seeming suddenness in which pivotal events came about; comparable to a dove being struck by spears of God at a time when all plants were supposed to fly with wings. Indeed, that metaphor alone expressed how unyieldingly complicated his life was and, to that extent, he was. He could only march a long path along a narrow road, which grew narrower and narrower as his options dissipated, and the only answer left was to live a life, one that wasn’t his own.\nBut he had accepted it now. He was becoming this Person, this Personhood, this Epitome.\nIn this manner, he was a science project of a juvenile mind—[The System].\nEven with this, he could only sit down and appreciate the night sky, not in a manner given to Emotion, but one given to the glory of patience and cognitive similarization. He knew the patterns that struck each other like hammers at the forge. He knew the details that colluded within a cabal. He knew the marching agents that all abided by his rule as a young master. He knew just how well he spoke when the time came.\nHe was irrationally beautiful, a product of nature and nurture; time had spoken again and again that humans were capable of great acts of violence, whether or not they protested against its essence of meaning.\nThis was Matthew at his best; a complete evolution toward utter disdain, not anger or emotional rage but a pragmatism so volatile in its decision-making due to its nature as an exception from all the other societal members that projected emotion-driven acts.\nThis was Matthew, the epitome of grace and beauty, the idealism.\nMoving into a potential future, it saw Matthew very differently. In this vision, he shocked the world by falling apart; as soon as his units reached a sense of highest might, they broke apart like a metal line between two towers. It soon faded into obscurity, along with the concept of Matthew as this essential Thing.\nHe fell to the ground, hugging the earth, crawling upon its interstices, hoping to drain into them the pragmatism that knew only what it had gained and not what it had lost—emotion, drive, and the ability to take oneself and recognize the beauty of life within its appreciative cognition, that often attributed to “psychology” when, without the traditional demarcation between psychology and cognition, it was an essential constituent of this brain that made humans human.\nIn this reality, this world that he had built through pragmatism soon faded, because what pragmatism asked for were the ability to navigate a world full of fluctuations and learning that the most optimal solutions often involved dissolution, resetting, and starting over with a new stratum of refinement. Emotion wouldn’t have saved it, but it would have made the experience of having built it much more tangibly felt. Emotion was sight to the humans all around, analogous to actual sight. Pragmatism had only shown him that the path to success was marked by humanity, because to be superior above other humans was to recognize the weight they held as people. Ignorant superiority was dependent upon a superficial and unsustainable idea of success, one not grounded in reality (and by extension, pragmatism), as the very idea of success was dictated by human beings. In other words, success could not be divorced from its social and human context, because the desire to succeed was inevitably human, epitomized by the emotions that drove individuals to ambition and feats beyond any common man would achieve on their own, coupled with the pragmatism merely equipped (as a tool) to achieve that. Furthermore, notions that living a life wholly rational to succeed didn’t take into account that the desire to succeed was intertwined with emotional processes.\nGod might have blessed his pursuit, but Matthew himself had abandoned the righteousness inherent in internal (emotional) integrity.\nHe had forced himself into a brick wall basically, hoping that he could become this Ideal without the sense organ that saw the hard and emotional societal factors necessary for its emergence and stability. The conceptual understanding of emotions wasn’t sufficient to access the wealth of emotion-tinged memories that made him the larger-than-life person he had become. Emotional understanding necessitated feeling on the understander’s part—also known as empathy—and the loss of this was what led to his downfall.\nHe couldn’t see people, and that made him a bad guide, immediately depleting the spike of short-lived resources gained from pragmatism and exhausting the lasting resources he had gained as an emotional man.\nPeople wanted to believe in something, and if the leader themselves didn’t feel so irrational in believing that very thing with all the emotions that it entailed, then they would depart, realizing that they needed someone even more irrational, even more disillusioned, and even more reckless and uncompromising, not someone only given to solutions that had already worked and working within a stable limit. Sometimes, bursts of emotion left people in awe, like a populist declaring the charisma of genuine outrage at a speech podium. It was irrational yes, but it was very real. And if irrational things dictated rational results, then wouldn’t that be considered rational as well?\nThese were the hypothesis and conclusions Matthew made; though, much of it leaned toward his subjective understanding of the matter.\nZooming in to the present moment, Matthew stared at the sun, asking the wind for a sign. He was determined to remove himself from this world temporarily until he resolved the issue with the [System], who neglected to answer him.\n“When are you coming back?” he said.\nSilence greeted him, saying hi.\nHe worded his thoughts in an absentminded, meditative way.\nSilence sat down beside him, asking for a foot rest. She placed her leg on his lap, using the back of a wooden wall as support for her neck and back.\nMatthew frowned, trying to return some emotions that he had lost. But he wasn’t truly frowning, and he wasn’t sad.\nSilence took a deep breath, asking him if he had seen anyone around here.\nMatthew shook his head.\n“There’s no one around him,” he said simply, referring to himself in third person.\nSilence watched him try to make expressions, ultimately laughing at him and saying that it was okay to learn.\nHe would have widened his eyes with shock if he felt something. But he dispassionately knew that he was learning again to feel and process things emotionally.\nBecoming purely rational had left him in paused time, because those emotional past events and details weren’t going to process themselves.\nSilence left, as the [System] appeared.\n“Hi,” he said.\nChapter 62 - The Hollowed Crusade: Matthew’s Descent into Moral Invalidation linkMatthew plunged his arm against a quiet throat, making sure that every single ounce of power was delivered in full. This was actual, and this was how rhythmic he was with murder even.\nHe was focused in killing a member of a party of adventurer-bandits who had gotten in his space too hard and began threatening him.\nIn the meantime, the adventurer-bandits saw a rhythmic agent that foresaw their destruction. They ran, fleeing the terror involved with this machination—a machine capable of terrifying acts of brutality despite a past history of weakness and reliance on his connections and ability to navigate them effectively.\nMatthew struck them with a beating, tearing away their emotions. In the process, they physically died.\nEarlier, one bandit tried to stab him in the gut, but Matthew grabbed him and beat him again and again, showing that no matter what happened, he was there.\nThe distractions and hesitations they had were overshadowed by his ruthless quickness toward violence.\nAnother bandit tried to spear him, but Matthew banged his head with a blunt weapon, crushing the skull that knew only fear.\nHe made the man a slave before him and then chained him to everlasting silence—death.\nThe other bandits stood awkwardly and stared in silence.\nMatthew ran at them before sweeping them away from their lives and into darkness; the blood spilling all over the floor clumsily.\nThe bandits flew into heaven’s embrace, their hearts aligned with hope and dreams, never a single thought of ruthless violence having entered their minds. They only stole and never killed, but their actions were still evil. But it was never to the degree that it was unforgivable, because a crucified thief could ask for forgiveness and be saved.\nMatthew had blasphemed the Holy Ghost.\nHe abided in the realm of moral invalidation.\nHe removed the sacred texts after defiling them. He drew on them also.\nHe struck, and he struck, and he struck, making his way into his own embrace—a Godhood created specifically for him, which only he confirmed as valid.\nHe was self-justified and self-rationalized, self-accepting and self-caring.\nHe selfishly defied the gods, making his way down the steps of destruction.\nHe abused the men and made attempts to destroy their souls.\nBut the men had been saved by Grace, a line of scarlet thread in each of their windows.\nMatthew did not roar or bark in indignation. He merely gazed like a beast that even real beasts couldn’t compare.\nHe created creation through his acts, the blood spilling again and again in rhythmic waves.\nDroves of goblins, adventurer-bandits, giant ants, giant spiders, and all sorts of creatures and monster-kin entered into his range, and he spilled again and again until the days were over, not a single day wasted, not a single day inefficient, because he acted with the help of his authority and of his power.\nThe power that he never had as an emotional man.\nThe blood was upon their own heads. He was guiltless.\nHe rubbed his hands with water and soap, but the blood remained, staining them permanently.\nHe walked around, blood on his hands, blood on his clothes, blood on his armor, blood on his weapons, and blood staining his spirit. Abel, where were you?\nWhen humanoid monsters came clumsily like children trying to catch a bird, he struck again and again, beating the piss out of these mule boys.\nAnd the issue was that with these acts of violence, he was fine-tuning his ability to fight suddenly and with abruptness, preparing for attacks similar to the older man who had deprived him of his levels and skills and the disgusting man who had traumatized him.\nHe was working to reduce the chances of those two instances happening ever again. He didn’t want to be left in a pond wading quietly until he drowned.\nHe would cast the bait firsthand. This way, he didn’t let his enemies attack him when he was most unprepared.\nHe struck like a doctor, inserting a sword and spilling floods of blood.\n[Michel’s Ghost Sword] was purposeful in this conquest.\nHe loved the world, and this was his love, his version of appreciation, one marred by the [System]’s antics. It was one big joke! It really was!\nHe had given up his emotions out of love.\nThe [System] chuckled and guffawed all the while.\nMatthew looked at him, almost offended, but he wasn’t and couldn’t feel much, if at all, except for a feeling of ease and smoothness usually unassociated with callused callousness.\nBut the thing was that it didn’t matter whether he killed the goblins with a sword or by commanding one of the adventurers to do it. He didn’t feel self-justified, because he didn’t feel the need to do so.\nHe just was, and he didn’t feel anything about that.\nIt was more so just taking things and going by.\nIt wasn’t relaxation.\nIt wasn’t stress.\nIt was nothingness, something everyone could experience, but while everyone closed their eyes, he couldn’t see.\nAfter killing for a while, he returned to his goblin zoo project and communicated with them as a cat would play with his food.\nHe sat down and relaxed beside them. “How are you guys?” he said casually like one of the youth leaders in a church.\nThe goblins were staring at him, trying not to say a word, but Matthew didn’t look too dangerous, especially with how comfortable and relaxed he was without looking closed and self-satisfied. He looked curious like a child and open to fresh ideas. “What do you want?” one of them said, Grumblegut, sitting behind a cage.\n“I just want to ask whether you guys are going fine. I was hoping you’d answer me because if you’re not, I can have them give you guys more food or more water or more of anything. Just tell me.”\nThe goblins knew that Matthew was the boss, but they were surprised again as if it was the first time they had heard evidence of Matthew’s status.\nOne of them, Snaggletooth said: “Sure, please give us some food, thank you. I want sisig, the one you gave me last time.”\n“Right… one of our cooks can do that, but I’m tired. So I’ll only give you half a plate, because if you guys eat too much, I won’t be there to watch you eat it all. I was hoping to start a streak of watching you guys. I know you guys mind, but do say what you’d prefer?”\n“What do you mean?” said Gristlebelly.\n“What kind of format? Do you want the cage to be here? Do you want the cage to look like this? I’m trying to give you options. If you guys feel too discontent, then this’ll be difficult. I was hoping to help you guys find some kind of compromise with me. What do you guys think?’\n“We want a green cage,” said Bogwoggle.\n“Sure!” said Matthew.\n“A black cage?” said Gristlebelly. “I want a black cage, Bogwoggle.”\nSnaggletooth said: “I want a black cage too! Why a green cage!”\nGrumblegut said: “Me too!”\nMatthew stood up and said: “You guys are in different cages! Relax!”\nThe goblins were surprised, not just because he raised his voice, but also because they weren’t scared of him. He didn’t sound malicious or annoyed. He didn’t sound angry or tired. He just sounded perfunctory but in a way that felt caring and like they were all in one cage together as a team. Matthew had made them forget they were in different cages with the way he smooth-talked them. They thought they were all in a room-cage sitting comfortably together.\nBogwoggle said: “Cage, cage! Can we move to a different cage! I want a big cage, bigger than his.”\nMatthew said: “Sure! I made your cages intentionally small because I was expecting that.”\nThat didn’t sound like an admission of guilt to Bogwoggle, who looked happy instead.\nWhen Matthew finally got a team to make a cage for Bogwoggle, the other goblins were discontent.\nGristlebelly said: “What’s this? Cage 2.0? Where’s my special cage that no one can beat!”\nMatthew said: “Are you guys hungry? Let’s eat first. The food’s here.” Several people handed him food, which he then handed to the goblins by hand through the bars of the cage.\nThe goblins accepted it one by one, seeing that the sisig they were given was only half a plate each as Matthew promised earlier. This set a precedent of continuity and trust. It was the beginning of many actions that said: “Matthew is not a goblin, that he should lie; neither the son of goblin, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?”\nAfter they finished eating, Matthew got up and left in the manner of a parent who would shortly return after buying food gifts and souvenirs to bring home—pasalubong.\nLater, the goblins saw Matthew return with a bunch of stuff in a bag. He put it down and showed them different kinds of food, toys, and drawing pads. The drawing pads were expensive, but he had never seen a goblin draw on coloring pages before. So he payed an artist specifically for the role of creating outlines of animals just for the goblins to fill them with color. He had gotten the resources, being various pigments, chalks, and pastels, from artists so that the goblins could draw. This was basically the same thing he experienced growing up in Sunday school for kids in church.\nHe made them experience what he had enjoyed so much. So even now, he was feeling nostalgic and particularly human today.\nThe food—lugaw, a glutinous rice dish—would be given after they were done drawing and listening to him tell stories of his experiences from Earth.\nThe toys were given as a prize for winning outdoor team games, so he hadn’t forgotten his roots.\nWhen the goblins began drawing, two of them fought over certain coloring materials, and Matthew was quick to show them that they could still share while getting what they wanted. However, they ended up wanting those coloring materials even more than they did before fighting, just like adults with politics. Matthew attempted to show them different colors, but it didn’t work. So he told them to wait while he got more of what they wanted.\nAfter the goblins finally got it, they were content and minded their own business.\nThe coloring continued, with older goblins helping the younger ones with difficult parts.\nAs soon as it finished, Matthew began singing religious songs for children, and he remembered them by heart. He made the goblins follow along, and soon enough, they all began singing together.\nAfter the singing ended, he began preaching, using his past experiences on Earth as fuel. The children were very obedient and respectful, even following Matthew’s lead in putting their palms together to symbolize prayer when they prayed devoutly.\nThen, after the preaching was done, he had them play outdoor team games like patintero, musical chairs, and hide and seek. As for how he did this given the circumstances, in order to get them playing these games, he opened their cages for the duration. Though the large cave-dungeon they were in was not suitable for hide and seek, the goblins were still creative.\nThen, the food arrived, and the goblins were excited to see the food and began eating with each other. If they were kids, one of them would be sitting on the lap of their older sibling and then being spoon-fed.\nWhen all was said and done, they returned to their cages as they would with a personal room if they had one. The fact that one cage was green and another cage had a different size illustrated this point.\nIn the end, the goblins didn’t understand how ruthlessly violent Matthew was. They had hit each other and banged each other against trees several times in their lives, but it was never out of malice, only childish impulsion. Matthew had recently done it with premeditation despite having lived a great life back on Earth.\nIt took only about 8 months of agony and camaraderie with goblin-murdering adventurers in this new fantastical, magical, mystical realm for Matthew to reach this point.\nEarlier, he prayed before they could eat: “Lord, thank you for the food. Thank you for everything you’ve given us. I thank, we thank you for everything you’ve given us today. I pray that our food sustains and gives us light and shows us that you matter… more than anything. Please bless this day, in the name of Jesus, amen.” He was hoping to make it longer, but he kept it short because the goblins already looked hungry.\nMatthew was not purely pragmatic: he was crazy.\nBeing purely pragmatic was never a monolith, and many people would find successful pragmatism in many different results and approaches.\nThis was Matthew’s version of pure pragmatism, limited by his own subjective perspective.\nIf he was God, then maybe the world revolved around him, and with omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence, he would achieve true pragmatism.\nBut he was only human living in a vast world, and not everything he did made sense to a linear journey seeming to maximize fun.\nIn the end, his life, as complex as it was, would never stand on a definition that made sense. All the definitions he used were incredibly tainted by personal biases and perspective.\nHis idea of emotion and pragmatism were so skewed to his sense, and no scientific analysis could easily decide for someone how to live their life, especially in respect to how words rarely were enough to communicate ideals, wants, and needs. Context was necessary, and everyone fell on a vastly different context even if they lived in the same home as someone else.\nMatthew had seen the most arrogant people become losers with a big head just after spending years studying and learning. They never changed, but it was his perspective that was elucidated. These people were big mouths who convinced people to their side, but ultimately, they were a bunch of losers who spoke loudly and never took the time to learn outside their perspective, resulting in prejucies, biases, and a false sense of invulnerability when they were just insecure people who put on a self-convinced front. Reality spoke differently, and it was funny seeing these people do their little people things. In the end, he just left them alone.\nSo his definition of this world and his perspective would remain inscrutinable for ever and ever.\nNo matter how much he tried, no one else could be him to teach him how to live. Only he could do that.\nAll these voices telling him that that this current him wasn’t who he was. That he was gifted or talented was wrong. He was just a regular person in the end, and people who kept trying to control him and put him in a box by demanding that this wasn’t who he was and that this wasn’t consistent with their idea of him were wasting his time.\nThe thing was that the voices he mentioned didn’t exist. They were pressures and expectations from a long time ago back on Earth when he was growing up, and he characterized the adventurers’ gazes and cultural expectations, duties, and responsibilities, especially with him as a peer, as these same voices; his upbringing playing a huge role into how he determined people’s views on him (as “voices”) even without their explicit expression. This was why he had mentioned being a male monster because the notion that males were monsters was subtly ingrained into him back on Earth. Overall, the interplay of Earth notions and the notions of this world exerted influence on his overall decision-making. Furthermore, his layman’s idea of pure pragmatism was only an ideal born out of notions, whether cultural, personal, or more spiritual. Finally, the [System] never truly removed his emotions for good, having only done the same thing he did before when he magically numbed Matthew’s emotions. That was the truth.\nMoreover, the arrogant people he was talking about actually referred only to three enduring entities at most, so despite having acquainted or befriended over a thousand people back on Earth, these three entities contributed significantly to his self-perception.\nIn brief, three statements outlined these previous ideas and points.\nFirst, in spite of everything, that didn’t stop his path in the realm of what he could only describe as utter rationality.\nSecond, with an intellectual gearset came the need to neutralize its demanding effects.\nLastly, he was not changing into an idea. He was chasing after an idea with all the complexities that entailed for him.\nChapter 63 - The Reckoning of the Imperfect God linkMatthew sat down, his mind a temple of peace.\nHe couldn’t divorce himself from his past.\nBut for now, he sat down, relaxing in front of the goblins. All the plans and goals people had for him fell away, like flakes of dead skin.\nHe got up and went out, entering Dungeon Astaroth.\nHe was part of a network of dungeons, and this was one of the main dungeons. So this led to an even more complex array of sub-dungeons. Things got more intricate, and the people who did try to organize this were very diligent, making it easy for people like Matthew to rise to power.\nBut Matthew was a gear in a machine, amid his defiance and his attempts at asserting his greatness.\nHe dispassionately struck goblins again and again, clearing away the earth.\nEverything was easy, but he was also avoiding everything difficult. It was too challenging for him to hold on to the strands of fate any longer.\nBut he had to be patient.\nHe didn’t want another repeat of his loss.\nHe was playing carefully.\nMore importantly, he wished the [System] would just break his emotions and remove it entirely. He wanted to fulfill the wishes, fantasies, and ideals of the people, but he was imperfect and human. He wished he could just break himself and become Perfection, become God, and become Everything.\nBut he was inevitably human.\nHe hated himself for being so weak.\nBut he didn’t hate himself.\nThis was Heaven.\nHe laughed, guffawing, attempting to restore that emotional front of arrogance, superiority, and god complex.\nBut he was human.\nHe tried again.\n“Come one! Be the sociopath! Be the psychopath that this world needs!”\n“Come on! You have to become the epitome of grace and beauty. Become the murderer! Kill! Kill! Kill! Destroy them all! Murder every last of them. You are justified! Do it! Do it!”\nHe didn’t believe what he said. He didn’t believe truly that it was okay to hurt people, and even if he did believe it when he was emotional, deep inside, he truly cared.\nBut he cared so much he wished he was a psychopath.\nHe wished he didn’t have emotions.\nIf only… If only…\nWhy did he have to be this way? To be so hateable…\nHe laughed. This was reality, wasn’t it? To be hated.\nTo be mocked and told that he wasn’t really a person.\nThat his emotions were invalid. That his humanity was just a dream.\nThat his soul was just made up.\nAll that pain and suffering just a fabric of imagination.\nHe fell to the earth.\nHe couldn’t be perfect.\nHe could only be himself.\nHe would be hated for ever and ever.\nHe closed his eyes.\nHe slashed and gripped his hand, shaking while he did so, and he began to aim it at the monsters.\n“I hate you all…” He didn’t hate them. He never truly did.\n“I am… a monster…” He did believe that, but his emotions said otherwise. He was still human deep down.\n“I have to become the epitome of grace and beauty…” He did believe he had to become so. It was the expectations of society and everyone around him that led him to believe this. The expectations of his first adventurer party who had helped him without pragmatic reason and enabled him to reach his current level of success.\nHe laughed.\nThis was reality.\nHe slashed a monster, breaking it apart. “I am God alone on Earth and in Heaven. I am the son of Everything! You will not stop me!” He was being speared again and again by kobolds.\nHe pretended to collapse before standing up. “You will not stop me! I couldn’t even kill myself! How will you be able to do so!”\nHe guffawed in a strange sense of empowerment.\n“I am God here and on Earth!”\nHe raged upon the streets of Zaun, crashing himself into tens of monsters.\nThe world was peaceful. Every moment magical.\nThe night sky never faded.\nHe was destroying lives beautifully.\nHe slashed and he skewered, making sure that impact was ravenous and tasty.\nHe moved and moved, striking the beast upon its head.\nHe was the God that moved mountains.\nHe had faith as small as a mustard seed. God could save him.\nThe monsters struck him and beat him.\nHe prayed for help.\n[Overlord: What the fuck are you doing?]\nMatthew jumped in shock. “W-who are you, Sir?”\n[Stop whining. Get the fuck out of my sight. You’re currently in my realm. Your voice called up to me. I can still see your irritating form. Get out! I’m having sex with my wife!]\nMatthew shook his head in confusion. “Who the hell… What’s this…”\nThe monsters ran away from him, terrified of the Overlord’s Presence.\n“Why would say he was having… What is happening? Is he… Oh shit! He is! He’s the Overlord. [System]! [System]!”\nThe [System] appeared, looking at him with subtle disappointment and discomfort, not wanting to be in the same room as Matthew. “What?” he said smally.\nMatthew was too scary in a way he couldn’t explain.\nThe [System] shook his head instinctively, grimacing. “What?” he repeated.\nMatthew was glancing around, concerned that the monsters would ambush him while he was talking to the [System]. “Look!” He pointed up at the magical particles of the Overlord’s Presence. “Those are… the Overlord…”\nThe [System] nodded, maintaining his outward revulsion toward Matthew. “Yeah, I know… What the hell are you doing?”\n“What?” Matthew was genuinely confused.\n“Why were you doing this?”\nMatthew shook his head in surprise. “What do you mean?”\n“You were mentally doing shit that isn’t really… you know… normal…”\n“Huh? Why’re you surprised? Anyway, what was that about? The Overlord was here. It’s crazy, you know. I’ve never seen the Overlord like this. Actually, I’ve never seen the Overlord at all. W-what was that—what was the reason?”\n“He was contacted by a spirit… and you somehow contacted him instead. You interrupted a messenger that was supposed to be sent to him. You were praying, weren’t you?”\n“Yeah. To God.”\n“To not-God. That’s God. Whatever you think is God, that’s not God.”\n“What? I mean, I was just praying. It’s not that crazy. Why are you… about it, you know?”\n“I’m just saying you prayed to the wrong God.”\n“Who did I pray to?”\n“You prayed to the Person that just came here and is now telling me… magically… that… you… should… rescind… your… blessing…”\n“Which one?”\n“The one… he gave you…”\n“The Overlord one?”\n“Yes.”\n“But… okay, sure… Okay.”\n“Yeah…”\n“You see… What you’re doing is not normal… I don’t even know how you even do this. What is going through your mind?” He said, laughing: “Are you… struggling with something?”\nMatthew furrowed his brows.\n“I’m just saying, you know,” continued the [System]. “I’ve been trying really hard to make it easier for you, but you are not okay.”\n“Yeah, I guess… I guess I am not…” Matthew replied.\n“Yeah… Do you want to do something more productive than being a whiny little whiny little fucking loser?”\n“What?”\n“You are taking so much of my energy, you know, the magic stuff, and I’m wasting it all on you. I thought you had something going on. But you are so weak and mentally deranged that I just… can’t… You’re funny, real funny. You make it laugh, and I just can’t do it anymore.”\nThe [System] disappeared.\nMatthew stared. “What?” He said, giggling, “What?” His voice became serious and scared: “What?”\n“W-w-what was that? Why! Why! No, no, no, no, no, no! No! Please… No! No! No! No! Wait! Please! Don’t! Please! Please!” He drew out that last word, tears dripping down his face. “I can’t do this! I can’t live like this! Please help!”\nMatthew fell away.\nA darkness overcoming him.\nHis eyes were widened with a grave intensity.\nHe walked back home.\nHe then sat down, shaking hands with the older man who had taken away his levels and skills.\n“Hey…” he said. “I want to help you. Can I be your apprentice or companion or some sort?”\nThe older man nodded with curious eyes.\nMatthew was now tasked to kill human soldiers in combat.\nThe older man was a soldier who played around when he was relaxing back at home, which was why he played with Matthew and made him lose his spells, because he felt that the arrogant young man needed punishing. He also wasn’t really serious about it, he’d say.\nHe just was surprised to see the same young man come to him for a job. He would actually help him, because if this man became a prodigy in combat, then he might get serious for once.\nHe didn’t know yet though.\nSooner or later, Mattew sat down on a wagon, his heart beating thunderously, his mind blaring.\nThe older man couldn’t see him as the same younger man with whom he had played around. He was a broken man, reminiscient of people who had come from long combat.\nIn his eyes, it was nice to see such an arrogant young man finally come to his senses. This brokenness was maturity.\nMatthew stared, his eyes attached to the goblin refugees on the road, as their wagon passed by. Nearby, a village burned, as adventurers poured mana stones that exploded.\nThe refugees were being separated for later enslavement.\nMatthew’s eyes intensified, and his hand on his hip gripped harder. He wanted to kill adventurers, he thought.\nAn urge. It was only an urge.\nThe older man was relaxed, not wanting to bother the young man or have any distraction distub his sleep.\nHe woke up, finding the younger man tapping him.\nA group of bandits had come.\nThe wagon was being targeted.\nThe older man leapt and did a front flip to get into position, levitating through the air for a few seconds before landing and casting tens of spells back-to-back within only a single second.\nThe Witchman was surprised, but he ended up dispatching several bandits, his hands smooth and fine, sweat only making it easier to kill.\nThe older man congratulated him, firmly shaking his hand. It was weird shaking the hand of an arrogant person. But he had become reformed. So even now, he was glad to have met him in his current level of transformation. He would love to foster this young boy delicately until he was a ripe soldier—the grooming into war.\nHe laughed. It was just a joke, a joke.\nMatthew didn’t know why he was laughing, but he shrugged and went on his way, dragging the bandits’ bodies and dumping them out of the road, as the wagon began trolling along.\nThey got back on the wagon and on track.\nThey were swift and efficient, being very powerful agents in their own right. Though, the older man was much stronger, just pretending to be weak, even with all his magical demonstrations of power.\nMatthew smiled, finding this assortment funny.\nOne of the bandits stood up and tried to attack them with a special ability he wasn’t able to cast during the fight..\nHe tripped on a rock and fell unconscious.\nMatthew burst into laugher, joined by the older man. They laughed simultaneously, unable to contain themselves with how tense things had been.\nIt was because things had become so tense that they couldn’t help it at the first opportunity.\nChapter 64 - Bing Chilling linkMatthew remembered what it felt like to sit down in the morning. He remembered the signs of the times.\nHe remembered waking up in the sun outside. He remembered removing the mud from his slippers by rubbing against the edge of a cement ground.\nHe remembered being a child. He remembered being a teenager.\nHe remembered being a young adult. Though, he was still a young adult, being 26. But he remembered being 20 years old. He was so troubled back then.\nBack now, things were much easier.\nHe had power that he had never had before.\nEarth was a hellhole.\nThis world was heaven.\nHe could do anything he wanted.\nHe was utterly justified.\nThis was victory.\nHe had become desensitized to the suffering of others.\nThis new world was his personal playground.\nHe grinned.\nHe laughed, catching the attention of the older man, who found his reaction reminiscient of that arrogant young man that he thought he wasn’t anymore.\nThe older man shrugged and didn’t mind it for now.\nMatthew felt so justified.\nNo one had helped him. No one cared. He had been helpless for so long. And no one cared. It was all gone. Everything was gone.\nBecause he was absolutely meaningless, he could do whatever the fuck he wanted.\nHe beat a goblin’s head into the wall.\nThe older man smirked.\nHe wasn’t thinking anymore.\nAll the intellectual thoughts were gone.\nWith how powerful he was, it didn’t matter how intelligent he was.\nThe only thing that mattered was that he was there.\nHe arrived, and all of a sudden, all he had to do was slam his fist against his enemies.\nBut he was scared.\nThe older man could kill him at any time.\nAnd he could have gone to Michel.\nBut he didn’t.\nHe chose not to.\nHe couldn’t bear with the hypocrite feeling of being nice and kind and friendly while killing goblins. He would rather work with someone who was plainly themselves and honest for fucking once.\nHe needed pure simple honesty.\nThe older man berated, insulted, and mocked him at every turn.\nBut that was the first time he felt calm.\nHe was used to it.\nAnd he would rather live in reality and believe in another lie.\nAll those people that he thought were friends were pretentious little hypocrites. He would kill them if he had to.\nHe would do anything to protect this world that he lived in.\nHe was so scared. So terrified.\nThey all left him. He trusted them and put his faith in them. But they betrayed him. He thought they were kind and nice. But he realized that they were all liars. They deserved to go to hell.\nHe couldn’t believe he trusted them.\nHe couldn’t believe he saw them kill and thought it was okay.\nIt was evil.\nAnd for the first time, he wasn’t going to fight it.\nBut if he was going to be evil, he’d rather admit it, unlike those disgusting hypocrites.\nHe was evil.\nHe couldn’t even word out his thoughts properly.\nEverything.\nAh.\nHe didn’t understand what he was doing.\nHe shot.\nHe shot.\nHe shot.\nHe killed.\nHe fell to the ground, exhausted, his face still.\nThe older man looked at him, nodding.\nMatthew smiled simply like a child with his father.\nHe didn’t know where he was.\nHe knew that he was finally free.\nHe was a human and monster killer.\nHe was free.\nJust a boy.\nHe loved flowers.\nHe loved living.\nHe loved the sun.\nHe killed goblin 1.\nHe killed goblin 2.\nHe killed goblin 3.\nSeveral more goblins left.\nHe slashed more and more.\nYum.\nHe ate with his dad.\nDad was happy to see him.\nHe said okay.\nHe wanted to go home.\nDad said okay.\nHe went home.\nHe laughed.\nHe met Michel.\nShifting to Michel, her eyes popping out of her head, her hands stiff on his shoulders, her eyes wet with tears, her expression that of shock, she said, “Are you okay?”\nMatthew looked at her.\n“What?”\nMichel’s dress was surprisingly simple, but the ornate symbols piled upon one another like messy sandwiches stacked inside a plastic bag. Her eyes were red, crystal in formation, and icicle-sharp in their focus. Her limbs pulled him inside her home, and she continued, “The hell’s happened to you?”\nOffended, Matthew shrugged her hands away from her shoulder, gazing at her like a threatened predator.\nMichel hid her hurt and asked, “Are you okay?”\nMatthew stared and talked the same way he spoke the last time they spent time with each other: “I’m fine, I’m fine. I’m just learning how to keep my reflexes. It’s a part of that kind-of learning process I have as an adventerer.”\n“But are you fine?”\nMatthew repeated the same excuses, speaking as if nothing happened. But the stiffness and adamance despite the contrasting context surrounding him implied much.\nMichel didn’t want to listen to him do this. He wanted him to sit down and relax and tell her everything that happened to him.\nBut Matthew was not okay.\nInstead of admitting vulnerability, he recited after asking for permission: “Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.”\nMichel was confused. “Why… What’s wrong with you?”\nMatthew was too strong to rely on lost causes.\nHe would move forward.\n“How useful are you?” he said.\nMichel was offended. “What?”\n“I was just asking. My bad. I worded it wrong. Can we work together? I’m hoping to explore some strategies and plans that I’ve been wanting to implement.” That intellectual side of him came back online.\n“Okay.” Michel was confused.\nMatthew led the way, showing her to a landscape. “I’ve been hoping to integrate this into our larger network. It’s been ongoing for a while right? I don’t want to have to repeat these instructions. So I’m hoping you can contact Deathbringer and the rest of the Seepers. Then, we can have the meeting. I’ll brainstorm, and you guys can brainstorm as well there.” For context, “Seepers” referred to his trusted circle with whom he worked with respect to his organization.\nLater, something changed in him.\nHe began exercising to help deal with his pain.\nHe worked out and did some jogging sessions in the morning.\nHe took deep breathing sessions and other forms of stretching and yoga-like positions.\nEven if Michel didn’t directly help him, she did play a role in his shift toward self-care.\nMatthew stayed at home instead of going to work everyday.\nHe prayed, helping him get into touch with his sense of self and beliefs.\nHe asked for forgiveness, but he also begged not to be forgiven.\nHe would continue to murder. That was his promise.\nIn his mind, this was honesty.\nThis was reality.\nHe would continue to do evil works, not because he hated, but because he had to be honest with himself.\nIf adventuring rested upon evil works, then he would stop pretending and accept his evil nature.\nHe was evil.\nEven with all his self-care, he abided by his moral principles for honesty.\nHe would become God. To be specific, he was not referring to God exactly, but more so the epitome of righteousness, goodness, and moral integrity. He wanted to be one with God. He wanted to become absolute.\nHe wanted to remove the impurities within his soul.\nBut in order to do that, he had to commit the act of complete adherence to a moral code.\nIf that involved murder, then so be it.\nHe chose this life, and if he wanted to change it, he would have to stop adventurers and goblins from killing each other.\nBut if he couldn’t stop it. Then like a soldier who believed in God, he would accept that this world and life involved evil acts and that in some way or form, he was evil.\nBut he would continue to pray and ask for forgiveness; also, as mentioned earlier, he would simultaneously beg not to be absolved of his sins. He would carry the burden of those sins until the day he died if he was not forgiven.\nHe would be honest for once in his life.\nHe was a soldier that could and would kill.\nLike a God-fearing soldier, he would carry the price of his actions, because it involved neutralizing combatants.\nHe would see to it that he removed himself from any sort of senselessness.\nThat was why he had to remain present and adamant.\nThis was his realistic view on how to become okay in a morally complex world that demanded monster “hunting” (murdering) and “taming” (enslavement) as an everyday, camaraderie-filled traditional practice.\nIf slavery was still here… Well, slavery was here. And he was not directly explicitly confronting it for now, focusing on indirect means hopefully to abolish it in the future. This non-explicit resistance was what he argued Paul of Tarsus had done. Being an itinerant preacher and missionary, Paul had likely interacted with both slaves and slave masters, similar to how Matthew interacted with goblins and adventurers.\nIn more practical terms, Matthew wouldn’t begin striking adventurers down, but he decided to join the adventurers with the hope of gaining influence, even if it meant killing goblins in the monster-human war. With strong influence, he was hoping to contribute to a future world where monsters and humans could live together in harmony.\nHe was just trying to make the world go round in a way where he could be sane.\nThe older man represented his methodology that included keeping his enemies close. That was why he approached him, not just because he was impulsive due to the recent pivotal events, but also because he had a broader strategy in mind.\nHe was still there, albeit smashed from time to time.\nLater, with Michel and the older man, he visited the hole at which he shot at skeletons earlier, laughing at how clumsy the skeletons sometimes looked.\nMichel planted her traps all around the edges of the giant hole.\nThe older man kept her protected from the skeletons’ projectiles and tridents with his perfectly square blocks.\nMatthew kept shooting, making sure to prioritize the counterattacking skeletons first.\nThey worked well as a team.\nThe older man—albeit a prankster who liked traumatizing little arrogant young men for fun—could work well with these more humble people. He felt that the Spirit was here, telling him to help these people grow.\nThe traps were for the skeletons who tried climbing up, and they never really were able to. But Michel added the traps just in case, making sure to centralize her traps around the spots where the skeletons had achieved significant progress in climbing toward the top.\nMatthew didn’t really know how to shoot a bow. So he missed more than 9 times out of 10. Most of the arrows relied more so on falling to the target rather than being aimed at a target far away. He had to move until his arrows were vertically aligned to hit the target before he shot. This made ten times easier.\nBut it was good improvisation for now.\nThough, for future archery skill training, he needed to get the fundamentals down instead of trying to find sneaky ways of hitting a target like these.\nHe reunited with Lumi, Thorne, and Elara. He was supposed to be with them for the next 5 months, but things didn’t go as planned.\nIt was becoming a trend. Every time he wanted things to change, it was him that needed to change. He was the reason things were changing in the first place, and if he didn’t change himself to fit a certain chance he wanted, it would fail.\nHe knew that, but he was still glad that things went the way they did. He was able to grow a lot even without Thorne’s group.\nName: Matthew Cruz\nLevel: 99\nCurrent experience: 50\nSpecies: Human\nAge: 26\nSkills: [Phantom Shield]\nSpells: None / None\nVitality: 17\nQuests:\nTitles: [Goblin Deteriorator], [Skeleton Slayer]\nUnused stat points: 0\nAttack Damage🪓: 75\nAbility Power🔥: 27\nArmor🛡️: 57\nMagic Resistance🚫: 60\nHealth🗿: 6510\nMana💧: 350\nMana regeneration💧 (per 10 minutes): 7\nHis health had grown from 2355 to 6510 before the Overlord or [System] took away the [Overlord’s Gifted] title, so he was chilling right now actually.\nThat was probably why the older man tolerated him, having a modicum of respect for him now.\nAnyway, he was also supposed to be doing something with the King of Mercy, but that also was postponed.\nHe did so many things recently, and it was already the end of the eighth month.\nEven if he went crazy from time to time, his overall sensibilities, planning, operation, and organization was bing chilling.\nHe was going right back to progress. Even Lumi, Deathbringer, and the rest of the gang was active and online.\nThey were all coming over to his crib back at the cottage.\nIt was all good.\nThough, to be honest, all that moral shit was serious stuff. He just had to chill it a bit and let everything fade into the background for a while. All that moral shit could just move away.\nBut yeah, he had to be honest for once, or else he’d go crazy.\nPeople liked to highlight and focus on his crazy moments, but it was all good.\nHe was just going through some stuff rn. But yeah, we’re back. We’re so back.\nChapter 65 - Deathbringer’s Perspective and the Troll’s Elucidation linkSeat in front of a busy street. Check. Breath in, tension out.\nDeathbringer placed his buttocks down on a wooden, nailed chair, his hairy arms pressing against the planks of the seat cautiously, having gotten his hair pinched between the edges and tight gaps before. His fingers flinched a bit before reaching out and grabbing a small piece of pie, dragging it through the air into his mouth, a gentle soothing wind tasting his forearms. He lounged, his hat nestled comfortably in the heart of his head.\nLooking around, as his teeth gnashed against the pie and his tongue got a soothing kiss of its sides, the inner walls of his mouth discharged drool for him to swallow comfortably, food bolus entering that peaceful stomach of his to be let out later.\nA whiff of finished pie entered his nostrils, as he poured floods of water into his tunnel of a mouth, their gushing sound bringing back the good times of being a child watching the large rain and mountains in the distance behind a large city.\nHe watched Matthew from afar. Crowds bustled nearby, their voices of good cheer emanating like a giant magical hand crawling upon the street paths. Wagons and giant crocodiles strolled by, accompanied by many groups of body-odorous bystanders and passersby who viewed the landscape as a boring everyday thing. The excitement in the air looked made-up to them, but Deathbringer, for the first time in a long time, wondered where he was, as if this hadn’t been the place he had been living in for his whole life. The present moment was a kiss’ moment away, and all of those love and dreams faded abruptly like sand in a soon-to-be-desolate beach. The mud-scented gravel atop which the wagons moved crunched, inviting him to ponder the weight of this world.\nVibrant-toned mountains loomed, rainforest trees joining together in disparate elements, the dynamism of the forest concealed under canopies, the animals that rushed through and across forgotten like puffs of smoke from a night-old campfire.\nReturning his gaze to Matthew, the gait Deathbringer saw was strong, the arms marvelously tethered to that body of his, his clothes as a feathery as a sunlight’s hug, the purple lines that shaped his outfit connecting the yellow shades nicely like friends in a reddened sunset glare, the breathless fine seamlessness treading each other again and again unto eternity’s upset, the feeling of greatness pulsing like a sandy beach seeking precious old pearls—a sand-laden washed blanket that only brought a sense of entrapment.\nMatthew’s eyes bounced like a song with a melody that strung the hearts of those who heard it without complacency and without too much ease—an unpredictability so tangible that it ravaged the sky above like a huricane until all men and women were freed. When he spoke, it was like dancing everywhere, the party of the air, the sun of the sky, the light of the doves shining by, hard broken stone rolling for revival, the light beating endlessly; God making his way through the hearts of many. His words were like smoking debris upon a shadowy meadow, the window emanating from his hands, a sign of hope, a sign of no trouble. He maketh rich and addeth no sorrow.\nRed and beaten were the boots upon his feet, blood and wear staining the otherwise fitted footwear, night blades having laid scar lines upon which the air soared, attempting to tear into the body of this magnanimous god.\nAngelic winds flourished from his right hand, and gracious torrents came forth from his left.\nHe was but God alone.\nCries in a night sky worried the man that sought after this glorious nature of worldly piety. Crying, tearing, singing danced where he was.\nHe was but the Angels singing above. Where he was, the world moveth.\nThe light upon his heart graciously shone.\nHe knew. He knew.\nDeathbringer saw the greatness of his friend.\nThe putrid scents of the ground pushed and turned him, threatening to break him askew.\nBut Matthew stood, unhindered. He knew the patterns of this world.\nHe knew the glory on which this world stood. And he shone above it.\nIn this world, with Deathbringer and the rest of the lieutenants, there was none like their god.\nMatthew’s priestly attire could not even compare to the greatness on which he stood.\nThe level of signs and hints that he shew upon this earth.\nHis greatness always there, great works were created by him and him alone.\nDeathbringer prayed, and he found faith in Matthew alone.\nHe entered into his places, and there he found himself on his knees and kissing the feet of his god.\nMatthew was Present.\nHe cried, wishing that the Lord could bless him again, because he feared being left behind by the world.\nBut God was here.\nHe was freed, his actions being given a sense of purpose in an otherwise chaotic world.\nGod was with him, and he felt his hand on his shoulder all the days of his life.\nHe trod upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon he trampled under feet.\nHe and the rest of the followers stripped Matthew, and put on him a scarlet robe. He was girded with a girdle of leather about his loins.\nAnd Deathbringer, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Matthew.\nMatthew presented himself, wielding a spear.\nHe, accompanied by his individuals like Zoey and his lieutenants and followers—such as Deathbringer, Michel, and Brandon, came upon a dungeon, seeking its dominion.\nDeathbringer came running to the feet of Matthew, and he, with every man and woman and child present, told them, “Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.”\nAnd there were set there six waterpots of stone, containing two or three firkins apiece.\nMatthew saith unto them, “Fill the waterpots with water.” And they filled them up to the brim.\nAnd he saith unto them, “Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.” He was referring to Tamer Languiosse, the governor of the “feast,” or vividly spread buttery language, as that was her characteristic.\nWhen the governor of the feast had tasted the water that was made holy water, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called Deathbringer, and saith unto him: “Every man at the beginning doth set forth good holy water; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good holy water until now.”\nThis beginning of miracles did Matthew in Sunto of Emerald Heaven, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.\nDeathbringer followed him and began to rend and destroy the wicked, crushing them in His Name.\nThe goblins stared at him.\n“What the fuck…” they said, as Deathbringer and the rest of the people with him glowed with group buffs that made them shine with purple and yellow pulsing lights.\nThe goblins retreated, their lives being torn apart again and again until their deaths were given no meaning and no goal except to show the greatness of Deathbringer’s deity.\nThis was disgusting.\nThis world had been turned upside-down, and they had to leave.\nThey ran, remembering the precepts to which they adhered and wished for a return to wisdom, as the goblins were being given fewer and fewer chances at living a fulfilling life.\nThey were not the Marchacha goblins who had killed Ignatius, Cornelius, Agatha, and Horatio.\nThey had no way of fighting back.\nThey could only run and hide and become displaced into foreign lands, most of them eaten up by beasts and other monster civilizations.\nAnd conflicts would arise, but a troll would fight alongside them.\nA troll emerged, stopping the adventurers, wishing upon death upon death.\nHe was the one whom one of Matthew’s followers, Shekinah, had met.\nThe troll made Matthew pause, but his followers’ courage calmed him down.\n[Calm Walker]: All calming and mindfulness effects on you is increased by 10%!\nMatthew’s memories flashed before his eyes. The many people he had met came to his aid today.\nAnd he would not be hindered.\nHe pressed on.\nHe came face to face with the troll, who had a life of his own. This troll had lost so much just like Matthew.\nBut Matthew was so immutable at face value.\nThough, inside, he was many different versions of himself that even he couldn’t completely marry together to form a consistent whole. He was his child self, his adult Earth self, his adventurer self, and many other selves. All of these schemas played around with each other, but they never consumed each other, only becoming one whole in response to a need. But this unity often involved compromises. This was why he was so threatening when it mattered, because he was a human being who experienced varying levels of emotional intelligence, depending on whether he ate well, had good sleep, or had a fulfilling social life. This was Matthew at his rawest—just another human being in a socially chosen world.\nHe was being treated like this thing, but without this social aspect, he was just flesh and blood, like all powerful and famous people.\nThe troll did not fight with Matthew, and Matthew didn’t fight with him.\nThey had a discussion in fact.\nAnd to the followers, it was the demon troll and Matthew.\nBut Matthew saw the light in the troll’s eyes.\nAmid everything, amid his silliness, rage, joys, and manic episodes, he was still a high-functioning human through and through, at least in the context of this society. If he was returned to Earth, he would also be high-functioning actually. He brought his Earth perspective to this world, and that was why he dialogued with the troll.\n“I’m Matthew,” he said. “Matthew Cruz.”\nSurprised, the troll hurriedly revealed his name: “I’m Jason. I used to be a human from Earth.”\nMatthew stared, shaking his head. “There’s no reason why you should be… Why?”\nHis face was full of shock.\n“I was forced here… And I grew to become this…” He gestured to his current body and self as a troll. “This is who I am now and for a long time now. It’s been 50 years, long enough to be a whole life. I was only a human for 15. This is not that me anymore.”\nMatthew stared, nodding absentmindedly. He was still unable to connect the crucial details together. “How?”\n“I don’t know…”\n“How did you know I was from Earth?”\n“Your name… It sounds familiar…”\n“What? I knew someone named ‘Sophia’.”\n“But they never really had normal names… Just nicknames that sounded normal. But their actual names were weird.”\n“That’s not enough evidence, but there must be some other way you’re doing this.”\n“I can only see your status page as a [System] user.”\n“User? You know computers?”\n“Yeah… I was there… in 2010. That’s the last time I was on Earth.”\n“Oh, so you know about the Justin Bieber thing?”\n“Yeah… It’s not that way anymore I’m guessing.”\n“Yeah, no more drink milk meme. And Justin Bieber being in so many games as a joke.”\n“Oh… okay.”\nMatthew didn’t want to talk to someone he knew from Earth. It broke the sense of place that he had already built.\nThis meant that he was accountable now to modern perspectives and principles, and that scared him.\nWould people back on Earth hate him if he killed the troll? The fact that he was asking this meant that he was out of touch with Earth at this point. It had been way too long.\nHe couldn’t just accept that someone was about to give him a preaching on how to deal with things here.\nIt was like someone from a different generation trying to understand why he did certain things his generation did.\nIt meant so much and so little at the same time.\nHe could accept it, but it was not going to be easy.\nHe was not going to kill the troll.\nHe shook hands with him. “What can we do?” he said, letting his more grounded Earth self slip through.\n“I honestly don’t know… I was planning to die here… So I guess I’m relieved… I don’t have to do that…”\n“Oh… My… bad… I guess…”\nChapter 66 - Inventory and Status Page Assessment linkAfter finishing up some events, back at home, Matthew did an inventory and status page assessment, looking through his skills, quests, titles, and inventory.\nHe made sure to open a fuller status page instead of a condensed version.\n[Name: Matthew Cruz]\nLevel: 99\nCurrent experience: 50\nSpecies: Human\nAge: 26\nSkills: [Phantom Shield]\nSpells: None / None\nVitality: 17\nQuests:\nTitles: [Goblin Deteriorator], [Skeleton Slayer]\nUnused stat points: 0\nAttack Damage🪓: 75\nAbility Power🔥: 27\nArmor🛡️: 57\nMagic Resistance🚫: 60\nHealth🗿: 6510\nMana💧: 350\nMana regeneration💧 (per 10 minutes): 7\nEquipment: [Michel’s Ghost Blade], [Aegis of the Ironclad], [Helm of Radiant Vigilance], [Valorweave Hauberk], [Brassairts of the Stormcaller], [Vambraces of the Shadow Assassin], [Gauntlets of the Berserker], [Gambeson: Gambeson of the Arcane Sage], [Cuisses: Cuisses of the Swift Strider], [Sollerets: Sollerets of the Shadow Walker], [Cloak: Shadow Assassin Outfit]\n[Phantom Shield (Level 1)]\nCost: 50 Mana Cooldown: 12 seconds Cast Time: Instant\nActive: The user conjures a phantom shield imbued with magical energy, forming a protective barrier against incoming magical attacks.

Earlier, Matthew hid his quests and equipment from his status page because he didn’t want to think about them. But the troll just had too many to show. So Matthew didn’t really want to mess with the troll.\nNevertheless, even if the troll’s circumstances were unique, Matthew himself was not normal. While the troll, Juan Jason, was busy hiding and tending to himself, Matthew was out here being blessed by the gods and throwing himself into life-or-death battles again. Matthew was special.\nIn the end, this was conrete and objective reality; though to be more objective, he would continue exploring his allies and followers’ status pages, basically cataloguing all his resources. But before that, he would take a trip to a dungeon in order to explore several goblin households.\nLater, there, he noticed that the goblins were separated into various ‘dorms’ or chambers that led to six doorways, as if they had strip-mined the whole place and then decided on a certain geometric shape for their uses.\nThe reason he was here was because of Render and the other goblins he had taken under his wing. These were the same goblins he had brought to the tournaments.\nAnyway, he made sure he had Deathbringer visit the place to obtain a systematic assessment of the place, because Matthew, as intelligent as he was, recognized the need to develop consistent comprehensive vision. Assessments were an essential component of vision or elucidation maintenance over a section or free area, whether tangible or intangible.\nHe navigated a complex network of activites, being the playmaker of it all, his heart threading the pieces and establishing frameworks upon frameworks with the intention of bringing together a variety of different roles and functions for a more well-founded and well-rounded organization.\nHe gathered the members of the goblin zoo that he had created and had them participate in a meeting, releasing them from their cages. In the terms of his study, the cages were preliminary progress barriers; however, with time, he recognized the goblins’ communication skills and amicability even despite the periods wherein they were let out of their cages. This was why he even invited them in more human-dominated meetings. These meetings ranged in different categories of cruciality. These meetings in which the goblins were allowed to take part were lower-level, loose, and more ice-breaking and friendship-maintaining. Nonetheless, he kept an eye on them, using his easy voice to ready them for greater things beyond what they had been initially ascribed to.\nTheir individuality each spawned unique characteristics and factors that he had to keep in mind, preparing a small unaware team for this goal. This team composed of Mindcrusher, Braindisruptor, and Shekinah; given that they were loyal, he slowly exposed them to themes to which the goblins he knew often related, such as taking care of winged animals like sprites. For context, sprites had a reputation for being disgusting pets, similar to cockroaches, and they could be seen as terrifying with their spiky hands, feet, and insect-like body. However, Matthew did speak about them favorably, contrasting the usual tone spoken against them, giving the three adventurers pause and allowing them to formulate more nuanced opinions that didn’t just align with the general populace. This was his preparation for their future utilization as possible barrier-breakers between goblins and humans within his organization, starting possibly with the members of the goblin zoo. When it came to the tournament-attending goblins like Render, their role made it impossible for him to have them be the object of the barrier-breakers because tournaments emphasized stereotypes about them, such as their disgusting ruthless and sexual depravity. In tournaments, it could involve death, as prisoners, both human and goblin now, were thrown into the heat of conflict, resulting in horrid kiling acts. Anyway, even now, the members of the goblin zoo still retained each a soul of their own, amid the human-originating societal glue that made them all look and feel the same.\nBut his list of resources were not limited to the goblin zoo members.\nYet, for now, this was the best he could do.\nWith Deathbringer obtaining assessments, he prioritized engaging with the members of his network and combining people together in various interconnected group strategies and plans. Even in smaller use cases, his intellect continued to be effective.\nHe gathered a group of goblins and went into a dungeon; instead of tunnel-visioning like the goblins who had almost killed him and chased after a pig instead of taking the opportunity to kill him, he began drawing lines with his hands from dungeon to dungeon.\nHe requested aid with regard to financing roads between dungeons and making it easier for visiting and traffic between dungeons rather than between dungeon and city. Dungeons were nearer to each other, but having adventurers go from dungeon to city and then from city to second dungeon was more easier and natural to them. Yet in a growing world, sooner or later, they would have to smoothen out the gaps and up the defensibility of adventurer activity. And adventurer activity took up a large region, relying on faulty roads that put them at a dead end and left them flanked by wild forests filled with beasts and monsters.\nOf course, it wasn’t so clear-cut as just transferring attention to connectivity and safety by establishing a stronger and more well-rounded and fuller control that didn’t leave gaps between dungeons and roads to dungeons.\nIf he wanted to make such a thing happen, he would need to have the adventurers tighten up their focus to several major and very deep dungeons to make it more effective when a set of dungeon roads were made the focus. Yet, concerns about lower floors beyond the latest cleared floors being too big a gap in terms of power required addressing.\nIt would be easy if a single-use campaign involving coalition raids into the major deep dungeon would prepare the way for establishing control.\nHowever, even with that, keeping the movement of supply and making sure the concessions holders didn’t begin withdrawing support when any disruptions or unexpected incidents that pushed back the humans within the dungeon floors occurred was challenging.\nHe didn’t want to jump the shark and start tearing away pieces of paper and then heading into the dungeon without question like a de-facto leader. He was tied down and roped by orders and requests. Desmond Leroy kept him on a noose, warning him that if he overstepped his bounds, he would be castrated and removed. The older man was an example of someone with power, and Desmond and the authorities had many more like him. The city might have been small and known to be dominated by Iron-ranked adventurers, but it was piece of a larger pie of regional control, with shadowy elements pretending all around and focusing on stability rather than outright conflict, letting the tiny pieces push and pull with each other. He was just one tiny piece really in a tiny pond.\nBut he would make this expansion plan work, hopefully without ringing bells among the higher-ups.\nChapter 67 - Finding Peace: Closure Statement linkMatthew began arranging a couple of things. Though, while he was fixing some stuff, literally piling a bunch of crates together and placing them on a wagon as a sign of unity with the more regular and new adventurers taking part in his larger regular organization, he was unhappy.\nHe didn’t want to spend too much effort doing this though, as he had more larger-than-life priorities in hand, such as discussing the distribution of ores and goods from his region. It was still a budding seed, but their goal was to invest some money in numerous interests with the intent of stimulating the market in the various areas in which they presided. However, he also had to navigate the other interested passive observers and active parties in these places. So his projection of curiosity was not ignored but given the time of discussion. He was invited to a more open meeting between leaders within a region opened up and sponsored by the city. In this case, “the region” referred to the broader Laon Region and “a region” was a smaller identified area.\nSo even now, as a smaller power, he was given the time of day to obtain information and connect his smaller networks to larger-scale agendas, even if he only played in a small pond as a tadpole.\nThis was done with the intention of processing foreign trade as well, as adventurism had a history of maritime trade and exploration with the goal of finding treasure and powerful dungeons. So this history was fostered and cultivated until the modern day where even individuals like Matthew, however small he was, had a chance to invest and play a role in a gigantic league.\nHowever, this also came with loots of ifs-and-buts, as his position was precarious, being a person who had discomforted goblin leaders. So ponds within ponds had concerns with him. The gigantic league could only provide some feedback, because they were not planning on resolving issues that would inevitably re-cycle back all over again like a bunch of organisms subjected to conditions of life and experiencing variability as a result.\nAll in all, Matthew dipped his toes in a context beyond himself. But he had to retain his footing and foot support within his region of specialty, having been dragged here by Deathbringer and Sophia and supported from the goodness of their heart, which resulting in his poetic rise to power; but broken-down and refined overtime through torturous work sprints.\nNow, his organization served as a token or ticket of his status. Whenever he approached his co-members, the senior adventurer who surpassed Deathbringer and the others he had entrusted his life for so long, he was disturbed to realize that their rise of power was not marked by a strong capacity for military strategy, intelligence, high logistical proficiency, and leadership. This meant that they were recognized for their martial prowess firstly and lastly.\nHe lowered martial prowess in his priority list, respecting people he felt were better than him. As for the reason for this, he recognized that his combat skills played a minor role relative to the amount of cognitive work he had to extend in the context of his adventures, quests, interpersonal dynamics, and connecting skilled people together. However, he thought that 90 percent of the actual work rested upon the people within his inner circle; including Sophia, Deathbringer, and Michel, among others. He added Sophia because she served as a crucial binding element in his early days; though, even with his rational perspective toward her, he recognized her help as a cultural and emotional guide. Though, her impact was minimal compared to the larger host of individuals with which he came into contact. He expressed his gratitude to all of these people.\nHowever, even now, his feet and foundations felt shaky. Even with the recent improvements in his personal life and work-life balance, he didn’t see himself as particularly capable to the point of becoming unstoppable. Extending this perspective to his practical work, when he engaged in fights, any time he had to kill a monster, he would often find his hands with a slight quivering or tremoring; never truly forgetting the experience of murder. However, he still could get in the zone and get that martial strength that contradicted his more vulnerable mental states during occasions of burnout and exhaustion as a consequence of the rapid and sudden shift in responsibilities laden upon him by his ascension to authority.\nEither way, his magic, skills, levels, experience, quests, titles, and other aspects of the game-like realm demanded vigilance not just on his part but on the part of a unique unofficial loose team composed of Rodney, scholars, and skill practitioners, with some support from blacksmiths. He agreed with them to establish regular briefing meetings where they gave him input, but that had yet to come about.\nHe had been lacking sleep lately. So he couldn’t help but be worried that he would lose everything uncontrollably.\nMichel and other people were concerned about his health, visiting him with healers and professed astrologers.\nMatthew’s organization was more stand-alone, and he paid visits to it on a daily basis, even often checking it twice a day, once in the morning and again in the later afternoon when it was hot. He didn’t want to become estranged from it, but he also didn’t know how to match the influence he had accrued due to his strategic feats and his timely interest in Grimtusk whose pillaging of a village garnered widespread international attention. His contributions to the coalition that finally breached Grimtusk’s unstoppable scooping wall were emphasized publicly despite his exit as the chief commander. It came to this present state where officials were being repeatedly requested to give Matthew their support.\nAll of these factors and events led to his current scary position.\nThat was why even though Matthew—accompanied by some from his his inner circle, his goblin followers, and selected adventurer followers, cashed out small money via dungeon raids—he was given respect.\nMatthew was not running away. This was his true limit.\nHe could only handle dungeon raids that spoke to his history as a small-role adventurer in a larger senior adventurer party since his first tumultuous, strong, and exciting entry into this city.\nHis short-scale developments in City of Power influenced his perceptions of the city, his thoughts referring back to the tanner who told him about interest around traditional methods and newer trends whenever he needed inspiration.\nHis inner circle continued to address various issues and rooms for improvement concerning the city; however, Matthew had failed time and time again to utilize their skills, influence, and talents, all while others had shown great support toward him.\nMatthew was not here as a result of his own abilities, yet he couldn’t even pay thanks to the people who had helped him so far.\nIt was a primary source of frustration for him.\nHe did want to reroute fully to daily dungeon visits and simple stats development; however, his attainment of leadership was his kryptonite.\nHowever, for now, his disheveled state would continue to head down the dungeon before being scooped back to his seat of power even if he wanted a more normal life as an adventurer. Scouting, warding, and familiar tasks he took on when he was a smaller adventurer had long disappeared, making room for heavier concerns.\nBut he knew he was not simply limited by his circumstances. His intelligence and strategic prowess was also limited.\nFor now, shifting to a more normal note, Matthew’s legs were heavier than before, having spent most of his time in less active tasks and more time talking and dealing with people from behind rather than as a part of the fighting vanguard. Optimistally, he could still considered be a part of the vanguard, but as a commander. Right now, he walked to the place where a golem-maker sculpted a golem with clay. After the golem-maker finished, he used magic to turn it alive. The golem glanced around before its eyes stopped at the staring Matthew in the distance. It waved. Matthew reciprocated it.\nAfter this, he went to his first inn, finding a familar adventurer.\nThis was the same one he talked to when he first came here at the adventurer guild.\nThey emulated the same conversation they had then. Though, much of it was in Matthew’s mind.\nMaybe, he could be okay. That was also what the guy at the adventurer guild suggested: “You could be okay.”\n“I could,” Matthew said with a smile on his face, that which he prepared for social situations. But no, he was happy to talk with someone. It was better than torture.\n“I remember a lot of things,” he continued. “I remember the sun, the earth, and all the flavors of the… time I was still just sitting down…”\n“Huh?” the adventurer said. “What do you mean?”\n“It’s hard to explain.” Matthew knew that nothing could explain what it felt like to exist.\nIt was too difficult for him.\nHe knew that isolation was a resultant threat to his sanity.\nSo with enough time to ponder, he looked around, his heart beating in all the wrong places. Indeed, he made up a motley of people, him being the most out of place. His clothes were still the white shirt and shorts he usually wore at home.\nAs for his current location, he was sitting inside an inn where tens of people were eating, drinking, and sharing stories and concerns. It was a hub of living people, and it was not the kind of place that he could just tamper with without considering his duties and rights.\nIf someone decided to punch him in the face, he could not just use the logic of his culture and society at Earth to justify the rationale behind his subsequent response.\nHe needed to align himself with this new world and its bylaws, which meant that he had to assess each person seriously with a great focus placed on how liked they were.\nThis way, he could trace the roots of likability in this new environment. Basically, his college degree did more than give him essays to write.\nAdditionally, it gave him a sense of agency in teams, so even though he lacked a team, he considered the people around him as team members.\nAll he had to do was find out exactly how each person fit into society.\nIt had all started from this inn.\nHe never truly understood people, but his mind continued to buzz and burn through the cracks, flying around, hoping to land on something that leave him restless.\nHe looked gloomy.\nBut he reassured himself that he could no longer hide the situation.\nHe talked with Michel, Lumi, Thorne, Elara, and everyone he knew, no matter how much it embarassed him to do so.\n“Hello…\nI…\nI just wanna say that… there’s a lot of things that’s going on, you know… Uh… I think… I don’t know, like there’s a lot of things that I wanna say… uh…\nSo…\n…To be honest, I have no clue… and…\n…I just… I just wanna…\n…I just wanna say that… that…\n…That I have no clue…\nWhat’s going on, what…\n…Yeah… pretty much…\n…Yeah, I think so…\n…Yeah…\nYeah, there’s been a lot, you know, I been kind of trying to like organize things and make sense of things and putting things together, but like honestly, it just doesn’t make sense. I mean, I guess it does make sense, you know, I mean, I’ve been doing so much and like pretty much I’ve… I’ve already done it, I’ve done everything possible, I’ve… like you can’t… well you can blame me, but you can’t blame me at the same time, it’s like I’ve already been doing everything and it’s crazy… Uh, so it’s like…\n…If it was me… I mean I guess it is me. Yeah, I’m the one here… Yeah, I am the one here, so I guess it is me… and… [chuckles] …I don’t know. I’m just… I’m just… I’m just here…\nI think… I… I think I’ve finally done it, right? I mean… I mean… [chuckles]\n…I… I don’t know… I mean… I… I am happy that I was able to get this far, but at the same time I also don’t know… I… I don’t know what to say… [chuckles] I mean, I… I am happy, I think… I should be happy about it and I am happy about it, it’s just…\n…It’s just that it’s crazy. I mean I never… think about it, you know, I just don’t think about it. I don’t think about like what it means really… Like I just think about like, okay, let’s just do this and let’s just do that, but I don’t think…\n…What does it mean? Like I don’t feel happy, I just am… you know? It’s like I just do it without thinking, I just… I just do it without thinking, I just do it and I just do it and I’m finally here… and… and after everything it’s like I went… I… my brain was like… I mean it was difficult, it was hard, I… I went crazy and everything went crazy… and I did so many things that I should have not done, I think… and I… I just became here…\n…I think… [chuckles]\n…and I don’t know what that means…\nI don’t know if that’s supposed to be crazy or something, but yeah, I guess I am here…\nYeah, I… I don’t know. I… I have more to say but I feel like…\n…I’m… I’m… it’s… it’s a lot, okay? There’s just… just a lot…\nSo… yeah… yeah, pretty much…”\nHe got this response by Thorne: “You know… I get it… it’s… it’s not easy…\n…I mean, I honestly don’t know what you’re saying specifically… like where it’s coming from specifically… I mean, I know that… some people go through stuff and…\n…It’s normal… you know, you start off like not really knowing what the hell’s going on, but as time passes you start understanding stuff… but like that’s what I’m kind of confused by, it’s like why you feel that way. I mean, even if I don’t necessarily understand… it doesn’t make your feelings invalid…\nI’m… I’m just saying that like… what you’re doing right now… I mean what you’re saying is kind of…\n…It… it’s… I didn’t know that this was the case. I mean, I guess I did see you and I did hear you kind of like, you know… it’s like, maybe… this guy’s feeling a little weird, or he’s just feeling a little uncomfortable… I… I mean, I don’t know. Like, I… I assume a lot of stuff…\n…And I assumed… and… I… I guess not everything that I assumed was, you know… like… it… it was not the whole picture…\n…And I honestly… I’m surprised…\n…I’m surprised, I guess…\n…I mean, it’s… it’s great… it’s great that you’re speaking right now. I’m… I’m really happy about it…\n…So…\n…Thank you…\n…Uh… thanks… uh…\n…Yeah…\n…You… what you’re saying… is…\n… … …\n…It… it means something…\n…It means something…”\nThat meant so much and so little at the same time to Matthew. He didn’t know if he was going to die or he was going to change everything.\nThe sounds of the place made him so happy.\nAnd he was excited because adventuring was exciting.\nAnd being with the people, he felt alive and like he had a beating heart.\nBut he didn’t know if this was real or how long it would last. It reminded him of his life back on Earth. Everything was great, and then all of a sudden, it was all gone. He was terrified of that happening again.\nIf it happened again with this family, these people, he would become utterly…\nLater, as his friends began eating and conversing comfortably, something simmered underneath the surface in his heart.\nThoughts drifted and combined two by two within a hurricane of spirits, emotions, memories, and souls.\nHe smiled, confused why he suddenly did so.\nHe grinned, shocked at this almost manic desire to conquer.\nHe had to stop himself before he lost it.\nHis emotions flew upward, ascending to the surface before being blocked completely. But its effects became effective.\nHe spoke inwardly: everything would fall under his control.\nThen, he would begin from the start again and again. He would repeat this devastation and this heartache.\nHe would repeat it all over again if he had to.\nHe would fucking do it again!\nHe would become the god that controlled this earth.\nNo one. No one would stop him!\nHe would castrate this earth and make it his slave.\nHe would become the epitome of grace and beauty!\nHe was the heaven above that singed everything and anything below! He was the Kingdom!\nHe was the Sky! He was the Earth! He was the Clouds!\nHe was Him.\nShifting to context, even as his friends were eating and conversing comfortably that he suddenly went into this, his fears of loss remained still. And with tranquility came a reminder of his family back on Earth and the loss that had transpired. Peace reminded him of loss, because he had lost his family and been forced suddenly into this new world. So when he saw his new friends eating and conversing comfortably, thoughts of loss spiraled out of control, and he became this manic creature that sought only authority and was bestowed delusions of godhood.\nBut he was right. He would become this god.\nAnd not just any god.\nA human-man made [of] flesh and blood, he would watch the silent moments and conquer the high skies.

There are plenty of enemies right now, and we should be careful surrounding these foes—”\n“You’re right.”\nMatthew continued, “If we got caught, we’re going to reset our progress. But you did great. We don’t need to force it—”\n“Yeah.”\n“We’re only getting ourselves used to this again. So let’s go ahead and head back—”\n“Uh-huh.”\n“Thanks for coming.”\nMatthew and Tamer smiled.\nThey and the rest of Matthew’s forces left.\nTamer said, “We should consider putting one of those stalls here.”\n“Huh?” Matthew said.\n“The ones we saw there at the dungeon steps—”\n“Which one?” Matthew began walking down a slope and avoided a tree root.\n“The one we went to when we had to fight the fortified dungeon steps but then decided to go for the smaller one—” Tamer grabbed Matthew’s shoulder and stepped down.\n“Oh, oh, that one… Yeah? So what’s up?” Matthew squinted.\n“I was saying we should put the stalls from there—” Tamer gestured.\n“Oh, that’s a good idea. But I have no idea.” Matthew shrugged. “I’ll go ask Rodney and Desmond about it. I’m often the one asking them about it anyway. I always ask about everyday stuff, so I think this’ll be fine bringing up.”\n“Why?”\n“Huh? What do you mean?”\n“Why will that be fine bringing up?’\n“Oh, I was just thinking that now was a good time…”\n“Is it ‘cause they’re always busy?”\n“Yeah, that too.”\n“Okay.”\n“Yeah…”\nTamer ended the conversation: “Okay then, let’s go.”\nThey visited Rodney.\nRodney gave them seats and said, “Why so early? What happened? Did you guys lose track of the goblins before you were able to get that momentum going, Matthew?”\nMatthew nodded. “That too. But when I saw that the goblins were already moving around a lot and very far, I didn’t want to go too far. After seeing how goblins can know their own places so well, I thought it would be better if we just stayed back for now. We can always focus on the ones that aren’t careful as per usual. But yeah, that’s basically it.”\nRodney nodded and sat. “I haven’t really talked about this, but Tamer’s your friend, right? You guys were not in a thing before or anything?”\nMatthew raised a brow.\nTamer shrugged. “Matthew doesn’t really know what he wants.”\nMatthew scowled. “Really?”\n“I’ve been asking him about it. But he’s so relentless about maintaining a virgin life. I think he’s just like that.”\nMatthew shook his head. “I’ve never heard of this? When did we talk about it? Are you kidding?”\n“Yeah of course I’m kidding… Matthew, have you finished up with the stalls while I went to the bathroom?”\n“The stalls?” He gave Rodney a glance. “We haven’t discussed it yet. I was a little tired today, so I just sat and drank coffee. Is that okay?”\n“Sure!” Tamer said.\nRodney waited.\nTamer gave him a look.\nRodney nodded and lodged his arms. “Why don’t we first consider how this stall thing will work? First and foremost, you’re talking about having stalls there too, right?”\n“Huh?” Matthew said. “How did you know?”\n“I know you Matthew. You like to talk a lot when we’re together. I’ve spent a long time with you already.”\n“Oh, really? I guess I don’t think about it.”\nTamer added, “Interesting.”\nRodney continued the conversation, “Yeah, it’ll be interesting once you hear of his attempts to cast magic that would bring light rain. He told me that he heard that if he believed hard enough, he would be able to cast magic—”\nMatthew said, “Ey, ey, ey—”\n“And he actually tried it!”\nTamer said, “Really?”\nMatthew’s jaw lowered. “Ey…”\n“Either way,” Rodney said, “we can talk about that later. So having the stalls be placed there will be easy; but of course, just because you have money doesn’t mean you should be throwing it without thought there—”\n“I get it—” Matthew said.\n“Listen first. You should think about what happens after you put it there. Will it get anywhere? Will it do anything? Is it just a waste of time? Think about… You have to think about those two, three things first before you actually start. But of course, I’m not the one who specializes in these kinds of things. So you can ask someone else I know—Brandium.”\n“Who’s that?”\n“He will probably tell you that the entire thing is a bad idea. But still, ask him. He’ll answer you. He doesn’t get anyone to talk to him about the business and all.”\nMatthew squinted and shrugged. “I don’t know. I haven’t really thought about it. Is it really needed? Isn’t it just as simple as just putting a stall and then people will find that there’s supply here and they just buy?”\n“No and yes. When there’s people actually there waiting to buy, then sure go ahead. But no, people have their own schedules, commitments, and expectations. So expect people to be like, ‘I’m not going to go here because it’s just a little bit more inconvenient than another option. That’s what goes inside people’s heads. Just the tiniest inconvenience gets them leaving, because no one likes disruptions or changing their whole setup. The point is that you’re going to have to give them a reason to leave what they know for something that involves a little bit of work on their part to get used to. A lot actually, but yeah. That’s it.”\nMatthew nodded.\nTamer sagged her head, and the table supported it and her body. She rested and listened.\nRodney ended the conversation: “Anyway, that’s the gist of it. You might want to talk to Desmond if you have any concerns about the legalities and all that. He knows whether or not you should be signing something and getting some papers readied and filled for stuff that might be tiresome. But yeah, yeah.”\nMatthew and Tamer waved and left.\nThey entered a cafe and met Desmond.\nDesmond observed them.\nThe two sat down, greeted him, and shook his hand.\nTamer asked, “Desmond, right? I know I’m usually the one being left out in meetings because my professor keeps giving me more and more assignments to do with Matthew. Anyway…”\nDesmond glanced and nodded. “Yeah, yeah, I’ve heard.” He faced Matthew. “So how are you, Matthew?”\nMatthew saw Tamer’s face and said, “I’ve been relaxing just fine. Of course, I know that I’m not actually. But at the same time, things are working out recently. But I’m not sure, I don’t know.”\n“Okay…” Desmond said. “Are you going to be there at the coalition again? We’re visiting Simaw, the spider monster. I want you there to see how we’ve been doing these past month. If you can be there, please be there with the rest. I don’t want to have to wait there only to be disappointed when I learn that you’re actually not there, because the people under you won’t want to be there. And then, we’ll have to repeat everything and reschedule for another day. It’s tiring, Matthew. I know you’re tired and all, but please think about what you’re taking care of. This is big thing. Very big. It’s bigger than whatever you’ve been doing… as a warder! It’s not what you think it is. It really isn’t.”\nMatthew compressed his lips and nodded.\nDesmond scanned the cafe. “I’ve been hungry recently, sorry.” He approached the staff, said a request, and hand-grabbed a slice of cake.\nHe approached Matthew and Tamer and sat down. “So what’s next, Matthew. I know it’s been a while. But yeah—” He took another bite. “I’m so hungry, sorry!”\nMatthew eyed Tamer.\nTamer’s palm supported her chin. She looked at him. “What?” she said.\n“I was reminded earlier of your play strategy when you decided to use the goblins to get vision. Of course, it’s a natural technique, but at the same time, I think you’ve doing much better recently when it comes to recognizing, like, whether a certain place is faster or not. Your terrain sense is much better. Or maybe you’re just faster-thinking. I think you should keep traning—”\n“Oh, my professor forced me to take lessons and start training in the orchard at the academy. He made me do laps and told me to go around the trees in a zigzag pattern so I never got sure he said. It was boring, but… if you’re saying that, then maybe it’s not so bad. Anyway…” She scanned the cafe. “Where’s Desmond?”\nDesmond and his one of his many friends reunited and began a discussion.\nMatthew and Tamer shrugged and waited.\nAn hour passed.\nDesmond finished and sat down next to the two. “Sorry, sorry. I was just happy to see Michel and her baby again. It’s been a while.”\n“Do you really use this place as, like, where you sleep?” said Tamer.\nDesmond chuckled.\nMatthew smirked.\nA minute of conversation lapsed.\nMatthew said, “Why aren’t we using the boats more?”\n“You’re asking me? You’re the one who’s supposed to be coordinating with the adventurers.”\n“Yeah, but I don’t know.”\n“You’re not coordinating with them. Hala, that’s bad.”\nMatthew stared.\nFive seconds elapsed.\nMatthew widened his eyes. “Right, I should be the one talking to them. I keep forgetting to talk to Shekinah and the other two.” The other two’s names weirded him out.\nMatthew laughed.\nTamer and Desmond watched him.\nChapter 69 - The Illusion of Normalcy linkMatthew relaxed. Getting exercise almost everyday by fighting as an adventurer made his body much more fit, so even now, it was easy to laugh and breathe well.\nHe went home and had a fresh cup of water, having brought fish and rice wrapped with banana leaves and tied with banana fiber or silk. It made for a nice meal after a long time.\nWhen his lips tasted the rice, the scent of the banana leaves added a sense of groundedness through it all, keeping his tied to the vegetated rainforest soil. The best part was that it was still hot, so during chewing, his mouth, throat, esophagus, and stomach felt the ameliorative heat: even better than a healing pot (potion).\nEither way, he rested next to a tree. The person he was when he was in a bad mood was not the same person he was at rest.\nThe sun was bright as usual, and nothing was problematic.\nA young man came to his cottage. He was from the organization Matthew was a part of.\n“Hey, we should be going right, Matthew?”\nMatthew looked at him and chuckled. “Nah. I want to relax for now. Say no kids.”\nThe young man shrugged and left.\nMatthew lay on the ground on his belly, his legs kicking up and down, his arms used as support for his head.\nHe sighed. “I’m so lazy today. Maybe, it’s because I went through the worst things in the world and now I’m fine. It’s great to still be alive.” He guffawed satirically.\nHe went to a bridge and leaned against the parapets, not worried he might fall. He vocalized to his favorite songs: “Ba-ba-ba-ba…”\nHe looked at the water, and it was this flat, plastic-looking surface.\nThe bridge had stairs on the side instead of a smooth ramp. He jumped on each step unnecessarily.\nHe was thinking of even jumping from merlon to merlon on top of the embattled parapets back and forth since they were thick enough for him to stand on with enough care. He jumped from the parapets to the bridge and then to the steps.\nHe kept walking on the flat green grass, intentionally bumping into the leaves of a tree. He pressed against its trunk for ten seconds.\nHe kept walking, passing through gates.\nHe walked up a stone staircase and climbed a ladder into a small, open, bartizan-like structure.\nAfter climbing down the ladder, he walked next to a catapult and studied it, leaning over.\nHe attempted to jump down the wall before deciding the staircase was a better option.\nHe went to the gates and returned to the open fields of grass with a decent amount of trees around.\nHe went to the bridge again, and after pausing for a bit, he kept going to the other side. He decided to make a left turn away from the bridge and head to the edge of the stream, watching the water.\nHe returned home.\nHe could hear the birds calling, unlike back on Earth when he only heard them in the morning. It was afternoon, but he could hear still hear them.\nHe walked on the road, passing by fences, ferns, logs, lush vegetation on the sides of a stream lying parallel to the road, sights of the lake, and the sound of people talking. The rain dropped softly.\nHe went inside a shop and saw a man wearing a helmet with horns. He saw weapons hung on boards on the wall and lying on the counter, tables, and desks. The music of the shop was soft at first and contemplative, but as time passed, it got only louder. Bards were present at almost every establishment, indicating a very lively and music-loving community.\nHe sat down on one of the chairs for a minute or two before he got up and listened to the music restart for a moment before leaving.\nIt wasn’t the same outside.\nHe knew the lake was right over there, though still quite far. So he wondered if he could ride a boat.\nBut he was scared of deep water, so maybe not.\nHe walked on a couple of wooden steps placed in order to traverse the stream of water that poured down on the side of the road.\nHe went up a grassy incline and looked at some of the pet animals and small urban farms nearby with both cash crops and flowers.\nHe passed by so many shops, buildings, and houses.\nHe climbed down another short flight of wooden steps.\nIncidentally, speaking of nostalgic relaxation, he still remembered a time in the Internet when he had to put “\u0026fmt=18” to the end of URLs in Youtube.\nMeanwhile, tongues of flame appeared all around on the ground in a circle, surrounding his body and following him wherever he went. They belonged to a group buff from a passing adventurer party that included him and a few others accidentally as well as themselves. Though it benefitted him actually since it gave him increased movement speed.\nHe opened up the [Forums] that he had kept out of his mind all this time, continuing to use the username “Witchman 💀💀💀”.\n[Witchman 💀💀💀: Good evening everyone. I made a post because I didn’t know what was going on. I want to ask again what happened recently. I lost contact with KingofMercy, so I was hoping if you any of you know him or know someone that can help me.]\n[RaidBossGod: laughs I don’t know if I can help you, but there’s been a recent trend of people asking about the Crystal Meat. You can follow those threads and ask them there. They might help, as long as you actually intend on talking about it though. It’s a big event, so everyone’s coming. Are you in the region? I don’t know your name.]\n[Witchman 💀💀💀: I am, I am… The region is Azz.]\n[RaidBossGod: What the hell is that? I don’t know what that is. You must be really far away then.]\n[Witchman 💀💀💀: I’m surprised I don’t know you though. Do you often visit the threads in Exploration and Resources?]\n[RaidBossGod: No. I don’t. I guess that’s why. But I’m also active only 3 months a time. For three months inactive, for three months active. Just have big plans. I don’t know about the Crystal Meat. But if you’re coming, tell me. I heard there’s pretty good loot there.]\n[Witchman 💀💀💀: Okay. I’ll tell you. Thanks.]\nMatthew didn’t know what to do. He didn’t know what Crystal Meat was, and he didn’t know if he could keep up. So he decided to leave it at that for now. Maybe, he would learn a lot, but if he was going to do that, he would be skipping a lot of his deadlines as a leader, as a solo adventurer, and as a member of the senior adventurers group where they fought hobgoblins. It was hectic, and his schedule was imbalanced most of the time.\nEven if he was already so far ahead compared to his peers his age, he still didn’t feel like he had enough.\nMatthew couldn’t understand a single thing, but he thought that came with the life and world he was in. He made it sound like he hadn’t been saying that for ten million years already. But even after spending so much time here, so little time had passed for him really. His soul still couldn’t tell the difference between here and Earth most of the time. It felt like he was playing a part or a role, pretending and lying to people about his true nature as a regular man back on Earth.\nHe didn’t really know what he was doing, but it felt right. And people supported him.\nHe just so happened to be at the right place at the right time, and he made that his identity—the Witchman figure was just him playing a part. That was all it was.\nWhen he was in a bad mood, he was in a bad mood.\nHe didn’t hate goblins every second of every day. He was more so just doing stuff. He had a life too you know.\nBasically, he was very human probably.\nMaybe, everyone was like this. He didn’t know. He sometimes became blindsided and out of touch. Maybe, he was ten million leagues under the sun in terms of how out of touch he was.\nHe sat down, not really trying too much.\nIt felt like everyone took him seriously when he seriously didn’t take himself seriously. He was just looking around from time to time, sometimes stressed, sometimes crazy. But for the most part, he was him.\nHe laid back and let the air refresh him.\nIt didn’t really make sense to say this, but he thought it’d be nice to just do nothing forever.\nEvery day could be a do-nothing session, and no one would care.\nOkay, maybe everyone would care, but still, he wanted to just take his time.\nLumi, Thorne, and Elara were not even a trio really. He just dragged them into himself and made it so that they hanged out. He coordinated people. He was that good.\nOr maybe he was just lucky.\nHe didn’t know what to do, yet he knew everything he had to do.\nBut he chose not to try too much or else he’d go crazy.\nWhy did he ever do anything?\nHe didn’t know why he got so emotional and crazy about things that didn’t really matter.\nHe just knew that was who he was at the time he felt it. But afterwards, it felt like nothing happened.\nHe was just gone. Was it all a role?\nWas he a good pretender?\nHe laughed.\nHonestly, he didn’t know.\nIf someone asked him to fix things up after everything and explain everything that happened to him, he wouldn’t say a word. He wouldn’t dare say anything. He would just sit down and mumble like a blabbering no-nothing.\nHe was entirely unbelievably readily goners.\nThis was this. That was that. There was there. Here was here.\nHe didn’t really care. Who cared about anything that happened in this world?\nHe wasn’t their god or savior. He was just a regular man.\nHe could disappear anytime.\nHe could give up anytime.\nAll of those hope and dreams? It didn’t matter!\nWhat mattered was that this was just a test for him, a playing stool, a playing ground, a sandbox, a place to hide away and create.\nThis was a place for him to throw things around like a child.\nThe goblins, the monsters, the adventurers, and everything were all just figments of his imagination.\nHe giggled.\nBut he truly didn’t know what to do if they were real.\nHe knew they were of course, but still he didn’t want to accept it.\nHe was here on another world where things like that existed. He chuckled. “It’s funny,” he said.\nNothing ever made sense, and now he was being forced to accept this. No way!\nHe laughed.\nHe couldn’t bear to think of a world where this, all of this, could happen. It was all a big joke.\nTears of joy streamed down his cheeks. It was all the biggest joke!\nHe wasn’t going to die right?\nHe was just playing a game.\nBut tomorrow he could die.\nOn Tuesday he could die.\nOn Wednesday he could die.\nThe funny thing was that he kept going either way, as if nothing was wrong.\nHe was so, so good at pretending and lying and suppressing all of these things called fee-fees inside. He was so good at being this man that wasn’t.\nHe was God.\nChapter 70 - The Great Pretender linkAfter returning to the cottage, the simple-thinking Matthew looked at his book, having been keeping in touch with details overtime. This book included monsters, creatures, and humanoids of the land; various to-do lists that were messed about; simple sketches of the cottage; number of gold coins, items, and equipment he had or encountered and details about them; the numerous people that came to visit his cottage, each of whom he asked to write a form of signature; names of people he knew; things that he hated and vented with simple phrases and drawings because he didn’t want to waste all the ink; among others.\nHe was able to begin keeping track recently due to how slow the world was. The slowness of everything was the only thing he could remember. All the exciting terrifying stuff were out of his mind. His mind had opted to forget them or keep them in sparse detail in his head. It was easier that way.\nHe wanted to visit Lumi, but she was not very organized. She did whatever she wanted, and from a systematic viewpoint, was very inefficient. She was only efficient when she fought, but not really because she didn’t really prepare that well. She didn’t note down everything and write down everything, only relying on hearsay to navigate her world. So many people gave him misnformation, and she was one of them. He was told time and time again to be careful around goblins, but things worked out for him. So he felt that the goblins were not that strong after all. Another instance of misinformation was about the golems. He was told by an adventurer named “Mike” in the past that they were important somehow, but they were just said to be important and were not actually so. The fact that he remembered Mike and how he just disappeared from the group made him wonder. He never asked about it, just like the many one-time acquintances that he met at church and at events back on Earth. Some people he knew only once. He felt there were many more, but his knowledge was limited. And he couldn’t exactly pay attention to every detail, given how annoying everything was.\nHe could only work with this much. He was saddened, but this was reality. His mind always looked for loopholes to make sense of things, but for the most part, he could only toil everyday and scrape away the bits that blocked his path to success slowly and gradually.\nFor now, however, he had an idea. With everything that happened, all the details remained out of his control, so he tried to make sure that he was doing something by relaxing at the cafe. He thought he was slowly being let go by the people around him, but that was probably alright for now. If he didn’t focus on gathering himself, then he would get himself into a weird situation and lose it. He was trying to slow down for now. If things ever went too crazy, he would not be able to approach it without becoming something that he wasn’t.\nAs long as he maintained his sensibilities, he was probably fine.\nAll the things that people said. So many truths and so many misinformed.\nHe had to accept that this world was going to be difficult to parse through.\nDid Lumi really know what she was doing? Or did she grab artifacts thinking that they were special and did something when in reality, their true power lay elsewhere?\nMaybe he was focusing too much on others. How about him? He really didn’t know what was going on.\nEven now, the kids around him spoke things that he could never comprehend.\nThough, maybe even the misinformation that he thought was misinformation was more so because of his ignorance. He wasn’t completely sure.\nBut this world had much to teach him.\nHe visited Lumi on the premise that they were going to talk about artifacts.\nLumi let him go inside, her smile as bright as usual. He smiled too. Maybe she thought the same. It was hard living out here, so any smile counted.\nLumi had him sit down, asking him if it was okay that she was the one who visited instead of her.\nMatthew said it was okay, but he didn’t know if that was the right answer. In all honesty, he didn’t know if he wanted to talk to anyone at all. It was more so about himself than others really, because he couldn’t even tell if he ate dinner last night. He couldn’t even tell if the clock struck a certain time, because the only thing in his mind was “Move, Move, Move!”\nHe didn’t know how long this facade would last, but he was here alright. While he was thinking, Lumi was talking about the recent events with Matthew taking an award for his participation in a broader war with the goblins. He brushed it off. He didn’t want to deal with that right now.\nToo many things were happening, and he only played a small role with Tamer in that war. It wasn’t even a war for him. He was just placing wards with Tamer and his other people.\nHe didn’t really do anything. He wanted to complain that actually. The King was making it very difficult for him to relax and not go crazy.\nIf only he could just sit down and have a drink, then this would be fine.\nBut no, he was expected to excel in many fronts, or else he was dead-shit.\nHe laughed silently, unable to hold in his frustration.\nLumi turned to him. “So, have you been okay recently?” she said.\nThe question caught his attention. “Honestly…” Honestly, he didn’t want to tell her anything. “I’m fine…”\nLumi nodded simply and sat down at the table in front of him. “Have you been finishing up with the preparations yet? They said you and Desmond have been fixing up with a stall. I heard that you’re supposed to be the one there making it.”\n“Making it? No, I’m just going to be there for the announcement thingy. Yeah.”\n“Oh, okay. How about Tamer? I honestly don’t know what you guys have been doing except for the warding thing in the Fracnert war. I was there with you remember? You didn’t notice me running behind you.”\n“Sorry, I was focused that time—by the way, did you hear about Mike?”\n“Mike? Who’s Mike?”\n“Oh, I don’t know. I just saw him once. He said something about golems and machines. I honestly don’t even remember. My memory’s all blurry.”\n“So are you really fine?”\n“Yeah, just a little under the weather sometimes. It can get hectic, you know, with the King telling me to go there—”\n“Hey, don’t say that about the King.” she warned.\n“Yeah, my bad. I was just saying that it’s going to get difficult from now.” He wanted to talk about stuff beyond just the King and the war and Mike. He honestly wanted to ask her if they could start preparing for another fight. He was getting itchy to fight. It was his best distraction for now, and he was looking for reasons to fight. He needed an external reason to do it, even when what he really wanted was to satisfy that urge inside.\nLumi shrugged. “You can come with us to Mount Barkog. It’s far. 4,000 meters. So don’t expect to be celebrating by the time you’re there. It’ll take a while, and bring SHR (Special Heat Remover 99).”\n“Yeah, sure.”\n“Are you going to be there? You missed out on—what?—ten other quests before. You’re not really…”\n“Yeah?”\n“Just… if you’re going to be there, tell Tamer and the others. We barely have any meetings ever since you decided to take a break.”\n“Yeah…” Matthew could only handle so much, so he had to bear with this just for now. He had chosen to take a break, and it was difficult for him not to feel confused about it all. The planning and the thinking was too much.\nThe fact that he was being expected to go again as a commander for another big coalition quest tired him out. He wanted to fight blow-by-blow. He didn’t want to stand up and tell people what to do.\nHe honestly knew that his strength was not as good as it was before. He was pampered with equipment, but in reality, he was very, very weak compared to numbers. He didn’t have his good skills anymore, and he could only accept that this was reality.\nHe was taking the backseat he felt by being a commander. It didn’t feel like a glorious purpose. It felt like a back-in-the-mind kind of duty—the thing one eschewed once one finally tried it.\nIt took much mental power and willpower. He had to be there all the time every time. No one wanted any buts, because he was pretty the tying thread, the binding element, the combining force. Without him, it would all crumble they said. But he didn’t want to do it. He would start feeding into his negative emotions and become this creature that would suddenly break down and fall apart.\nHe could collapse all of a sudden and just get sick. He didn’t want to stress himself beyond belief. His cognition slowed down when he was too stressed.\nCurrently, he was walking home, having left Tamer’s house. It wasn’t even an actual conversation. It was like a check up at the doctor. No one had any time for him, and he didn’t even have time for himself. This was the final break he could have as a human being. His soul was finally free.\nHis intellectualism was like sand on a beach. Without a healthy lifestyle, it would all go down the drain.\nHe had to sit down for once in his life and actually sit there.\nHe didn’t have anything to say for himself, so he just shut up.\nThe silence spoke plenty enough.\nEveryone was busy; no one had time for him. It was the same situation that made him leave to the City of Power.\nBut honestly, he was probably at fault. He put them all in a situation where they could only keep working. He was the one who put them in that situation, and then he decided to leave (take a break) all of a sudden. It was a do-or-die decision to have all of that set up and invested in.\nHe was very impulsive.\nHe made big projects only to let them go, and he was here taking a break. It had been two days already.\nHe didn’t want to take care of anything, except himself for the first time in forever.\nHe lay down next to the door of his cottage, his legs leaning against the steps of his porch. “How tiresome…”\nHe was so weak.\nHis body could barely move. It wasn’t that he was physically weak, but he burned himself out to oblivion.\nHe made it sound like he had everything under control. But everything he did was all this big joke. This big facade.\nHe was just that good really.\nHe did all of that and then fell apart, because he was just that good at pretending and then suddenly disappearing. He loved throwing himself into things that made him lose his grip on reality.\nIt was fun.\nHe was the type to go in hard and then impress everyone and then just disappear out of nowhere because people expected him to continue forever. It was all one big hard-work overcommitment gamble. It wasn’t even a gamble. It always led to burnout. Every single time. He was just playing with fire at this point and then eating it.\nHe burned himself. He burned himself out. Get it?\nHe laughed, still unable to take anything seriously. Everything was too hard to take so seriously to the point that he didn’t just laugh it off. He wanted to laugh at everything.\nBut yeah, he was serious. Very.\nHe sat down, not bothering to make a statement.\nHe had nothing to say that was special.\nHe was just a regular guy after all.\nBut he would rise up from the ashes. Shut up.\nHe was just a man.\nNo, he would become God. Shut up.\nHe was just a person.\nHe would become the epitome—Shut up!\nHe didn’t really have anything to say for himself.\nIt was all one big game, and he was the great pretender.\nHe was so good at becoming God, only to bleed all over Heaven’s floor once he had taken the throne.\nHe was so funny too.\nHe burst into cackles.\nWheezing all over the place.\nHe didn’t hate anyone. He just wanted to have fun.\nBut it terrified him.\nIt scared to think, to breathe, to see people.\nIt scared him to see a person.\nGoblins used to be terrifying, but it was people that terrified him. Their psychopathic thoughts, their narcissitic desires. The fact that they could just do something so horrible and get away with it. They didn’t feel a single thing.\nHe lived in a world where people just murdered without remorse or guilt.\nAnd he was doing the same. He was a fucking hypocrite! Hahahahaha!\nHe loved this world so much because it tested him. He was being tested by God! God tested him!\nGod loved him so much that he would do such a thing as this!\n“Overlord! System! I love you!”\nThey ignored him.\nMatthew laughed hard before escalating to silence. He stared at the world, feeling detached from all of it.\nHe did not feel real, his vision blurring and zooming in and out. He was dissociating.\nHe would become free, right?\nHe laughed in his head, but outwardly, he stood still, staring aimlessly.\nHe saw a goblin walking up.\nHe walked outside like a normal man and greeted the goblin like he would with a cat: “Hello, Goblin! How are you doing?” And he treated all cats like people.\nChapter 71 - The Descent and the Resolve linkThe goblin struck him and attempted to kill him. “Disgusting, disgusting, disgusting!” it said.\nMatthew. No, Witchman struck the little baby thing and made sure it lay still on the ground in its final death throes. “Brother, oh, brother, I know it is hard for you. But I love you. I love you so much that I have to do this to you. I understand you feel bad right now, but this… This is God speaking. I am your God, and you are merely a tiny little thing. I will speak for you and eat you.” He grabbed the goblin’s arms and tried to bite it before he realized.\nIt would taste so good.\n“Fuck, what am I doing? he said, jumping back. “I’m just kidding. I didn’t actually feel like eating…” He trailed off, realizing that he was not okay.\nHe realized that he had a psychotic episode there for a second. His diagnosis was not actually kidding, huh. He probably was in a manic state as well. But he wasn’t sure.\nHe didn’t really see a notification that popped up when he was being impulsive or not. He just was.\nShifting to a more objective perspective, this scene didn’t reflect the experiences of all individuals with Bipolar I Disorder with Psychotic Features, especially given that he was in a fantasy world and very unique circumstances and psychological landscape.\nReturning to Matthew, he realized that all his intelligence had led to this point. Like Friedrich Nietzsche, he got the equivalent of his insanity that began 11 years prior to his death.\nHis urges for violence were so strong, and it was likely psychopathologically linked to his past traumatic experiences and mental condition. His intelligence had taken a backseat with the deterioration of his mental state.\nHe attempted to stay composed and keep in touch with his intellect, but he wasn’t completely confident about it.\nHis capacity for analytical thinking rested upon his ability to navigate complex landscapes. He could use this break to invest in physical exercise more, and in doing so improve his wellbeing.\nYet, the emotions lit up, leaving him to Grief’s arms,.\nThe burden of memory was too heavy to handle. Every he held dear had been changed or corrupted or had vanished or died with time and now only existed in the mind. He lived to carry these echoes within him into the future. Call it nostalgia, but he knew in his heart that it must be more than that.\nHis family smiled at him.\nHe reached out.\nThey drifted into thin smoke, their faces distorting.\nHe laugh-cried. “Ma. I love you! Ma!”\n“I’m sorry. Ma. I’m sorry Jared, Vick, Quincy…”\nHe begged to be freed.\nHe grabbed his throat and held it tight. “I’m… I’m just a man, right?”\nThree.\nTwo.\nOne.\nHe relaxed his breath. “I’m just a human being, which means… which means… I have to…” He burst into shouting: “Keep going!”\nHe had stopped himself.\nHe was not going to die to-day.\nHe had to be free.\nMatthew looked around curiously, attentively, and intently and began prowling on four legs like a beast.\nHe transformed slowly, his posture and form becoming streamlined.\nHe crawled slowly first then stably.\nThe beasts around him stared.\nAs soon as they got close, he slashed them with his blade, crushing them heavily clumsily messily.\nHe desperately tried to kill them more than he could ever could.\nThey were already dead. He kept going.\nBlood leaked all over his clothes.\nHe grunted like he was having sex.\nHe moaned as the blood splattered over his face.\nHe climaxed with everything messy.\nThe body he had chosen became a work of art.\n“You are my slave!” Intense feelings of domination usually found in sexuality began to take form.\nHe was addicted to power.\nHe snorted it all up in lines and smoked it in joints, blunts, and bongs perched between his lips.\nHe sighed in relief like after drinking a full bottle of fresh cold water on a strikingly hot day and taking a shower when everything tired, lethargic, and just generally worn out. He freed himself from this mental deterioration by accepting his impulses and becoming one away from withdrawal.\n“I must become your teacher… and your guide,” he said, throwing away the blade and pumping his fists together, walking forward menacingly.\nHe would conquer this planet and then this universe. He was the sole owner of it all.\nHe laughed unto the end.\nHe walked into a coalition and began tearing away the land block by block. He stripped it bare.\n“I am God alone on this Earth and in the Next.”\nHe laughed, stripping away the flesh off hundreds of goblins with his blade of doom.\nHe crushed them and broke their fleshy bits, wishing upon them grace and beauty unto the heaven’s parting.\nHe slashed them right down the middle, blessing them with a sacred bisymmetry.\nHe bestowed upon them his great fervor, massacring them like a child with his playthings.\nHe raised his arms, first to the left and then to the right, and then extended them outward.\nHe raised his right hand. “Rejoice…”\nHe killed ten goblins.\nHe killed 15 goblins.\nHe killed 16 goblins.\n“…in the Lord always; and again I say…”\nHe cast [Phantom Shield], blocking tons of damage. “Rejoice!”\nThe goblins stared and screamed in fear.\nHe skipped from step to step, sliding away and forward, striking the goblins with a whip-like blade that grabbed them and tore them away, leaving them dusted and burned beyond recognition.\nHis sword did not burn them, but it showed them the path to the light that when their bodies were shattered beyond belief, they “burned” in its greatness.\nA hand grabbed him, casting a healing spell.\nMatthew fell to the ground, his eyes closed, faint, unconscious. The man that killed hundreds rested in silence.\nThe stare of the goblins and adventurers around him were that of fear and trembling.\nMatthew did what he wanted to do. He brought them together.\nA truce was cast in order to control this man.\nHe was Love, Adoration, and Grace.\nHe was the Epitome of Grace and Beauty.\nThey feared the giant man.\nAfter contacting Desmond and the other people with whom Matthew had made contact, they surrounded the area and built various forms of containment.\nEven if the adventurers were permissive and loved killing monsters, Matthew wasn’t hiding anymore. He was declaring out loud in shouts all his grandiose demands and beliefs about himself. This was easily noticeable and identifiable, so it wasn’t that difficult for the adventurers to get help.\nIf it was just him looking crazed, then that wouldn’t be enough for help or intervention to come, because combat could make someone look crazy.\n“What do we do with him?” said a voice.\n“I don’t know. How do we deal with him?”\n“He can’t be let out. He’s a monster. He’ll kill us all.”\n“Yeah, be careful about moving him. We don’t want another escape but for him, especially not him. Don’t let that be the case! Prepare as much soldiers as needed. Make sure to remember the code of ethics. We don’t want him dying on our watch, but we’re as hells not going to let him escape. He needs to be contained.”\n“Okay, okay. But what do we do if he gets out?”\nLater, Matthew could be seen sitting down in a chair, his gze down, his arms shackled, sitting down inside a carriage pulled by seven giant crocodiles.\nA donkey waited for him outside.\nGod was he good.\nThe quiet noises in the background began to rattle. It was so quiet, but not so quiet that people felt truly comfortable.\nThe sounds were messy like scratches on a tree.\nZero, one of the soldiers, didn’t want to leave this man alive, so he took out a knife and began to stab Matthew in the neck.\nMatthew’s neck bled, and his head leaned downward.\nA healing spell was cast on him through a hole leading to the top of back of the carriage. “What are you doing!” said the healer, who was sitting next to the driver. “Stop trying to kill him! We have to keep him alive!”\nZero grabbed Matthew, making him lean onto him to get a better knife angle. He stabbed further and further, attempting to kill truly this heinous man.\nMatthew, because he was moved so much, woke up and began casting his [Phanton Shield] only to find out that it was on cooldown. He screamed and raged desperately, but he was stuck to the floor and walls with chains. He roared.\nZero kept going and then with one big slash, struck Matthew through the neck.\nMatthew healed himself with the blade still inside. As Matthew kept healing, the blade kept preventing him. Soon enough, Matthew got exhausted, and his vision began to blur.\nZero begged please for this to work.\nMatthew begged for his salvation, because he knew he had a greater purpose beyond this.\nThe [System] glanced at him from afar. “Do we help him?” he asked the Overlord.\nThe Overlord shook his head and left, with the [System] following alongside.\nMatthew roared like he was grieving, distracting Zero for a moment before the other soldiers, who had been paralyzed in fear and confusion the whole time, decided to help Matthew and grabbed Zero away.\nZero screamed: “No, no, no, Mom! Mom!” He had lost his mother to Matthew’s rampage. What Matthew killed the fight wasn’t entirely goblin.\nZero begged to kill him, and the soldiers, while crying, told him he couldn’t, that he had to let it go, and that this was too much. “Please, do this for us! Do this for us!”\nMatthew was able to heal up after one of the soldiers pulled out the knife.\n“I’m sorry,” said Matthew. “I didn’t know that I killed your mom.” He guessed based on little information he had.\n“I’m sorry.”\nZero immediately calmed down and began crying before he turned to rage. “I’ll kill you, you monster! I’ll kill you!”\nMatthew stared at him, uncomfortable and ashamed. “I’m sorry that I killed her…”\nZero kept repeating the same thing, all while the soldiers stopped him.\nIt was a tragic sight, something that wouldn’t go away from the minds of any of the people present.\nAs mentioned several times and implied numerous times before, this environment—the world, with its harsh and unforgiving monsters; its people, which were tied to camaraderie and peer support surrounding the killing of goblins; and its culture norms, with its adventurer-centric and great-man–centric idealisms—had systematically eroded his humanity and enabled his descent into monstrosity, something that would never have happened if his Earth life had continued seamlessly.\nTo explain in figurative terms, having a manic episode was like drowning and suddenly waking up somewhere else with different clothes in the hot summer in a peaceful day with memories that denoted a whole different life. He knew that he was crazy, but when it was finally over, it was as if he never was. Having a psychotic episode was like eating carrots and thinking they were apples to the point of actually treating every carrot like a apple, including biting them as if they were apple, holding them as if they were an apple, and referring to them as if they were apples, even adamantly in front of family and friends. Though, for the most part, for Matthew, he heard voices speaking to him loudly and from afar, knowing that they were fake but still heavily distressed by them as if they were real.\nHe had to cope, and that was all there was to it.\nWhen he woke up later, he felt the I-just-took-a-shower feeling at the beginning of a new day after a long day yesterday. It was fresh, yet his throat and voice ached. He had this sticky feeling of dried sweat, and his head was beaten-up cognitively. He was so exhausted, and everything was prickly.\nThat was what happened each time he had a mental breakdown, but this time, it felt like swallowing hard rocks heavier than a ship.\nThe guilt was surreal.\nAlways the same guilt after an episode.\nHe laughed weakly. He felt utterly devastated that he had been dragged into this cursed world.\nA smile tried to play on his lips.\nBut nothing worked.\nEach time his thoughts inched toward Oblivion (mania), it failed to reach the egg cell.\nSimilar to how he had strategized and used his intelligence systematically to navigate battles and engagements, the world used that same systematicness agaist him.\nHe floated upward, realizing that he was powerful beyond measure, but not in a grandiose or violent way.\nBut he saw the worth of a man trying hard to live despite his failings and undeservedness. The fight to live was a hard one, and many reasons could be stated as for why he had to die.\nBut… why should he?\nHe didn’t have to die until he had done everything he could to be better.\nHe was going to reach the end dammit!\nHe prayed that he could be okay again, and maybe this was the same old lie he had been telling himself.\nHe couldn’t keep pretending, but maybe he could.\nMaybe that was the only way.\nHe didn’t grab a blade this time.\nHe wanted to talk to Sophia.\nAfter visiting her grave, he said, “Hi, Sophia. I barely know you. I barely know anyone. I barely know the sky, the clouds, the people, the people… I barely know you. I’m sorry for not being there all the time. Maybe you’re not real. Maybe… I’m just using you as a surrogate for my actual family back on Earth. Do you know why I do this, Sophia? I do this for you. Not for you. But for the idea that my old life still defines me, that I can still guarantee myself through it all. You showed me that I could still be human. Why did I have to leave the sacred path? Why did I have to leave my brothers and sister? Why did I have to leave everything behind? It’s all gone, my friend. It’s all gone…”\nHe left, barely walking, mostly straddling the air as he tried to lift himself from step to step. He was gliding, or falling each time he took a step.\nHe grabbed his clothes and removed them, leaving them on the ground. His blade was gone, and he was actually being surrounded by guards.\nHe walked naked.\nHe was free to define reality, and even if he felt very embarassed, he hated to live this world lying to himself. So this was for him too.\nHe wanted to be honest for once.\nThe guards then brought him back to his prison, having only allowed him to visit Sophia’s grave for the time.\nChapter 72 - Becoming linkThe cries for Matthew only grew louder.\nMatthew was in prison, but he was in no way hated by the majority. In fact, he was applauded for his service.\nHe decided to write while in prison, and time passed.\nHe wrote a book—his equivalent of Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon (the Prison Epistles). Much like how Paul’s epistles sought to shape the early Christian church, his book sought to shape the early Matthean community.\n“I will conquer this world, and it will be my domain. No one, not anyone, will dare hold it against me, for I shall hold their life by the throat.”\nThe prison released him soon enough. Despite being sentenced to 50 years in prison, he only served a month.\nMatthew got up the steps leading outside, greeted by the people. The waving of hands and greets encountered him, their object of fascination.\nHe was their New King.\n“I am Matthew Cruz. I started this, and I’ll end what I’ve started.” He grinned; a full consolidation of all four identities—Matthew Cruz (Earth) Matthew (New World), Witchman, and Scrappy.\nHe lay a claim to the crown, but he kept silent, dispersing himself into various corners of the city periphery.\nHe struck goblins in the west, making waves of adventurer parties.\nHe delivered the pain with a strategic capture of a fortified fort in the east, scouts making their way to him right now.\nHe rancidly poured his rage in the south, keeping his focus tied here to cope with his urges.\nHe used the north to keep himself balanced and relaxed, using it as a place of rest while the adventurers did most of the work.\nMatthew disappeared into his role, and his actual self sat down at a cafe, where he talked delightfully to Lumi, Thorne, and Elara, the three people he knew the most around here.\nIn reality, nothing had changed between the him before his mental breakdown and the him after.\nHe was still level 99, and he still had same equipment. He still was a member of the adventurer team of stronger adventurers. And he would still struggle to fight hobgoblins. However, what was different was that he was now influential, like politicans back on Earth who couldn’t physically fight to save their lives. He had influence without necessarily having a proportionally equal amount of combat prowess. This was possible.\nSomeone needed to humble this man.\nAs Matthew gained influence, many more men and women like him popped up like maggots revealed under a rock.\n“I am the Teacher,” said a young man staring at a group of goblins. He used his hand to slap his enemies to the ground, castrating them with spells that made them too weak to stand. Then, that was when he slapped them and crushed their little tendies (tender parts). He gave them the whooping of a century.\nIn contrast to Matthew’s growing influence, others had reacted in opposition against Him.\nA scholar, one of Matthew’s old acquaintances, wrote of Matthew and his ilk: “Adventuring used to be about principles, now we stand by this… Heathen! He defiles our principles, our sacred arts, and the wishes of those who have generated Adventurism into existence. Is it not fair to put him to the execution stand? Then, shall we see if his godhood remains incorruptible.”\nMatthew loved this earth, and he would not let any of its people fall away to sand and dust.\nThe scholar’s friends spoke in defence of Matthew, and soon enough, the scholar was found a screw-loose thinker, whose voice carried marginal weight in the political shifts blessing the city.\nMatthew embodied adventurism in its purest, unadulterated, and uncompromising form.\n“Stand up for me as I have stood up for you!” he ended a speech to his followers at a rally he conducted in the streets near the cafe, referring to the hardships he had endured in service of adventurism. He had such a big following that he could gather his followers to a place and then begin making his speech there, using his intelligence and capacity for grandiose statements, declarations, and manic (meth-like) emotion to persuade them. Thus as his followers listened, so did many passersby and bystanders.\nHe wasn’t silenced, because he was thought to be describing adventurism and elevating it to the men, women, and youth who continued only to tire of its demands.\nAs long as he veered away from treacherous thoughts, he was allowed to preach the word of adventurism.\nLong after the rally that he had modeled after one of the hundreds of religious regional events wherein he had played a heavily personal role back on Earth ended—he went to the streets and saw a bunch of beggars.\nHe remembered the two beggars he had seen at the now-defunct second adventurer guild. They looked weak and starving. He grabbed their hands and told them that the future was going to include them. He would make the city great again, with its lengthy history dating back to prehistory.\nHe realized that he could help them.\nHe learned many things in his textbooks. He knew that a man named “Gutenberg” made printing a thing; though, he wasn’t sure how to do it.\nIf he could democratize knowledge, then maybe this world would become free.\nCould magic help this objective?\nThere was actually a war going on, but that was not his focus right now.\nYet even amid all his groanings, hunting, and influence-building, he recognized that this larger piece of the world demanded his attention. Every step of the way had built him up and broken him down, refining that man that he was.\nToday was a form of debut. Like a man soaring through the clouds, he would become.\nLumi asked him earlier during his conversation with her, “I don’t really get it, but okay.” Her very words contradicted adventurism as a concept, but that was not the point either.\nNone of this was the point.\nThe point of all this was to send a message. He didn’t need riches or the demanding nature of adventuring, of being a leader, and of being a broken man to validate him. What he needed was to be as loud as he could, whether it brought him controversy and even dislike, so long as all of this fell under his plan of deep-seated honesty.\nIf he never broke free from these shackles formed by his own mind, where would he be? In the trenches of battle? In the caves that left him starving, beaten, and mentally drained? In the zone where all hope vanished and the only thing that maintained coherence was endless slaughter?\nThis was hope when it was most illogical and unbound to sense and logic.\nNo, this was simple statement: “Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye!”\nHe only needed that one thing, all else fading.\nHe sat down, and in his rage and anger, he kept silent. In his heartfelt aches, he demanded nothing. In his refusal to obey the law of silence and stability, he nodded simply, as if nothing else demanded anything from him. But the world sought his approval. It needed his begging. It needed his invaluable input.\nHe was King, and nothing else mattered after that.\nAll was faint soldiery activity, broken renderings of what was supposed to be valid. It flowed down a river valley, and there it dissipated: unable to find itself again.\nLike a man that submerged himself in a river and left, once he returned, he was not the same person, nor the river the same river.\nChange occurred nonsensically, and he acted according to this internal logic impinged by his mental unsoundness.\nHe loathed, and he loved. He saw fit, and he saw unfit.\nReady steps paved his path; then broken strides kept him assuaged.\nEverything went and went. He fixed the hitherto broken things.\nMatthew rested, his heart pounding his chest.\nLumi sat down next to him. Thorne sat down in front of him. Elara stood far off.\nThese three said that if he dared showed his face again after all that had transpired, they would cut him off. A consensus among them concluded that he was not to be trusted.\nBut they were just talking earlier.\nWhy did they sat that afterwards?\nIn all his confusion, he prepared himself a table, at which he wet his head with oil in the face of his enemies. He was his own savior, and one else meant anything after all.\nHe thought as a man wanting much, but maybe that was all falsehood.\nHe wanted those emotions to be more than just an expression.\nMaybe with all his strivings, he was god.\nMaybe, with all those heartaches, he commanded meaning.\nEven now, he sat down next to one of the goblins that Tamer had tamed. She told him that the taming spell effect could be broken, and there were no buts or side effects.\nThat allowed him to do anything he wanted. But did he?\nShifting to the scene, he sat down and asked himself a question, but out loud for the goblins to hear as well: “Why is it that I have come this far, so unburdened by the challenges imposed upon men in battle, yet so burdened with the principles with which Earth has blessed me? I am so unbelievable hypocritical, staring so widely at a land that should be, but isn’t my place of rest. I am… a horrible… horrible creature. I stand before the world, and I am God. But I stand so idly so as to be so uncaringly inadequate. If I cared more, would I have done more? Would I have said, ‘Aba, Aba, I am adequate before you?” as I struck the heathens aright?”\n“He,” he said, “not a day goes by when I am truly at peace. I am my own unraveling. The signature of my domain and Doom. I am Signature Peace, and I am Signature Death. Let them all fall before me, for I am truly unhinderd in my actions. I stand on the door, and knock: if I hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with myself, and I with me.”\nThe goblins listened and inquired, “What have you to say of your actions? Are you really infallible?”\n“That is not what I said.”\n“Are you really good?”\n“That is not what I’ve mentioned.”\n“Are you powerful?”\n“That is an exaggeration.”\n“I do know that you and everything that you are have come here for a reason, right?” the goblin Render said, referring to his presence here to talk to them like a man in need of counseling.\n“I was and I am here for a reason. I want to make this pain… ugliness… devoid-ness… I cannot be.. but I am… so utterly… I am…”\n“You are?”\n“I am…”\n“You really truly are like this?”\n“I do indeed am. I think this is my natural state. I am going to kill you now.”\nIn his imagination, he slashed them and broke them apart, their hands falling away, their hearts becoming mush, their minds surrending to the fate dictated by the man who called himself Matthew the Saint. He hugged them instead in reality. This was fantasy. If it was reality, he would be doing as his nature told him, but this world had turned him to so many things. What else was there? He cried in the arms and chest of the goblin under the chin, wishing that he too could be genuine and not evil. He was an evil man. Could he be saved?\nShifting away from this man, everywhere around him toiled, which every morning sought.\nA young farmer stood, staring at the distance, “Won’t it be a good day as alway?”\n“Yes, Shadrach, it will be,” said an older man in his eighties.\n“I’m so happy that I’ll be able to spend time with you guys.”\nThough their voices be undescribed and ambiguous, the silence carried enough weight\nThe tones their little mouths and bodies wielded conveyed the greatest mysteries and brought them light. They cast a lamp and said, “Oh look! Here is the answer to all your mysteries!”\nThat crisp happy sun never let them down.\nChapter 73 - The Gathering Storm linkMatthew stood like a monkey in the horizon, creating tiny little orbs of light. He shot them toward the horizon.\nHe sat down and watched his followers herding in front of him.\nHe walked again, disappearing into the crowd.\nThe crowd accepted it, and one of them, Mindcrusher, watched his juniors walking up to him. “Sir,” said one of the juniors. “Shall we set up the boat?”\n“No, we don’t need that now. Let us create altars that show our devotion unto him.”\nThey created a golden statue of Matthew in the middle of an open field, and they began to worship him.\nMatthew chuckled. “Why don’t we have a fun time?” he said, tossing a drink upon the people: pouring water upon him that was thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground.\nReturning to the junior who had spoken to Mindcrusher, his name was Luke, and he left the field into the city.\nHe began taking part in a very adventurer party, being one of many adventurers that had gotten past the beginner level, but were still only one step above the very beginning. They still had a lot to go that he couldn’t even truly be counted as Iron. Many adventurers made it a point to gatekeep people from using the word Iron if they weren’t at least rank 800 and above, because of course, if they did allow people to do it, then it’d feel dilluted. But that was their own opinion anyway.\nEither way, from the city, he entered a small forest area, near where Matthew first started adventuring. He was with his buddies.\nGrimslasher “Luke” Painwrath - Level 10 Status: 511/511🗿, 300/300💧, 55🪓, 0🔥, 30🛡️, 25🚫\nSorrowstrike “Elara” Bloodreaper - Level 9 Status: 510/510🗿, 300/300💧, 55🪓, 0🔥, 30🛡️, 25🚫\nDreadreaper “Merlin” Fearmonger - Level 8 Status: 508/508🗿, 300/300💧, 55🪓, 0🔥, 30🛡️, 25🚫\nTorturelord “Aria” Dreadfiend - Level 7 Status: 507/507🗿, 300/300💧, 55🪓, 0🔥, 30🛡️, 25🚫\nTheir enemies were\nOrc - Level 1 Status: 1000/1000🗿, 500/500💧, 160🪓, 0🔥, 30🛡️, 25🚫\nGoblin - Level 1 Status: 500/500🗿, 300/300💧, 22🪓, 0🔥, 30🛡️, 25🚫\nLuke shot an enchanted arrow that pierced an orc’s back, dealing 33 magical damage, having Elara strike the orc with her enchanted greataxe.\n“Good job Elara!”\n“It’s a heavy-hitter.”\nThey had done a double-whammy, using two skills in impressive successive, completely rendering their orc target stunned.\n“[Bang Lover!]” said Elara. It dealt several extra points of extra damage, dealing 64 magical damage in total.\n“[Cold Air Touch!]” said Luke. It added a 10% slowness effect to his enchanted arrow.\nMerlin and Aria were coming in.\nAfter the stun effect disappeared, the orc tried to hit Merlin and Aria, but Merlin used [Dash] to increase his speed by 5% and barely dodged the hit. Aria immediately cast [Spikes] afterwards, hurling spikes that struck the orc for 30 physical damage. Merlin then struck the goblin, dealing 23 physical damage.\nWhile they were distracted, the goblin used [Frozen Bite] on Elara, dealing 20 magical damage.\nThe orc grabbed Elara and struck her, dealing 64 physical damage.\nLuke quickly hacked the orc, dealing 36 physical damage.\nElara cornered the goblin and sliced it with her greataxe, dealing with 21 physical damage.\nMerlin threw several daggers, dealing 21 physical damage.\nAria cut the orc’s right leg, dealing 23 physical damage.\nThe goblin hit Elara, dealing 8 physical damage.\nOrc punched Aria, dealing a whopping 147 physical damage.\nLuke used [Burst Fire], burning the orc, dealing with 56 magical damage.\nElara sliced the orc’s chin, dealing with 60 physical damage.\nMerlin kicked the orc hard, dealing 25 physical damage.\nMerlin and Elara grabbed the orc and pulled him down against Aria’s ice icicles, dealing 32 magical damage.\nThe goblin stabbed Aria, dealing 18 physical damage.\nOrc used [Burdensome Bad Breath] at Luke, dealing 130 magical damage.\nLuke cast [Shadow Steps], passing through the trees and lacerating the orc, dealing 58 magical damage.\nElara gashed the orc, dealing 41 magical damage.\nMerlin struck the unsuspecting goblin, deaing 31 physical admage.\nAria tackled the orc before striking it with a deep spear handed to her by Merlin and Elara, dealing 59 physical damage.\nGoblin poked Aria with a blade, dealing 9 physical damage.

He also grabbed the greataxe and handed it to Elara.\nElara redirected her focus on the goblin, dealing 55 magical damage.\nMerlin followed up, dealing 65 magical damage.\nIn the meantime, Aria blocked the orc and struck it, dealing 45 physical damage.\nThe goblin ran, grabbed at Luke, and struck him, dealing 17 physical damage.\nThe orc beat Merlin up, dealing 94 physical damage.\nLuke scared the goblin and shot it with another enchanted arrow, dealing 46 magical damage.\nElara crushed the goblin, dealing 44 physical damage.\nThe goblin was defeated.\nThe orc curled his lips in response.\nMerlin covered the path of the orc and frustrated it with a spear strike, dealing 44 physical damage.\nWith Merlin distracting it, Aria stabbed the orc from behind, dealing 52 physical damage.\nThe orc ran at someone else, Elara, and swatted her, dealing 159 physical damage.\nLuke was now free to focus down on the orc.

Aria dealt 30 physical damage.\nThe orc crushed Elara like he did earlier, dealing 178 physical damage.\nLuke cut the orc, dealing 42 physical damage.

We’ve never had a guy like this in a long time. How long has it been? We’re practically starving for a new figure.”\nMerlin said, “At this point, they’re just releasing them like flies.”\nLuke said, “Yeah, haha.”\nAria said, “I wonder though, why has the city been faint these past few months? It’s as if everyone’s holding their breath or something.”\nElara said, “I heard that there’s a celebration later. Wanna come?”\nAria said, “Sure, but first, what’s your favorite food guys recently? I know since we moved toward this part of the city. You guys have been hungry for puto bumbong.”\nElara said, “Of course we have.”\nMerlin said, “I saw it earlier actually.”\nLuke said, “Dang, I wish I got some.”\nMerlin and Elara said, “Yeah, me too.”\nLuke stared.\nAria said, “Guys, are you not going to eat? We’ve been hungry for a while, but yeah, I guess this is good too.”\nLuke said, “Do you think Matthew’s the one right now. I know we’ve been saying it, but still… I’m still worried I’ve gotten myself into something I’ll regret.”\nAria said, “Maybe? Of course it’ll be something you’ll regret. You’re a spineless bastard, haha.” She meant it jokingly.\nBut Luke remained serious. He had been thinking recently about the changes in the city, and much of it was caused by Matthew. Or at least that was what he believed. “Do you guys want to try using the boat thing that Matthew said? How does that even work? Do you guys want to be the ones helping out there?” he said.\nAria said, “Do you even know how it works?”\nMerlin said, “The boat thing is not important. What’s important is whether Matthew will come through with what he said—”\nAria said, “Of course he’ll come through with it. He said it already, and he has a track record for being very reliable in raids. We haven’t lost a single raid recently, and that’s probably because of him. I mean, I’ve seen it myself. He’s no joke. He’s all serious and shit. I saw the look on his face, and I immediately thought, ‘That guy’s problematic. I should steer of him.’ I mean, I’m not sayin’ he’s bad, but the way he glanced at me. I was shitting myself.”\nMerlin said, “Really? I didn’t get that from him. All I got was that he was a simple effective leader. Leaders are crazy you know? That’s what you get for being at the top. No one really wants to be… Or everyone really wants to be there until they reach the top, and then all of a sudden, you’re expected to excel. People like him are there because they’re leaders. That’s just what their made of.”\nAria said, “I see what you mean. But still. Crazy’s crazy. And don’t get me wrong, Luke, that’s commendable.”\nLuke said, “Why are you saying me? I didn’t say anything against him. I was just saying that I have no… or I’m not sure whether this’ll pan out nicely, you know what I mean?”\nAria said, “Yeah, I get it.”\nElara said, after drinking water to swallow down her meal, “You guys need to really get a break with the boys back in church. They said there’s a new update with the progression sphere.”\nAria said, “The progression sphere? What’s that?”\nElara said, “Oh, it’s just a new project the church has been working on. It’s for kids, so it’s not what you think it is.”\nAria said, “Oh… oh, okay.”\nLuke said, “Right, that’s what I’ve meaning to say. Let’s go! All of us! Together! I know you guys aren’t used to the atmosphere and the people and the, you know, the kind of place that it is. But I’m telling you that it’ll be fun. Plus, I’ll be there. I’m fun.”\nAria said, “Yeah, right…”\nLuke stared at her.\nAria said, “I mean sure. I can go. But yeah. I’m… especially with what’s happening… not completely sure if I’m going to make it. But yeah keep in touch. I’ll tell you about my schedule…”\nLuke nodded. “Sure.”\nAfter a short lull in their conversation, Merlin said, “Hey, what’s been happening recently with Mikael? They said he’s getting Retribution? What’s that?”\nAria said, “Oh, well, it’s the new spell that recently got on the board recently. People are saying that it could be used to help neutralize the damaging effects of necromancy. But I don’t know.”\nLuke said while finishing up the bibingka, “It’s a holy spell, of course?”\nAria nodded. “Yeah,” she said with a sassy inflection.\nLuke said, “Oh, what’s that about Ratrizi? I don’t know why my classmates have been saying it, but there’s a recent new thing going on about Ratrizi and the dungeons I heard. Any new boss updates with them?”\nMerlin said, “The Ratrizi. Yeah, they actually already captured him, but they want someone else to be the one to exorcise it because they’re hoping to keep the experience points it gives refined. But yeah, no one is sure yet. They’re still picking a candidate. As for the boss monsters, yeah you can ask them about it. I don’t know.”\nAria said, “Let’s just relax for now. I’m already on my last semester at the academy, and they’re asking me to fix up some things for Mindcrusher as well.”\nLuke said, “You too? I just heard this now.”\nAria said, “Mindcrusher, you too?”\nLuke said sassily, “Yeah.”\nAria said, “Oh gosh, goodie us then.”\nLuke kept his sassy tone, “Yeah, that’s right.”\nMerlin stared at the horizon. “Okay, guys let’s head home. We’ve already gotten enough… Want one more?”\nAria looked at her inventory. “Yeah, sure, we can go.”\nLuke stretched his shoulders. “I’m prepared. Give it to me!”\nMerlin said, “Okay then.” He walked first and then watched Elara screaming at the forest to get the goblins’ attention.\nNow that they had rested and recovered, they went to fight again, finding 6 goblins that responded to Elara’s call.\nLuke grabbed Goblin 3 and burned him with an acid flask, dealing 50 magical damage.\nElara grabbed Goblin 3 as well and kicked it forward, dealing 35 physical damage.\nMerlin weaved through the battle and struck Goblin 6, dealing 28 magical damage.\nAria reached for Goblin 5 with a spear and struck it, dealing 41 magical damage.\nGoblin 1 struck Elara, dealing 9 physical damage.\nGoblin 2 kicked Merlin, dealing 8 physical damage.\nGoblin 3 clawed Elara, dealing 19 physical damage.\nGoblin 4 sliced Elara from another direction, dealing 14 magical damage.\nGoblin 5 joined along and cast [Fireball] at Elara, dealing 14 magical damage.\nGoblin 6 went for a different focus. He blocked the adventurers and cut Merlin, dealing 11 physical damage.\nLuke struck Goblin 3 again, his favorite, dealing 39 physical damage.\nElara raised her greataxe and sliced Goblin 3, dealing 53 magical damage.\nMerlin avoided Goblin 3 and struck the Goblin 2, who hadn’t been touched yet, dealing 24 magical damage\nAria looked for the next untouched goblin with her [Spikes], Goblin 4, dealing 22 magical damage.\nGoblin cast [Spear] and hurled it at Elara, dealing 22 magical damage.\nGoblin 2 cast [Red Bite], dealing 18 physical damage.\nChapter 74 - The Unseen Challenge linkLater, after Luke and his three fellows dispatched the goblins, they stood as tiny figures.\nTheir eyes watched the large buildings around him.\nIt was like they were living breathing gigantic wagons.\nHe began to relax, closing his eyes.\nRedirecting his focus to the wagon next to him, they rode it.\nThey began moving back to the city.\nLater, at the city, they sold loot.\nAfterwards, they went home.\nThe large city loomed around them.\nIt was gigantic, and nothing seemed off.\nThere, again, Matthew’s presence came and went like a ghost in the night.\nHis mind was at ease, then tumultuous, and then at ease again.\nReturning to Luke, he watched the streets outside.\nHe peered for the morning bird calls.\n“Chirrup-chirrup!”\n“Chirrup-chirrup!”\nThen, they sang a familiar song.\nHe listened.\nHis heart became calm.\nWhat lay outside was a sharp sound.\nIt was the sound of passersby.\nHe rested his eyes.\nThe city noise hummed.\nDogs moved about.\nPeople danced and sung.\nHerds grazed and wandered.\nSky clouds loomed over.\nStreet buyers haggled.\nVendors murmured.\nFootsteps came in droves.\nFires burned.\nIce melted.\nWomen spoke.\nMen talked.\nChildren laughed.\nMatthew walked, creating a world so bright that none ever found a sense of peace. He was the shaker. He shook the earth, and his heart sung a song that melody that traversed all generations, each beat carrying a weight that swung the world askew. He was the Progenitor. He was the Healer. And He was the Protector.\nThe city noise stopped.\nDogs became still.\nPeople sat down and became silent.\nHerds shut their mouths and froze.\nSky clouds dissolved into invisible air.\nStreet buyers stared.\nVendors kept quiet.\nFootsteps disappeared.\nFires dissipated.\nIce paused.\nWomen hesitated.\nMen’s lips were arrested.\nChildren gazed.\nLuke glanced outside.\nNo one saw Matthew.\nBut they saw a powerful man that could rule the world.\nThe streets returned as if nothing happened.\nEveryone pretended that Matthew was an ordinary man and elected to ignore him.\nAfter returning home, Luke began fixing his stuff in his house.\nHe put together a bunch of bags.\nHe arranged items together in a sequential pattern.\nHe loosened his grip on many items while testing their durability.\nHe used the skill [Check Durability] to do so.\nMeanwhile, his sister came into view.\nTurning his attention to his sister, Luke smiled.\nHis sister was tall.\nHe was short.\n“How are you?”, he said calmly.\n“Good, good,” his sister, Amanda, said.\nShe looked around. “So, are you going to Witchman?”\n“Witchman?”\n“That’s what they call Matthew Cruz, right? The goblins, I mean.”\n“I didn’t know that.”\n“Well, you know now.” Amanda smiled.\nLuke asked Amanda if she was good with her studies at the academy.\n“Yes, I am,” Amanda said, “but first, let’s fix this thing you’re doing. What are you trying to do?”\n“I’m trying to sort this according to the ACB pattern.\nLuke looked for her attention and found it. “Apparently, it’s a good way to make things fixed.””\nAmanda nodded several times with a thoughtful expression.\n“Good then,” she said.\nIt had been a while since she got to talk to Luke after everything he had been through. They moved out from their parents’ house only two months ago, and it was Luke’s duty to keep attending the academy still. However, he got involved recently with adventurers and then with Witchman, which wasn’t really the best thing. But it would for now.\nShe was just happy to see him, even if only once in a while.\n“Luke,” she said. “How’s the adventuring?”\nLuke pretended not to be annoyed about her common question. “Ah. Well, it’s fine I guess. I haven’t seen the others come around to it.” But he hoped “the others”, which referred to his older friends, would accept his invitation to join him in adventuring.\nAmanda nodded and frowned with understanding. “Okay then.” She turned around and began leaving. “Just tell if there’s anything you need, alright?”\nLuke nodded, and he left as well.\nHe sat down at a park.\nThere, he saw people walking about.\nBut he was looking for a specific person.\nA man in a mask walked up to him and sat down.\n“How are you doing?” said the masked man.\n“I’m good. How are you?”\n“Good, good. Amanda’s ‘kay?”\n“Yeah.”\nThe masked man was his older step-brother, Wiseman.\nWiseman and Mathew Cruz shared foreigner status, and that was why they both wore masks frequently.\n“Well, I guess I’ll be off,” Wiseman said. “Thanks.”\n“Wait, aren’t you going to say something… else?”\n“Thank you… Oh, oh, you’re talking about the wallet, right?” He took out a wallet and handed it to Luke. “Thanks for reminding me.”\nThe wallet was just an item that held money magically.\nBut it was hard to get.\nThat was why Luke was smiling excitedly right now. “Thanks.”\nWiseman stared.\n“Okay, then,” he said.\nHe left.\nLuke was chirping happily with his new toy.\nSoon after this, Luke reunited with his older friends, eating with them at a tavern.\n“Are you guys serious? Only drink little! Only drink little!\n“Nah, I’m good!” said one of his friends, Ryan. He was tipsy already. “I’m just…” He hiccupped. “I’m just doing what Wiseman does!”\nLuke raised his brows, locking eyes in a staring contest with Ryan while his other friends got food from a nearby cafeteria.\nLater, the second friend, Josh came inside.\nHe closed the door quietly, bringing a bag.\nAfter passing through the store, he came to a table.\nLuke and Ryan were sitting at that table.\nPutting the bag with the food down, Josh said, “Hey everyone. How’s good? How’d good? This is it. Sisig for us three.”\n“Four,” said the girl following behind Josh, Sally.\n“No more. You already ate!”\n“I said I only ate last afternoon. Not today!”\n“Ehehe. Too late!”\nJosh teased Sally until right before she got mad.\nAnyway, they sat down.\nAnd that was when they began to eat.\n“It’s good?” said Josh.\n“It’s good,” said Luke. “Never tasted this? What’s it called?”\n“I said earlier. It’s sisig.”\n“Oh, that’s… I’ve heard of that. Why haven’t I eaten it before?”\n“You’re spoiled, that’s why. Hahaha!”\n“Okay then,” Luke said, genuinely offended. But he composed himself pretty quickly.\nRyan had his head on the table already, his arms supporting.\nHe groaned.\n“Ha, Ryan’s dead already,” said Sally. “Why did you guys give him drinks in the first place?”\n“He bought it,” Luke said.\n“Well… I wasn’t here,” said Josh, disappointed that Sally would include him in the blame.\n“Have you guys heard of the progression sphere?” Luke said, looking at Sally specifically, who had an adventurer father.\nSally squinted at him. “Why?”\n“I don’t know. Just asking.”\n“You shouldn’t be talking about that here.” Sally gestured to Ryan, who was already half-asleep and too groggy to understanding what they were saying.\nLuke furrowed his brows. “…why?”\n“He lost his father ten years ago. That’s why. He doesn’t want to hear about that sphere nonsense.” Sally looked around in case anyone else got offended.\n“What?”\n“Just don’t talk about it.”\nJohn was tensely glancing at them, only staring at the wall for the most part. He had no clue what they were on about.\nSally looked at Luke before tilting her sitting away from him.\nJosh raised her brows, directing this gesture toward Luke, before turning away from Sally when her eyes scanned their faces.\nA moment later, Sally looked at her hands from behind, rubbing her right hand against her left forearm. “So, ever heard of bibingka then, Luke?” she said with a friendlier expression.\n“Yeah,” Luke said. “I heard that. I eat it all the time.”\n“Okay then…” Sally was disappointment. She would have teased for it if he didn’t.\nJosh forced a smile throughout the scene.\nLuke pretended to clear his throat. “Okay, so how are you guys?”\nSally moved her lips to one side in thought.\nWhen Sally was silent for too long, Luke detached his gaze from her and looked to Josh.\nJosh glanced at him, having stared at the wall too long that he was introspective. He brought back himself to reality.\nAfter burping with a pause and then drinking water to clear out the possible hiccup, he said, “Well, we’re chilling I guess. I mean yesterday I was just fishing with Sally. She said it was tough work. But I thought it was fun. Well… that’s it. Yeah.” He subtly shrugged. It was the kind of gesture that was done instinctively but suppressed right after doing it.\nLuke nodded slowly. “Sure! How about you Sally?”\nSally smiled and raised her brows in an attempt to engage in the conversation. “Well, I met Richard again after three years. He said he’s been adventuring.”\n“…really?” Luke was interested.\n“Yeah, yeah, you want to meet him. I can help you contact him.”\n“Sure, but be careful…” Luke wasn’t sure to do this joke or not. “I might end up taking him away from you.”\nSally laughed genuinely. “Well, don’t be late then, because I’m actually going to go with him tomorrow for dinner. We’ve been dating for 15 months already.”\n“Huh. You said you just met him after three years.”\n“Yeah, that was like officially back here, because we haven’t met here in the city. We met though at City of Power, so that’s what I meant. So yeah, officially three years, but actually only like 10 months or 9.”\nLuke thought about the fact that they were dating for a while. “Huh. Pretty cool.”\nSally nodded, doing that polite repeated brow raising as a gesture of agreement.\nAfter Luke spent some time eating Ryan’s food after finishing his, he said, “Can you guys finish this?”\nSally shook her head. “Sorry. Give it to Josh. He’s been starving for a while now.”\nIn the meantime, Luke got up suddenly, looking around as if he was in the middle of a war.\n“Ha,” Josh said, waking up from his tipsiness as well. “So you really have been full this whole time. You look sick.”\n“Yeah, I guess I wasn’t that hungry.”\n“Ha!”\nSally gave Josh a playfully forbearing smile.\nWhen they finally left and Luke helped Ryan leave, Luke soon parted ways to Ryan to head to the adventurer fields.\nHe was planning to meet Matthew’s lieutenant there for a roll call meeting with his team.\nLater, at the agreed place, Deathbringer, one of Matthew’s many lieutenants, stood, his gaze firm and his eyes full of awe and wonder, as if he was communing with God on a day-to-day basis.\nLuke got one look at him and immediately decided that this would be the place to stay.\nHe trusted people with that look, because he himself was not that passionate or confident whatsoever.\nHe never could do the things Matthew Cruz or even his lieutenants could do everyday, always fighting and being at the forefront of the whole war in this sector. It was amazing.\nDeathbringer got his attention quickly with a gesture. “Okay, how are you Luke?” he said before asking the same question to Luke’s team members that later arrived one by one.\nLuke saw Aria and immediately asked her about the progression quest.\nBefore Aria was able to answer, Deathbringer shushed them and said that they had to try fighting an orc without weapons.\nLuke raised his brows. Why?\nAria looked at him. And they got what each other was thinking.\nElara and Merlin were also aware, not even needing to make eye contact. They were already mesmerized by the orc in chains coming forward, and it was flanked by two new soldiers under Matthew’s banner.\nOrc did not see.\nOrc did not look.\nOrc was blinded.\nBut it could kill with one hook.\nLuke didn’t want to ask the question.\nThe orc was the one who shouted it, “Who will fight me!”\nChapter 75 linkElara struck the orc on the left, breaking its stride. Aria climbed on top of her and kicked the orc on the chin before striking it on the neck with her palm. Luke and Merlin went behind him and struck the sides of its bellies.\nThe orc groaned, falling down.\nThey switched positions when the orc struck at Elara, compromising her stability and frustrating her movement. Elara was hit and fell to the ground.\nAria caught her before calling for a back-off.\nLuke began running to and fro as the orc tried to hit him. Merlin went behind the orc and kicked it on the belly, tripping all by himself.\nThe orc took advantage of this and reached to grab Merlin.\nDeathbringer grabbed him before he died.\nThe orc was promptly put into chains again.\nDeathbringer smiled. “Good work, but not good enough.”\n“Good work! Looks like you’re all well-acquainted. But tell me. Do you guys have any clue what we’re going to be doing next?\nMeanwhile, in another place, some distance away, a young man woke up, and the only thing he heard was a loud thud, his heart aching for a sense of presence. He got up and started placing his things together, hoping to leave.\nHe was on a tall mountain, and around these parts and air, monsters loomed and flew, snatching victims and prey like a grinder did to discarded goats.\nNot a single sound let out an eek, because too many things were already being gobbled up. Just one tiny peek was all the monsters required.\nThe young man, Mr. Gobsmeek, didn’t want to spend his days in tire, hoping to engage with the wildlife much better.\nSo he went out and found himself a little spot to rest.\nThough, he didn’t want to idle too much. If he dared idle too long, the monsters would catch wind of his presence. That was why he levitated on top of a cloud, never leaving its margins.\nHe was hoping to get a cow.\nBut here, a cow was rare and often fleeting. They spawned every 4.27 seconds at its peak, but right now, it was slow, around 10.27 seconds in duration.\nThe monsters were piling on, snatching the cows that had already been reduced to flesh.\nHe got himself working with his utencils, hoping to piece together a magical ball. It was an artifact, you see, one he got from a friend of his. His friend told him, “Don’t forget to piece together a little blue ball; then you may throw it as far as you like. The monsters will follow.” That voice echoed within his memories, leaving a mark that left his heart smooth and unhindered.\nHe got up and began raising his hands, preparing to let loose this magical ball.\nThe ball was hungering, tiring, screaming.\nIt exploded, flying off into the horizon, finding its mark below the stars.\nThe monsters, in a hurry, began running after it, hoping to find what made it so special. They were going to find nothing fortunately. The boy had already gone.\nDown there, in the valley, where the prey went, Gobsmeek grabbed for a cow, but the cow fled his grasp.\nHe grabbed it again.\nThe cow was fiercely disobeying.\nHe struck it and made sure it didn’t struggle anymore. He prayed.\nThe silence bloomed.\nAnd the man brought home a feast.\nLater, on the way home, he sighted a group of adventurers: Luke, Elara, Aria, and Merlin, who were celebrating.\n“Let’s go! Yeah!”\nThey had just killed a second orc.\nMr. Gobsmeek and the four adventurers were headed the same way—to the shower mages.\nSoon, at the shower mages’ location, the adventurers were in the middle of a conversation.\nAria said, “Guys, let’s just finish up. No more after this right. I’m tired.’\nElara said, “Yeah, good. Better than nothing honestly after what happened—”\nInterrupting Elara, water was pouring at them from a group of mages standing atop a knoll, where they were showering a group of customers below.\nSubsequently, Merlin said, “Ha, can we talk about this later guys? I can’t hear you through the shower.”\nLuke muttered, “They’re not talking about anything important. Don’t worry.”\nMeanwhile, nearby, getting a shower as well, Mr. Gobsmeek nodded in a slow, repeated motion to relax his headache.\nElara said, “Guys, did we get it down a while ago already? The chores set by Mrs. Ada?”\n“Nah…” Merlin’s face went pale. “I forgot about that actually.\nLuke said, “Don’t worry guys. Don’t worry. She’s my aunt. So we’re chill. Chillin’ Billin’.”\nElara nodded to get the water out of her nose.\nAfterwards, they didn’t have anything left to do, so they parted ways and went home.\nHowever, Mr. Gobsmeek was heading the same direction as Elara.\nElara recognized him. “Gob. Where’s your sister? Isn’t she supposed to be grinding the ship? I don’t know how you guys didn’t tell me about it. I would’ve come.”\nGobsmeek said, “I don’t know. Don’t ask me. I’ve been trying to fix up my cow session with the boys. We’re going to be leveling up soon enough.”\nElara said, “Leveling. You’re still on about that? That’s not how it works, okay? You’re not ’leveling’. You’re grinding.”\nGobsmeek said, “Who cares? It’s just a word.”\nElara said, “Okay. Just tell me where you sister is, and I’ll get out of your tail.”\nGobsmeek said, “‘Kay. She’s at the Municipal Offices.”\nElara said, “Oh, why is she there? She just started work?”\nGobsmeek said, “No, she just wants clarification regarding the new implementations in the ACC region. Have you seen the tributaries recently? There’s been hoggers recently. So I don’t know what they’re going to actually do regarding the new implementations. They said it won’t take long before it shows, but they haven’t been very adamant regarding what’s actually going to happen.”\nElara said, “Really? Tell me. Did ACC himself talk about it?”\nGobsmeek said, “No, ACC wasn’t there at the meeting, my sister said. She went there yesterday, and that’s why she’s going again.”\nElara said, “Yeah, I heard about that. The hoggers. But they’re just kids. Don’t worry about that—”\nGobsmeek said, “Well, they’re taking up too much space. They want to start experimenting with the tributary rewards, they said. But it isn’t that simple. Spreading smoke around the area is only going to block people from actually being able to enter. It’s unfair to the rest. Sure, the council did announce that it wouldn’t take that long before the seniors started bunching up and then naturally, it would take its course. The young hoggers are just going to leave. But still, the implementations? Seriously. I’m getting tired of having to see it. I mean, that’s my sister’s fault really. She keeps complaining to me about, and now I’m starting to think she has a point. Of course, don’t take my word for it. Luke probably knows better than I do. He’s the one who’s with Matthew, right? Matthew was the first one who got a hold of the academy, and now they’re making communications about the new setup with the tributaries and the prison sentencing. The monsters are being killed off, and then you have the researchers right?”\nElara said, “Yeah, I know.”\nGobsmeek said, “Yeah, that’s what I’m saying. That’s the point. They’re not going to leave until my sister goes there and gets the ball rolling. They’re actually going to mess things up more due to not being clear enough. The Adventuras and the Marciples agreed with my sister when she went to talk about it. So I’m not entirely out of line, hey.”\n“‘Kay…” Elara mirrored his language to get him out of her tail.\nShe left without saying much. She didn’t want to talk to him about the current political shit going on, and most adventurers didn’t want to care either. They were just going their job. And they didn’t want to shake hands with the seniors who had the mandates to deal with.\nLike the first adventurers, or the new adventurers here in Emerald Haven, she would rather abide by a simple framework or outline of law or rule.\nTo her, it didn’t matter what Gobsmeek said anyway. He was predominantly focused on considerations of current circumstances and factors, rather than strictly following ideological premises. In other words, he was a political realist, a man who loved delving into the minutiae of practical considerations instead of prioritizing maintaining a coherent ideological framework or narrative thread.\nWhether Elara liked it or not, Gobsmeek used her as a sounding board for his in-depth concerns.\nIndeed, Elara was the only one who truly disagreed with Gobsmeek rather than plainly agreeing, while still expressing a true interest in honesty and moral integrity.\nThey often argued and were in bitter and cold terms, only appearing friendly on the surface. But they didn’t hate or hold a grudge against each other. They merely differed heavily in their communication styles, personalities, methodologies, rationales, core values, and beliefs.\nElara noticed the fringes of Matthew’s regional influence again, her concerns vastly outweighing his. She thought Matthew was a fraud.\nShe thought his entire life was built like an industry plant.\nShe did not see him as anything but a “mid” average man.\nShifting to a more omniscient perspective, in contrast to how people would usually react, Matthew would have loved to hear that she saw him as just a normal person. Being special only brought him issues, and he hated being dominant or better than others because others would then alienate him in the process, leaving him all alone and in a state of semi-permanent dissonance.\nBut Elara did not know that, and she merely dismissed him as a blot.\nAfter returning home, she came face-to-face with her vast array of armor, treasures, weapons, tools, and desks.\nShe was a collector of sorts, but she did truly find uses for each of these items. She didn’t like artifacts. A strict principle of hers involved discarding artifacts as soon as possible, because she thought they broke the natural laws of this world. However, she was fine with magic, because she believed it was naturally inherent to people.\nAfter sitting herself down at her desk, she played around with her cartography tools, sketching a structured table that revealed to her the scope of her adventures, resources, and needs.\n“If she could, what would she do?” she wrote, her gaze becoming unfocused. She found herself staring at the street outside past the bars of her windows.\nThe children played outside, and dogs were running about.\nThey were not children. They were boys.\nThey could have been named Billy, Notch, and Shadrach, and no one would ever know.\nShe smiled, thinking that it would be nice to imagine them as people and not as stains upon the field of street roads outside her doorstep.\nShe saw not a person, but a vast land filled with glory and honor.\nAnd that inspired to fall to sleep, imagining herself drifting into a flying wagon that led her to the stars.\nShe got up and headed outside, putting on whatever she needed and getting whatever she needed.\nShe was all much prepared to meet Luke and the others at Deathbringer’s beck and call.\nMatthew stood at the horizon, his giant form continuing to overshadow the region. His internal conflict lay unbare, clothed, too clothed, too unbathed, unwashes. The sun needed it back. The sun wanted it to reveal itself.\nMatthew swallowed the ground, chastening himself for doing so. The ground was his undoing.\nHe swallowed and painstakingly devoured the dust of the earth.\nHe was the Progenitor. He was the Progenitor.\nHe struck the earth, and a vast land awakened. He was its glory-stone. He was its glory-bone. He was its glory-awakening.\nHe created and he cast the stone upon the woman, fo he was sinless beyond measure. His holiness thou art. His holiness thou art.\nAskance, askance, glares sights, munster rights. baintan. Azlxlxlxl.\nInterlude (1) - Daydream 1 linkMatthew stood atop a hill, staring at a wide landscape.\n“I give up. I have finally realized that this is all a waste of time. War, violence, sex, conquering, power, supremacy, superiority, overconfidence, recklessness, blood, girls, sex, death and everything and the opposite of forgiveness, never doing tough choices, and never killing? All teenage, sophomoric, childish ideals of a boy disempowered and struggling to find definition in a chaotic hard-to-navigate world. In the end, I am just a person, and the weight and cost of my immaturity had caused thousands of people grief. I am that person who genuinely believed that they were special enough to demand much of the world, and I was given power. Power that didn’t understand what it stood to gain or lost. It lost so much. It gained only a sense of tire. I am an evil man, not because I did horrible things. But because I genuinely saw the evil of my actions and did them anyway. Maturity is all about getting a boring job and living a banal life. And that’s better than being a mass murderer who organizes genocides. Better than a murderer who gets the action and conflict of life. But fun can be found even in the most ‘boring’ moments. Milestones like helping others find themselves, treating people with kindness, and not focusing too much on oneself. Too many people are selfish because they believe in a dog-eat-dog world. It’s childish, because it only fulfills that prophesy. The only people willing to give someone up is to believe genuinely that someone would do the same to them.\n“Being an adult is about learning how to live with banality and the repetitiveness of work. It’s about struggling to take care of a family, and even if I didn’t get married, it’s about learning to be just that. A human being. That’s already hard enough for most people. Most people lose themselves doing things that didn’t matter.\n“This is all useless.”\nHe chose to stop and said no.\nHe returned to what he was as an adult back on Earth.\nThis world had brought him childishness and regressed him to teenage ideas.\nBut now, he found the difficulties of adultshood—banality and mundanity.\nHe walked outside on the streets of Earth.\nThe [System] returned him.\nMatthew thanked him and found himself on the streets. The world was so slow.\nBut that was reality.\nIt was all so full and slow.\nEverything happened, and so many things happened.\nYet he was here, relaxing.\nThe sun was slow.\nHe looked around himself. It was the same old places.\nHe went home.\n“Ma?”\nInterlude (2) - Daydream 2 linkMatthew stared at the silence of the road.\nThe power vacuum that he had created in the other world was real.\nBut no one could fill it.\nMatthew closed his eyes.\nHe found himself meeting with a group of two women, Emma and Marianna.\n“How are you guys?” he said. He was not a loser in this world.\nIn fact, he was an accomplished fellow, but that didn’t matter.\nWhat mattered was family and friends in the end.\nMatthew embraced his siblings and parents before this.\nHe was here because he wanted to meet someone new. He was still afraid of talking to his closest friends.\nAccording to the date, nothing had changed since he came here.\nIn fact, when he came to, he was there at the dinner party.\nHe did not understand much, but he was beginning to step and walk slowly again, having always walked quickly.\nAfter speaking with Emma and Marianna, he closed his eyes.\nAnd he found himself on the street heading to a river. He rode a canoe and headed to a remote town where he climbed a mountain.\nHe climbed with his family, and they headed to an expensive coffee place.\nMatthew’s memories didn’t hesitate to hurt him.\nBut he didn’t hesitate to accept them.\nHe would become the epitome of grace and beauty.\nHe did not stop that feeling. It was a remnant from those days.\nA bite mark.\nAfter climbing the mountain, he found a rejuvenated sense of life.\nBut life was fast and slow. Each step and ache in his legs was normal.\nHe was used to exercising and working out. So he wasn’t that bothered.\nIt was very relaxing, while also being very painful.\nPhysically it hurt. But in his head, he was composed and knew he would bounce back soon enough.\nHe had a confidence and humility that he didn’t have when he was younger.\nThis world was beautiful.\nWhy did he ever hate it?\nDid he ever?\nHe didn’t remember.\nOh, his memories. . .\nThey’re fading. . .\nSophia?\nWho are you again?\nI don’t remember.\nI don’t. . .\nHello?\nWho’s there?\nAh, it’s me. I guess it’s been a while.\nHow have you been?\nFine, fine. How about you?\nI guess. . . How’s the life back there on that planet?\nFine. . .\nHow about you?\nMe?\nYeah. . . It’s been tough.\nI don’t know. . .\nI guess. . . It’s been very tough actually.\nDoes it matter who I am?\nHe sat down and watched the sun go by. . .\nHow long had it been?\nOnly four years.\nOnly!\nOnly. . .\nThat was enough to have that memory gone and good.\nWho was he again back there?\nWitchman? Matthew Cruz? I forgot the third one.\nI don’t remember. . .\n. . .\n. . .\n. . .\n. . .\n. . .\nIt was just a bubble in a big world, wasn’t it?\nLike highschool all over again. I genuinely thought it was this big place and everything was scary and big and slow and a struggle. But now that I’ve grown up, it’s all meaningless yet so meaningful. It didn’t really matter in the end. Yet it did.\nWithout highschool or his time at that planet, he would not have been able to be the person he was today.\nShould he be thankful?\nHe made the choice.\nPeople expected him to keep going.\nHe denied it.\nThat was saying no meant.\nDisappointing others and surprising himself.\nBecause life was a journey. And you never know what you’re going to get.\nOne bad day was all one needed.\nOne good day was all he needed.\nThe real world was never mundane so as to be boring, never banal to be so unentertaining, never ever comfortable so as to be complacent.\nHe found love and life in this world. He found a life worth living. He found excitement, joy, and in the darkest times, happiness.\nHe found that this world was all he needed.\nHe loved Earth.\nHe loved living here, and he never once thought that violence was the answer anymore.\nOnly when he was having a mental breakdown.\nBut the last time he had one was such a long time ago.\nThe breakdowns he had were mere tears.\nHe had so many activities, hobbies, friends, and family that he never felt the need to be anything else but himself.\nSo he found hope in the small moments.\nHe found ideals again.\nHe found what he didn’t see when he was back there in the world—the beauty of the everyday.\nAnd even now, he still felt he hadn’t appreciated it. There was still so much more to explore.\nHe was older now, but this world was so beautiful.\nHe couldn’t even describe it, and it would take forever before he could truly appreciate everything.\nBut everyday, when the clock struck a certain time, around night, and he was still awake, he got this feeling.\nHe wanted to become…\nHe was so excited to murder again.\nHe compressed his lips.\nHe sought therapy, and even with his hobbies, the lingering effects of trauma and being accustomed to violence never truly faded.\nHe was tainted, yet he believed that he was free.\nThis was freedom.\nHe would never deny it.\nHe would rather be here than there.\nHe grabbed his shirt and pulled it.\n“I have… to keep going… I have to…”\nHe closed his eyes and took a deep breath.\nHe resolved to keep going no matter what.\nHe was better than this.\nThe same way his spiraling came so suddenly due to his environment, his environment here was much more stable and contributive to a better mental state.\nHe wanted to learn how to eat food again.\nHis sister told him about this Japanese cafe, so he went there. She talked about her struggles as an adult and how she decided to break up with her fiancé becase she realized that all of this was not working. It was not sustainable. She and her fiancé had been in a relationship for a very long time, far longer than Matthew had been in that other world.\nSo he wondered what his past experiences brought to the table.\nAfter that, he began reading books as a way to get into a better mental state, since he was an avid reader after all.\nHe was too human, wasn’t he?\nHe killed so many, yet he was here relaxing.\nWho was he to change the narrative so quickly?\nWho was he to dare decide to do whatever he wanted and get away with it?\nHe was a disgusting thing.\nHe was so disgusting.\nHe did not deserve this shit.\nBut he had to keep living.\nHe would not stop now.\nHe could not stop himself from wanting to believe, trust, be kind, and keep going.\nHe disappeared.\nHe was not special anymore, but that was okay.\nHe never wanted to be.\nBut he did find himself much more confident and determined.\nHe was a lot more assertive, physically fit, strategic, and decisive. His past experiences in the other world helped him a lot, even while deteriorating his mental health.\n30 years passed, and he lived a very normal life.\nThe [System] was still present, and it honestly hated him enough that it gave him the chance to go back. It pretended as if he couldn’t go back for the majority of their time working together.\nBut Matthew was so ugly and stained in his eyes that he decided to get him packing his bags and leaving.\nMatthew\nChapter 76 linkMatthew looked at the ground. What was he doing? He had a daydream that he was back on Earth.\nHe remembered everything in that dream.\nWhat was he doing? How could the [System] possibly know a way to return him to Earth?\nThat dream… There was no way it was real.\nWhy would he give up this world just to go back?\nIt was too late.\nHe visited a goblin, who smiled at him.\nIt was too late for him to regret.\nHe walked down the wide and broad way that led to destruction.\nThe goblin gifted him another orb, showing him the path to the King of Mercy.\nLumi, Thorne, Elara, and the others disappeared under his influence.\nMatthew was making connections outside of Emerald Haven.\nKing of Mercy stared at him.\n"

                content: " A skeletal figure, draped in a purple robe, stands behind a market stall filled with jars and containers of various goods. The figure’s bony hand gestures towards the merchandise, suggesting a merchant or vendor. The setting appears to be an open-air marketplace with a simple cloth awning providing shade. The title, “Santo,” is prominently displayed in a stylized, gray font with a slight drop shadow, giving it a whimsical yet slightly eerie feel. Below the title, the tagline “Rattle \u0026 Craft - An Isekai LitRPG of Bones and Business” is presented in a clean, white, sans-serif font, offering insight into the story’s theme and genre, blending fantasy with entrepreneurial elements.\nBook Description:\nSanto was just your average office worker, drowning in spreadsheets and yearning for a life less ordinary. Then, a fateful accident grants his wish, but with a skeletal twist! Reborn as a lowly skeleton in a fantastical world, Santo despairs until he discovers a peculiar skill – the ability to animate objects with a touch of necromantic energy.\nArmed with this unusual skill, Santo embarks on a journey as a wandering merchant, crafting quirky companions and enchanted tools to sell across the land. Along the way, he encounters curious creatures, unravels the mysteries of his skeletal existence, and learns that even a bag of bones can build a thriving business… and maybe even find friendship in this strange new world.\n1:50 AM CET\nChapter 1 - Skeletons and Surprises linkSanto woke up in the morning, resting against his neat pillow, trying to stretch himself up out of bed. His sleep was mysteriously glorious, so he got this weird surreality after a good night’s sleep like he was lost and didn’t belong here. His dreams had been long and vivid, and now he was here sitting up on his bed.\nHe went to take a shower, never underestimating the power of a good cold bath. It had been years since he got a good cold bath after a good cold sleep.\nWaking up with that extra coldness made it difficult to take a good cold bath, but it was extra good.\nEverything was going to be great—the better word after good.\nHe went to work in his living room, waking up his gaming computer and just typing immediately since he left it on the source-code editor application he used last night.\nRelaxed, he tried resting his eyes after he tried pushing for a new personal project that really challenged his thinking. But he couldn’t do it while sitting on a chair in front of a screen.\nHe drank some good water and fell asleep.\nWhen he woke up, he found himself inside a room with soft walls similar to those in a large church. It was air-conditioned too. It looked like a fancier place to have a conference.\nHe noticed the only door in the room opening, making him jolt back.\nThe figure he came looked at him, staring for a while before tilting his head at the people behind him. It was a man wearing a brown jacket and red trousers. He said: “Hey guys, he’s awake. How do you guys even get people like these?”\nSanto then fell unconscious, and then he found himself on the grass.\n“Where am I?” he said, noticing the tropical rainforest all around him. “This isn’t…” His face accidentally brushed against vegetation, getting tickled and surprised.\nHe felt slightly nauseous, but it quickly faded, as if someone magically healed him.\nHe looked around and kept walking, finding himself at a river. “This isn’t… Where is it?” He was looking for a road.\nHe found a road. “There. That’s it.”\nIt wasn’t actually a road. It just looked like it. “Dang…”\nHe rubbed his mouth, as a wandering adventurer party emerged, sighting him.\n“Hello?” he mouthed and then repeated it in a loud voice.\nThe party noticed and asked why.\nSanto felt he didn’t know how to speak due to shock, but he tried anyway: “Where am I right now?”\nThe party glanced at each other and approached him. “We’re at Masu,” one of them said.\n“Masu? I don’t know… what’s Masu.”\n“Masu is here. You’re at Masu!”\n“Masu… I don’t know, sorry. I suddenly appeared here.”\n“Suddenly? Did you go here through a portal?”\n“Yes? I think so. Maybe.”\n“Then, you must be from the farther regions. The portals don’t reach this far anymore usually, because there’s really nothing around here for them. You’re at the beginning towns. There’s a journey you’re supposed to follow, so why are you here? Don’t you live there, and if not, haven’t you already gone past this point? You’re regressing?”\nSanto shook his head. “No. I don’t… know what you mean… I’m sorry.”\n“Don’t be. Be better.”\nSanto nodded pregnantly.\n“You can follow us. Come, come.”\nThe party led the way and showed him to the nearby village.\nSanto noticed something shocking. His fingers were slowly dripping away, the tips of which showed bones. What did this mean?\nHis body suddenly turned to a skeleton, and he teleported away to an underground dungeon.\n[You have successfully evolved into a lowly skeleton! You were moved to the dungeon! Check your stats!]\n[Evolution has made you weak! You get Evolution weakness, reducing your Max Health by 50!]\n“Interesting,” he said. “But why am I here?”\nNo answer.\nHe scratched his head.\nHe tried moving his arms and found it horrid. The experience of moving bones replacing his functional human limbs could be likened to living inside of a painting or dream for extended periods of time. And some of those dreams were scary.\nHe began walking.\nInside the cave, he had little to do with anything. It was empty and dark, and he could barely see. He didn’t even know how to navigate it, because it was so complex. Real dungeons were very wide, high, and cavernous that any loud movement would echo throughout. This was why he heard so many monsters right now.\nHe sighed and distracted himself by tapping his bones together. “What to do…” he muttered.\nHe picked up a rock and threw it.\n[You have killed a goblin! +10 XP!]\n[Level 0 -\u003e Level 1!]\n[Level 1: 0/15]\n“Huh?”\n“What does this mean?” He tried to do what he was told earlier, checking his stats.\nName: Spirit Santo\nSpecies: Lowly Skeleton (Grade ZZZ)\nAge: 20\nMindset: Weak and frail like a sociopathic bird\nLevel: 1 (0/15 XP)\nSkills: None\nSpells: None\nTitles: None\nProfession: None\nHealth: 450/450 (-50)\nMana: 0/0\nArmor: 30\nMagic Resistance: 24\nAttack Damage: 0 - 1\nStrength: 5\nDexterity: 5\nConstitution: 5\nIntelligence: 5\nWisdom: 5\nCharisma: 5\nStat points: 5\nProgress bars:\nBuffs: None\nDebuffs:\nEvolution weakness (-50 Max Health for 4:58:25)\nHe added his stat points to [Strength], not knowing what else to do with it.\n[As a result of your newfound Strength, your Attack Damage has increased: 0.5 - 1.5!]\n[Your sudden spike in Strength has made you weakened.

Miner]\nSanto smiled.\nHe tried smashing another rock.\nAnd he did it again and again until he had enough to carry in one palm. It wasn’t much really, but for now, it was good enough.\nHe brought them with him and walked away, passing by a group of skeletons who all looked a little confused at what this newbie was doing.\nOne of the skeletons said: “Hey, brother man, might we ask what you’re doing? Are you going to work as the hermit moles who take care of the food because the stones are used as fuel. Don’t do that. Follow us.”\nSanto nodded politely and dropped the rocks safely next to the cave wall.\nThe skeletons led him to a chamber where hundreds of monsters hanged out.\nSanto widened his eyes before he relaxed.\nNot a single goblin.\nIf one of the goblins was here, then him having killed the goblin would be disastrous.\nHe joined the skeletons in chuckling about something.\nHe had no idea what they were laughing about, but he was nervous.\nHe took his time for now.\nThe skeletons led him to a table where they sat down, as one of the skeletons went to the counter.\nThis skeleton got plates and put food on them one by one for the rest of the group.\nAfter he returned, Santo was starving somehow.\nThey began eating.\nIt was delicious food made from boring cows, but the dish was well-prepared.\nIt had cut onions, scallions, jalapeño, and beef all cooked separately and then added together in the final result.\nThe smell made him wrinkle his nose several times in desperation.\nWhen he ate it, his stomach noticed a change.\n[You have eaten your first dish of the day! +10 Health]\n[You have eaten with friends! +1 XP!

Take it?]\n[Yes.]\n[The skill will now be entering your list of skills.]\n[Since this is your first skill, do you want a tutorial?]\n[Yes.]\n[First, meditate. Second, release with a deep exhale. Third, raise your hand and aim it at your target.]\nSanto tried it, raising his hand first and then meditating and releasing with a deep exhale.\n[Animate Object has been cast!]\n[Animate Object hits Book!]\nThe book he hit got up on its own and looked at Santo.\nSanto glanced around. “What do you do?” he said.\nThe book shook his head and began opening its pages, showing him information about being a wandering merchant.\nSanto read it and got interested. “This is… How do I do this?”\nThe book shook as if shrugging.\nSanto realized that it meant that he had to be the one to find out himself.\nHe left and went up a flight of stairs in the common floor.\n[This staircase has been imbued with necromantic energy. It empowers you with Staircase’s Knowledge, which gives you +1 Intelligence for 1 minute!]\nHe kept going, finding a large gate.\nHe opened up.\n[Your level is too low to pass through here. Wait until you’ve leveled up.]\nHe went back down and looked for another way.\nHe found a tunnel that led to a small door.\nThe door opened by itself.\nA group of skeletons were standing inside an underground dungeon kitchen, cooking.\nSanto excused himself and left.\nHe went to another area and found only a group of goblins beating a skeleton.\nHe kept looking and looking.\nBut he couldn’t find the exit.\nHe realized that it would take a while before he would get out of here, so he sat down.\n[You are relaxed. Gained 1+ XP]\nHe realized that even idle actions gave me XP.\nHe wondered what else.\nHe tried doing jumping jacks, but nothing happened.\nHe tried running up and down the flight of steps again and again.\n[This staircase is troubled. It weakens you with Troubled Steps, which takes away +1 Intelligence for 1 minute!]\nHe stopped, feeling exhausted.\n[You are tired. Get some rest. You have 5 minutes until you are forcibly made to fall asleep.]\nHe lay down, passing out before the timer hit 4 minutes.\nWhen he woke up, he felt relaxed.\nBut he didn’t get the reward notification.\nHe kept looking around, seeing the shadows of a group of adventurers, including a wizard.\nAfter the adventurers left, he went along the path whence they came, finally reaching the surface.\nBefore doing so, he cautiously went to the library and got the book before leaving; though, he quickly rummaged the library for more books.\n[This book contains the skill Crafting. Take it?]\n[Yes.]\n[Your limit is one skill. Rejecting skill.]**\n[Book wants to be your list of skills. Take the offer?]\n[Yes]\n[Book will contain the rest of your skills.

Santo wasn’t a man or a beast like it said on the spell’s name.\n“Brown stuff!” the wizard cursed. “Wrong skill.”\nBefore Santo could understand what was going on, the wizard cast another skill: “[Lightning strike!]”\n[Lightning strike has dealt 0 damage due to the skeleton’s 100% Lightning resistance]\n“Blast it!” the wizard cursed again.\nHe looked for his items.\nSince the wizard took his time, Santo didn’t feel pressured at all. Though, since his life might be in future danger, he walked up and knocked him unconscious.\nThe wizard fell to the ground, his eyes spiraling with unconsciousness.\n[The wizard will gain consciousness in 72 seconds.]\nWell, since the wizard tried to kill him, Santo felt that it wouldn’t be too troublesome for him to take his stuff. Keepers peace-keepers, or something like that. He was actually referring to finders keepers, but whatever.\n[This book contains the skill Disguise.

Read it?]\n[Yes.]\n[The skill will now be entering your list of skills.]\nWhen the wizard awakened, Santo was long gone, having went into the heart of the town.\n“Oh, my goodness!” the wizard swore, scratching his head, looking around in distress.\nWhere would he get his next spell now!\nMeanwhile, Santo approached the town, using his two skills.\n[Disguise activated]\n[Night vision activated]\nThey didn’t take that long to activate, and they cost no mana, being permanently active. It was very simple like turning on an air-fryer or making a function in code.\nAt the village, he found that the town was mostly empty and weary, with little to no stalls around.\nHe wondered what the best thing to do here was, and from his many ideas, he thought it would be a cool idea to be a stall seller.\nThe idea [Mysterious Wandering Merchant] sounded like a cool path he could take. He was sure that there were titles like these because the book said so. He read it inside the book. Like it had actual words and stuff. The spell was often not even related to what was actually written. So he actually read it. It was cool. But he didn’t know the words.\nWait a minute. Imagine if it he could steal people’s stuff while they weren’t looking. Just kidding. He could be a mysterious thief. But he didn’t like stealing.\nEven though he was in his twenties, most of his life was easy and smooth, so he never really matured he felt. Everyone around him was so depressed and anxious, while he was just relaxing in his room coding silently like a good boy.\nMeanwhile, a man walked up to him.\n“What are you doing here?” he said. “Don’t you have manners? Wear your sandals!” He pointed like an Asian parent, placing his fingers against him.\nSanto was surprised to see someone noticing his bare feet. He realized that the disguise didn’t include clothes when it made him look human. He was still the naked skeleton but with a human body in the eyes of the man. That was awkward.\nThe good thing was he wasn’t actually naked, or human-naked. He was skeleton-naked! That was even better!\nHe told the man: “Where can I get these sandals?”\nThe man abruptly shifted from tension to friendliness, leading the way to a shop. “Here, Sir. This is free for you.”\nSanto was confused, but he followed him.\n[Accept Poor Man’s Sandals?]\n[Yes.]\nThe man said with a smile: “Thank you for taking it. My daughter has been wanting to share her creation for a while now.”\n“…”\nThe man smiled.\n“…”\nThe man smiled harder.\n“…”\nThe man grinned almost maniacally.\n“End conversation,” Santo said, hurrying away.\nHe mentally asked the [System] if he could change his sandals’ name.\n[Change Poor Man’s Sandals’ name?]\n[Yes.]\n[Pick a new name!]\n[Crazy Man’s Sandals.]\n[Success. Poor Man’s Sandals has been renamed to Crazy Man’s Sandals!]\nAs for where Santo had gone, he was sitting down in front of a large wagon at a small shelter from the rain.\n[Ride wagon?]\nHe looked around and noticed no one was around.\n[Yes.]\n[You are not the owner. Are you sure?]\n[Yes.]\nHe began riding it.\n[Because you are not the owner, this wagon will expire in 5 minutes.]\n[Since it’s your first time riding, tutorial?]\n[Yes.]\n[To move forward, first kick the horses. To avoid obstacles, lean left and right, and the horses will automatically understand. Then, to stop, shout at the horses to stop. They will stop if you’re loud enough.]\nHe obeyed the instructions and drove along.\n[A man is in the way. Dodge immediately!]\nSomeone was in the way he realized.\n[Strength Check Failed! Strength required: 30. Your Strength: 11.]\n“Dang it, dang it!”\nThe man got hit.\nSanto got down and asked the man if he was okay.\n[Charisma Check Success! Charisma required: 6. Your Charisma: 6.]\nThe man was okay, so he said: “Where did you learn how to drive… Wait a minute! That’s my wagon with that beautiful dent that I know so well! How dare you take it from me, you nut-brains rascal!”\nHe demanded Santo to compensate him by working under him.\nSanto asked what he would do.\n“You will help me sell!”\n[Merchant Albatross is offering you the job Merchant’s Apprentice! Take it?]\n[Yes.]\n“Come here, let’s go!” said Merchant Albatross.\nSanto followed, leaving behind the wagon.\nAlbatross glanced behind him before he was like: “Oh shoot, I forgot my wagon. I’ll pretend I was going this way anyway and get it, and then I’ll get mad at this new employee to deflect the blame to him. I’m so insecure, dang it!”\nWhen they rode the wagon, Albatross led them to a small shack nearby, putting down his stuff and setting up his shop by pulling a large drop-leaf table out and showcasing all his goods there.\nPeople immediately dropped by and bought items from him, showing their deep love for the goods the merchant showed.\nIn response, Albatross grinned with a laugh.\n[Acquaintance-maker +0.5 XP!]\nSanto didn’t understand it, but he thought it was fun.\n[The Customer wants to buy from you.

However, he did say that he could do something new. He told him that if he went down the road, he would find a plant-master, she would teach him how to take care of plants.\nSanto was disappointed, because he wanted to keep making pickaxes. For now, he was thinking of exploring new avenues.\nHe decided to take up Albatross’ suggestion and head down the road to the plant-master.\nWhen he was there, he didn’t see static plants that barely moved. He saw a bunch of plants fighting each other on the floor.\nThe plant-master, who he expected to be either an older woman or man, was a woman as young as he was, and she was cheering for both sides of a plant fight.\n“Hey!” Santo said. “What’s happening here!”\nThe plant-master stopped him with a gesture and said: “Watch! Look!”\nSanto looked at the plants. He saw that the plants were fighting and doing various different martial arts techniques. Their hands, arms, and legs, and body shape shifted around in rotation.\n“What’s this?” he said.\n“Just two weeks, I was able to get them to do this. Cool right?”\n“Cool? They suddenly became like this?”\n“Oh, no. That has been the case since my great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandmother. But I’ve finally updated them so that they do this.”\n“The martial arts?”\n“What’s that?”\n“The kicking and moving their arms and stuff.”\n“Oh, yeah, that’s right. That’s ‘martial arts’?”\n“Yeah…”\n“Oh, cool. I’ll call it that then. The ‘Martial Arts Update’!”\n“So what are their uses?”\n“Well, nothing much yet, but we’re a bunch of researchers first and foremost. And with the possibility of war, I feel that it is only right that we find new ways to make them stronger right?”\n“Was that the case for a long time?” he said.\n“What do you mean?”\n“Was the worry of war that long ago?”\n“Yeah!” she said.\nSanto left, not wanting to get too deep into the politics.\nThe chance at getting to learn more about the plant-master and her plants was lost in the process however, but Santo saw it as a worthy sacrifice.\nHe returned to Merchant Albatross, who said, “Good thing you’re here!

If he could set up a shop here, then maybe lots of people would buy. He wondered why no one set up shop here. Maybe the city were strict against street vendors here.\nHe returned home and slept at the time he wanted.\nHe woke up the next day and immediately arrived at the shop before Merchant Albatross.\nSeeing that he was early, Albatross later said that he was proud of his hard worker.\nSanto smiled, though he didn’t take the compliment too hard.\nHe planned on working through today to buy some pickaxes later.\nMerchant Seller (10/100 XP) -\u003e Merchant Seller (18/100 XP)\n[Acquaintance-maker +0.5 XP!]\n[Acquaintance-maker +0.5 XP!]\n[Acquaintance-maker +0.5 XP!]\n[Acquaintance-maker +0.5 XP!]\n[Acquaintance-maker +0.5 XP!]\n[Acquaintance-maker +0.5 XP!]\n[Acquaintance-maker +0.5 XP!]\nAcquaintance-maker (1.25/100 XP) -\u003e Acquaintance-maker (4.75/100 XP)\nAlbatross was slowly shifting the workload toward him, but for now, Santo only made up 20% of the work.\nThat means Santo could make more XP and gold coins.\n[Gold gained +1 (Albatross’ Apprentice)]\n[Gold gained +1 (Albatross’ Apprentice)]\n[Gold gained +1 (Albatross’ Apprentice)]\n[Gold gained +1 (Albatross’ Apprentice)]\n[Gold spent -1 (3 Wooden planks)]\n[Gold spent -1 (3 Wooden planks)]\n[Gold spent -1 (3 Wooden planks)]\n[Gold spent -1 (3 Wooden planks)]\n[The pickaxe you made was created.]\n[Miner +0.5 XP!]\n[The pickaxe you made was created.]\n[Miner +0.5 XP!]\n[The pickaxe you made was created.]\n[Miner +0.5 XP!]\n[The pickaxe you made was created.]\n[Miner +0.5 XP!]\n[The pickaxe you made was created.]\n[Miner +0.5 XP!]\n[The pickaxe you made was created.]\n[Miner +0.5 XP!]\n[The pickaxe you made was created.]\n[Miner +0.5 XP!]\n[The pickaxe you made was created.]\n[Miner +0.5 XP!]\n[The pickaxe you made was created.]\n[Miner +0.5 XP!]\n[The pickaxe you made was created.]\n[Miner +0.5 XP!]\n[The pickaxe you made was created.]\n[Miner +0.5 XP!]\n[The pickaxe you made was created.]\n[Miner +0.5 XP!]\n[Wooden planks: 0]\n[Wooden planks: 0]\n[Wooden planks: 0]\n[Wooden planks: 0]\n(It kept giving him that notification because he kept trying to make more.)\nMiner (2.25/100 XP) -\u003e Miner (8.25/100 XP)\nHe was slowly accruing more and more.

Come on look!”\nSanto saw a bunch of ducks inside. “What are they for?” he said.\n“They’re golden ducks! They give lots of gold!”\n“No, I’m pretty sure they’re supposed to be golden geese.”\n“No, look.” Albatross showed him a golden hoe. “They pooped this out!”\n“Ew. But how did they do it?”\n“I don’t know. But it’s awesome.”\n“You’re going to be selling this. So be careful. Some Customers will haggle for a better price for them. Don’t let them.

He had never seen stray dogs walking around where he lived back on Earth. They were always brought away immediately, so it was a rare once-a-year event when he was growing up.\nHe grew up in a gated community where many of the wealthy and famous lived, so he never knew the plights and friendships everyday people made with dogs.\nBut since he was here, why not?\nHe approached one of the dogs, but they bit him.\nThe dogs were rageful, and he could see that.\nHe felt empathy, because he knew that these dogs had suffered long and hard for them to be so aggressive, given that they were street dogs.\nHe told them that it was okay and left. He didn’t need to win.\nHe only needed to prepare for what would come next, because underlying the joys of everyday life was the heavy hammer of fate.\nLater, nearby, roars poured through the streets, as hundreds of soldiers began employing the houses and buildings to use as housing.\nEven if they were the town’s soldiers, they were heading to war.\nReturning to Santo, he didn’t really want to deal with that, so he hid inside the Albatross’ shop and told Albatross what they could do.\nAlbatross said he wanted to go out and do something and that if Santo wanted to hide, he could do so at his “own risk.”\nSanto nodded.\nAfter 10 hours passed, nothing happened, and Santo had gotten bored and fallen asleep.\nWhen he woke up, his back ached. He had never slept that long, and it was probably because of how comfy Albatross’ bed was.\nHe had been sleeping on the bed inside the shop.\n“So what are we going to do next?” he wanted to ask Albatross.\nBut Albatross was not there. The soldiers were still outside in formation.\nSanto shrugged. It was late afternoon already, but he was still up to sell.\n[The Customer wants to buy from you.

Will you sell the golden hoe to them?]\n[No.]\nMerchant Seller (28/100 XP) -\u003e Merchant Seller (38/100 XP)\n“This is good enough,” he said to the customers as he closed the shop, telling them that they would get an exclusive discount for waiting anyway.\nHe was actually going to get out of his own money this time. Why did he do this?\nWell, he saw a mother and child, a youth that looked troubled and stressed, and a group of farmers that were talking to each other and waiting patiently only to get declined when the time came for them to buy.\nHe felt sorry for them, but this was also his way of bringing back some good to the community and cultivating loyalty. If the 14 customers who were declined bought twice more, then that could lead 100% increase in sales, considering that they got 100 customers everyday and the discount was 50%. Well, they didn’t all buy the same items, and not all the items had the same price. Therefore, his calculation was likely off by a lot; however, it was a good way to see the sales trajectory for deceivingly simple actions.\nHe was a senior coder after all. It was his job to know suboptimal ways of getting the same result in order to teach juniors the optimal way. And what better way to start applying this concept by gauging a sales trajectory? His coding skills were not useless outside coding after all, he thought jokingly.\nThe next day, he saw Albatross at the shop again, but for some reason, the good dude looked distressed. “What’s wrong?” Santo said.\n“They took my wife and kids away,” Albatross said with a grave voice.\n“What?” Santo, who had been thinking about irrational coding and numbers earlier. “No way. That doesn’t make sense.”\n“Well that’s what they did okay!”\n“Oh, okay then. I guess soldiers do that? What’s the logic?”\n“I don’t know! I don’t know! I’m thinking of doing it…”\n“Doing… what?”\n“‘It’…”\n“‘It’?”\nSanto continued, “I don’t understand.”\n“I’m going to end it all—”\n“Hey, hey, don’t say that. Is it a normal thing? What’s their basis? Is there some law or what? There must be a reason why they’re doing this. I’ve never seen soldiers do bad things before. They’ve always been protecting me.” He was referring to his life back on Earth.\n“What the hell are you talking about?” Albatross was visibly enraged. “Stop saying this.”\n“No… you’re not making sense. I thought you had it altogether. But you look lost.”\n“Of course I look lost! What are you? A noble?”\nSanto felt offended. “No… not necessarily—”\n“Well, shut up okay?”\nSanto hated being looked down like this. Just because he had it easy didn’t mean he had it easy. Things were difficult for him too, and Albatross was being unreasonable. Santo was calm because he knew how to be patient, but Albatross was being very unreasonable.\nSanto decided to leave.\n[Acquaintance-maker -60 XP!]\nAcquaintance-maker (4.75/100 XP) -\u003e Acquaintance-maker (-55.25/100 XP)\n[You have lost Acquaintance-maker! You will not be able to gain it back in 55.25 days as a penalty!]\n[Due to losing Acquaintance-maker, you will also get Callousness, reducing empathy by 60%!]\nHe made sure to bring nothing. He could have sold the pickaxes, but he didn’t know how to. And he was too frustrated to try while Albatross was still there.\nHis pride was hurt, but he had a good reason okay?\nHe decided to travel. He didn’t need entitled toxic people who thought they could get whatever they wanted. People needed to work hard for what they wanted, and Albatross was clearly one of those people who blamed others instead of owning up for what they did wrong—victim mentality. The soldiers would never hurt anyone unless it was for a reason. What was the logic in kidnapping a wife and a child? Albatross and his wife did something wrong.\nReturning to the moment, though he was bothered, he still had his golden handknife to protect his items in case he needed to.\nBut it was one-time use, so he had to be careful.\nHe planned to keep working as a merchant, since it was clearly a good way to accrue XP in a safe way. He didn’t want to get entangled with politics or unreasonable people.\nMeanwhile, a familiar wizard encountered him, casting: “[No Man Nor Beast Shall Ever Through These Lands Ever Again]!”\n“You haven’t learned your lesson, have you?”\nThe spell hurt him this time, because he was using his human disguise.\nHe fell to the ground hard, his head dizzy and nauseous. “What… what was that?”\n“Ha, you should have killed me when you had the choice.”\n“‘Chance’, you mean?”\n“What?”\nSanto was only pretending to be weak. He struck the wizard on the head and knocked him to the ground, controlling him with his boney body. He removed his disguise, revealing the skeleton underneath. “You and that other guy are the same kind!” he shouted, scaring the wizard due to the deep, monstrous voice.\nThe wizard was left alive, but he was too frozen to do anything, tears dripping down his face and repeating “I’m sorry,” with closed eyes.\nSanto was not any ordinary man.\nHe was… a skeleton.\nHe returned and asked the man how he could set up a stall for people to buy, still using his intimidating voice.\nThe man nodded and said, “There’s a spot around here. It’s called Don’s Way, and if you stay there, many adventurers will come, I promise.”\n“‘I promise’? That sounds not true.”\n“I promise, I promise—I’m being real, I’m being real!”\n“Okay then. Where’s the way? What direction?”\nHe pointed south. “…there…” His hand pointed toward a mountain range.\n“How do I get there huh?”\n“The ridges are Don’s Way.”\n“Oh, so you want me to die, huh?”\n“No! No! I’m just saying that I can lead you there.”\n“Me? There?”\n“Yeah. I know the path, and since you’re strong and pretty human too, I thought we can work together.”\n“Really?” He glared at the man in case he was lying.\nSanto returned to normal: “Then, let’s go. I want to set up a merchant stall now. What’s a good meal to make?”\n“Ah, bibingka. I heard people buy it. Cheese sticks as well.”\n“Mmh. Sounds pretty good.” He couldn’t make facial expressions, but if he could, he would be smiling until the corners of his lips reached his ears.\nThe wizard stood up with his staff and then fell, slamming his head against the dirt due to a tree root.\nSanto furrowed his brow, frowning. As the wizard pretended to be unconscious, Santo’s face slowed changed, a smile appearing, before he burst into gleeful laughter.\nMaybe it was because of his responsibilities in this new world, but he couldn’t just play around like a child anymore.\nHe was going to take this world on, and if he had to team up with old enemies, then so be it.\nIn the meantime, in Santo’s hand, the book had been quiet for a while, but it was listening the whole time.\nSomething sparked in its heart. Unlike many pets, it longed to become more. Like the Fallen Angel, it envied God’s power.\nThe book wanted to conquer Santo’s position. Their friendship, albeit short, had been sweet, but it would come to an end and make the way for a new dynamic, one shared by two different points of view.\nSanto stood; the book stayed tucked in his hand; and the wizard stood up, sauntering feebly behind Santo.\nWhen they reached Don’s Way, Santo waited for a while, and they didn’t find anyone at first.\nBut with time, adventurers began coming. The wizard was right.\nThe book began walking around nearby, lying down next to a rock. Santo warned it about the elements as per usual. But the book didn’t like anything that Santo said, only complying outwardly.\nAnd that was when Santo began selling nothing.\n“I have nothing to sell. I forgot my stuff.”\n“Oh, shoot, you went all the way here and forgot.”\nInstead of getting frustrated like Albatross, he laughed it off. “Well, I guess we’re going back.”\nThe wizard stood still, watching Santo walk back silently. A lot of emotions hid behind that contemplative and considerating look of his.\nThe book jumped in Santo’s hand, and the three went on their way back home.\nLater, they brought Santo’s older pickaxes and prepared to sell them.\nStats Spoiler:\nName: Spirit Santo\nSpecies: Lowly Skeleton (Grade ZZZ)\nAge: 20\nMindset: I need to get stronger.

                content: "Chapter 1 - Laborer link Author’s Note\nStay and rest awhile. This is going to be a long ride. I may fine-tune published chapters as I go, but the main idea is there: how limited one narration is yet how wide everyday actions influence society. I am narratively restoring the power back to the people by emphasizing how much power an individual holds amid war and terror. It’s third person omniscient point of view, so be warned. Here are some observations about the style of this book: very detailed and vivid descriptions, especially of settings, characters’ appearances, and actions; lots of detail about the fictional world, almost like a history book mixed with fiction; combines standard prose with scripts and scientific writing at times; and shifts perspective between different characters to advance the plot and provide insights into their thoughts/motives. It will feel like a long car ride where one’s head is in a constant cycle of reflection with slight motion sickness maybe, but with the overall feeling of curiosity and stillness. Imagine yourself at the top of a mountain, sitting down all alone. You may lie there for 1,000 metaphorical years, listening to ambient music; that is the length of the book. This book focuses on narrative rather than gimmicks like outrageous or silly premises, genre shifts, exaggerated caricatures or archetypes used for humor or shock value, instant gratification through deus ex machina, and random events used just to surprise the reader. If there are instances of sudden boosts, it is foreshadowed before hand, using resources already established long before. Gratification needs to feel earned. Expect everything to fall apart in the pursuit of everything, after I edge my way through the details.\nVersion History Page (Github Commits Page)\nWhen it came to the idea of visions, one laborer saw a bright light shining in the horizon. As for what it meant, it said: “Don’t go to work today.” Regarding his response, he used a sense that this light was guiding him as a promise of good luck. Though, this vision was imaginary. In conclusion, despite all this imagination, he embodied the everyday laborer who wanted to return home and procure a fresh drink.\nTransitioning to a formal standpoint, the beast, the environment, would always make the man. To tie this to the laborer, he was a good case in point.\nAccelerating to a more mechanical level, the laborer was marching in a large city between a point A and a point B. Moreover, surrounding him, buildings were sectioned into the residential areas, the government offices, the barracks, and the wilderness, among others; all of this within the confines of this city. To put it simply, his environment was more than capable of addressing needs and functions, provided it had access to resources and manpower.\nSwitching to schedules and dynamics, the current events unfolding in the laborer’s life all occurred on a significant day 1. As for what this meant, its significance would be revealed later at least.\nShifting view to his actions, he was picking up a defined number of bags at point A and walking over to point B to drop them. Moreover, the distance between point A and B ran across the city. Furthermore, point B was located at the city gate, while point A was located in the wilderness where a cave entrance leading to a dungeon was. In short, the worker played a role in this infrastructural process.\nTurning to a more vivid note, the environment was screaming with life in so many ways. To show some examples, five scenes came to mind. First, the sound of fresh wind maneuvered through the streets of the city like a man breaking a melon skillfully with his fingers all on their own and each acting independently. Second, the calling of two children echoed through the streets cavernously. Third, the darkness of clouds provided depth in various areas, highlighting the insufficiently lit parts of the city, showcasing its disparity of lights. Four, the compensation of the torch bearers in their quest to bring light to the darkness was a pillar of the city. Lastly, the loud noises of babies in the night time preceded the soothing humming that ran through the windows. In the end, the sound of wind, the calls of children, the dark clouds, the torch bearers’ roles contributed to the scream of the environment.\nAs for the relationship between the vivid complexity of his environment and the laborer, he dealt with it by restricting himself within a simple veneer. Additionally, in it, his face and his smile, and, by extension, the characteristics of his appearance became locked in place as a way to assert his independence across a field of dynamics. Third, his appearance, particularly his face and smile, was a mechanism employed in navigating an ever-complexifying world. Overall, the city and the environment were him.\nIn contrast, his face was a minor indicator of him as a person. To phrase this in a more nuanced manner, it was primarily a fleeting look into a moment of him; though, it could be everything at that moment. To sum, his face briefly revealed him, but it might be most crucial at that moment of reveal.\nMoving forward to the aesthetic side of his person, he had three other non-environmental attributes that dictated in some way who he was. First, his clothes were trimmed awkwardly like a mess of sewing equipment on a muddy floor. Second, his eyes were sorrowfully green like a faint gem gasping for breath. Finally, the parts of his breath was like a moment’s embrace, as they danced through the gaps in the wind’s strength like a pervasive disease seeking entrance into peoples’ gaping mouths. Moreover, the particular vividness of this list of attributes reflected how he perceived himself. However, it was also how his role models and peers perceived him to varying extents as influences to his personality. To conclude, the aesthetics were critical in understanding him because of how he and others perceived them rather than some inherent value that they might hold.\nManeuvering to a broader, metaphorical level, a timely drip of rainwater would open up a grand line of a hurricane of peoples from across the land. In addition, in this line, where the city hugged itself, the young man was present. At the end of the day, he was part of something big.\nScaling down to the concerns of the everyday level, this young man, Maverick, heard from his co-workers that it was arranged for him to be the one handling more than his usual set of bags today, but he wanted nothing to do with it, even after pondering the idea for a moment. Eventually, he said, “I really shouldn’t go to work today.” All things considered, he resolved to take the day off.\nIncidentally, the urban streets accomodated his form as one among hundreds of fairgoers in a city, each individual holding above their heads a busy calendar. To encapsulate, this scene illustrated the blend between the city and the fairgoers, each expressing a certain calendar-pertaining hurry.\nAnyway, he concocted a plan to avoid work by hiring a young clueless boy in order to fill in for him. As for the boy’s background, he came from the slums, a willing laborer with a family of his own. From what Maverick heard, the boy enjoyed apples. Finally, he showed motivation and an obedient spirit, two out of three traits for success.\n“Okay, Mr. Boy,” said Maverick. “I should be Maverick, but you, today, are going to be me, right? That’s cool, right? So we—” Also, he glanced past a few passersby at the boy, waiting to see if the boy was willing to fine-tune his plan, correct him, or provide any sort of resistance toward his communication structure, for which he opened up a spot in his overt hesitation. To sum up, he was testing him, hoping to grasp that last trait for success—proactivity.\n“Should I wear a mask, Mr. Sir?” interrupted the boy, moving out of the way of passersby, wanting to get a more definite understanding of Maverick’s plan. As for the context behind this, he only got a brief explanation regarding the mission earlier, but he wasn’t one to waste an opportunity to question. As for why he used double titles of courtesy, as seen in “Mr. Sir,” it was intended to emphasize his respect for a fruitful collaboration with Maverick in the context of the mission. In essence, he wanted to get to know Maverick better as was practical.\nShifting to Maverick, he said: “No, no, we don’t want that yet. But… Ah, whatever. You’re going to wear it later… anyway. In fact, you’re also going to be doing awesome things, so be!” In addition, he giggled, sidestepping out of the way of passersby, excited at the potential the boy had in becoming much more assertive. To elaborate his process of thought, he intentionally hid information because he wanted to see if the boy was capable of flexibility and adaptability in meeting Maverick on the same playing field. In addition, he was prepared for all of them to lose everything today, but he would make sure that the boy was resilient enough to handle any mishaps or unexpected challenges. To sum, Maverick tested the boy’s adaptability and resilience, eager for his assertiveness to grow.\nSo instead of watching the boy rhythmically like the mechanical fluttering of the golem, Maverick stood still, beside a group of passersby temporarily discussing in place regarding an event. Then, he went along with the plan, taking quick steps and waiting for the boy to do something. To wrap his actions up, it was all one disassembly: if the boy did something, this would spur things forward.\nWhen the boy did nothing and glanced only at the passersby, Maverick abruptly put a mask on him, recognizing that he was missing that one essential completing trait. Anyway, this mask would make it so that it was challenging for the task masters to check him since the streets reeked of disease and dirt enough to disable their sense of smell as well. In the end, the interplay of the mask and the boy’s failure involved an exchange. Furthermore, Maverick’s withheld information would only be unneeded package for the boy who showed no sign of the willingness Maverick was looking for.\nCompleting the departure from Maverick and the boy’s dynamic and journeying to the task masters, these brutes were known to be very careful when it came to direct physical touch. This was one reason why they often used an outranging whip. Hence, the task masters posed a tangible threat to Maverick’s side.\n“Don’t ever cut ties with me, don’t leave me because I’m lonely little piece of shit,” mocked the task master managing Maverick once in the past to him and his laborer teammates. “We aren’t gonna let you take a little pedestal and say, ‘Na-na-na-na-na! Not today, okay? Whatever imagines you got. Please put them in a little dust bin, and put them out… right now.” Also, the context behind his unusual phrases could be explained. To conclude this snippet, “Cut ties with me” meant “act detached and only pretend to listen,” and “imagines” was just another way of saying “imaginations.”\nWith the task masters’ threat clear, Maverick prepared effectively. This involved the boy’s mask disguise being natural since the man regularly wore one.\nNow, he couldn’t afford for the boy, his deputy, to get caught. Naturally, to prevent this, he hired two more deputies to act as reserves and watch in case the first one couldn’t take the pressure. All in all, his preparation response had one more prong to it.\n“I have the best plan,” said the first boy, Notch, and this straightforward assertion was pivotal in convincing the two boys.\nCoincidentally, he greeted a group of older acquaintances smiling at him.\nIn any case, with the two new boys on board, they would—according to consensus—switch with the boy, as they were close in height.\nAfter politely excusing myself toward an older lady passing by, Maverick looked at them, making them feel that he was sure. But he just had that look of confidence plastered on his face.\n“Hey, what if we fail?” said the oldest among them, Billy, counterbalancing the confident mood, as he snuck a glance at a pair of women his age.\n“Huh,” said Notch, not knowing what to say since he was a doer rather than a thinker. Even with this, the boys proceeded calmly and even excitedly. Additionally, while he put his hand to his face with thought, he accidentally bumped into a passerby and excused himself, smiling politely when the passerby assured him that it was fine.\nReturning to the height strategy, Maverick would have already returned to his place, re-attaching the mask. Should a decision to check behind it come through, it would fall under the jurisdiction of the task master.\nAfter Maverick led the boys to the place of interest where the task master was, the task master present, Sprutnoa, said: “I will kill a piece of crappy ninny today if none of you do something with your life. Strike up!” To clarify, “strike up” meant “going above and beyond expectations.”\nAfterwards, since they got the confirmation that it was time, Maverick and the other two boys left Notch before Sprutnoa noticed them.\nShifting to the broader workflow, the journey would last only about 30 minutes, so the boys would need to be very quick when it came to switching if the time came.\nAt the moment, the first boy, Notch, finally introduced himself into the system of laborers, glancing briefly at a noisy group of passersby to avoid looking too attentive or too curious.\nLater, during the journey, in an area where only a few passersby could be seen at the distance, the task master did show suspicion, but that was toward another laborer, who said “Hey, may—”\n“Shut it,” said Sprutnoa, smirking as if he said the funniest thing. “Is that how you should be speaking to me? Know your place? Okay?” Furthermore, his voice was sarcastic, as if he was saying the most obvious thing. “If you really don’t like the intentional mood, why don’t take a understanding test and believe in yourself that this entire thing you’re doing is a big fucking joke. It’s actually… According to the hierarchy of things and knowledge, it is utterly pointless, and philsophically, it’s stupid. You know, according to Mr. Soaks—the greatest philosopher of all time—it’s like the most disgusting little ick. Heh? Just a little bang-bing-bung man waiting patiently to be destroyed, to be crushed by the real, awesome world where the awesome people take position and be awesome in the most awesome way. Look at your friends. They’re cool! They got the skills to match up with their incredibly hateable personalities! They have the understanding of the entire world, isn’t that right? But you? You are so incredibly smart too! You! So awesome and beautiful! Hahahaha! It’s like I’m looking at me past self. Oh, wait…! I wasn’t like you. No. Even better. I was so awesome, more, more, more, more! I was better than you in every single way. Do you get me? Do you have the understanding that understanding getting me? That’s so cool!” To repeat, he was being very sarcastic.\nHis face turned stone-faced, and his voice became deadpan. “Just shut up and move on, okay? I’m not answering any of your questions.\n“Do you understand?\n“Listen.\n“Okay?”\nAfterwards, after Sprutnoa repeatedly provoked him, the laborer couldn’t bear it any more and took it out on him.\nSpecifically, he dove, raised his fist, and slammed the task master. The notion that any task master could be beaten impinged upon the power of every task master, so he was pressured to make an example out of the young laborer.\nOverall, the dive marked the start of the fight between the laborer “Inframark” and the task master Sprutnoa.\nTo begin with, Sprutnoa ran his fist into Inframark’s arm, smirking.\nAs for the third exchange, Inframark kicked, while Sprutnoa used his elbow.\nAltogether, it was a messy, sloppy fight.\nSprutnoa got a kick on Inframark’s more vulnerable side, his hands creating distance between them.\nInframark fell to the ground, the drag and impact of the fall reducing his agility by a significant amount.\nSimultaneously, Sprutnoa wheezed, struggling to breathe, which made him appear vulnerable and put pressure on the clock. Moreover, he loosened his arms to escape a muscle ache.\nInframark got up and shot his fist against Sprutnoa’s elbows.\nA second later, Inframark grabbed Sprutnoa’s wrists and kicked him.\nBefore a series of punches, the laborer’s kick unintentionally served as a feint and delivered his whole back into his swings, so Sprutnoa twisted his body to mitigate the damage even further.\nWhen Inframark huffed to breathe and loosened his grip slightly, Sprutnoa forced Inframark away, hitting the the laborer on the left shoulder.\nInframark slowed down and paused before backing away and squatting down, supporting himself with his palms on the ground.\nSprutnoa lifted his leg for a kick before he dropped it.\nFinally, Inframark was lying on the ground, breathing heavily, too exhausted to fight. When Sprutnoa came close to keep fighting, Inframark raised his arms in submission, repeating that he couldn’t fight anymore. Afterwards, the fight was over in a way that left both fighters dissatisfied yet strangely relieved, as if fighting allowed them to be honest for once. But they were not conscious of this fact or symbolism, too tired to deliver a speech and analyze themselves. They only felt the mixed feelings that came after an intense fight with someone one knew well, needing time to process what happened. For now, they could only bear with the physical pain until it subsided. Only then, they could engage in introspection.\n“What was the point?” Sprutnoa said, putting on a smile before a serious look took over.\n“Why fight? Tell me. I don’t understand it. Really. And everyone that has been pretending for so long. I’m not saying you’re not doing something possibly potentially maybe awesome in some way or manner. I’m just saying why. Why do it? Why be so sure of yourselves and put yourselves in danger unnecessarily? You know, make an actual life? Do you recognize that the only way we’re moving forward is through reality? Real things, actually caring, actually doing something, and being real. You are really not much of an actual ’tryer’ (trier), are you? In fact, you are completely and utterly devastated. You’re an actualy no-brainer with the only thing backing up is being an absolute lost cause. And I’m not saying— I’m not saying you’re a loser… or you’re hateable in some way or ‘matterble’ (manner). I’m saying that that’s all you’ve been putting yourselves to, committing yourselves towards. It’s ineffective. Let’s be honest. Like, let’s just not. Let’s be real. Let’s be real. How about you actually think for a second? Be clearly, really, truly. I am not guy. I am not that guy. I am merely a representation of what must be and what has to be in order to sensify things into an actual state of, of reality. We are told to let it go and be the people who do the right things while… In the meantime, other people, you know what they do, you know what they do? They throw themselves onto a bed, and they cry. Do you get it? Do you really get it? Is it there in your hair (head)?” In addition, he scanned the laborers’ reactions, who looked subdued rather than motivated. In response, he added, “Let’s be clear. Not a bunch of lost causes or ’tussle tons’. We are truly and utterly completely real, right? Not, not, not, not this. Not this little disgusting little thing. No! Absolutely not!”\nConsequently, the laborers turned around to return to work. Following this, Sprutnoa raised his hand and halted them.\nShifting to a more straightforward level, Sprutnoa said, extending a polite, reassuring smile toward passersby that had raised their brows in concern: “If you really tried, oh gosh. If you really did? You’d be a winner! Yeah! I want to create the winner state, not people who push themselves into a pit of hell. [I want to] tussle with the people who actually try, not clenched a-holes who put their little disgusting little things in a twist every golly dong ding day! This is the honest truth: best you be putting yourselves in an actual place of honesty and look real hard at the reality that is governing us today. We need to be actual human beings, you know. And, and, and I really do trust that you guys can do it. You know what must be done. You guys know that you guys can wield it. And now, go onwards! Work hard for what you want instead of [being] an actual loser! I am not saying that everyone’s fine and no one’s crying in the dark. I’m just saying that people suffer. That’s normal. That’s real. That’s everyone. I struggle everyday to give a family who has no care or damn about my existence. I do put myself available in an available manner for just a tiny bit of care. But decline! No! Look at me! I am an utter dipshit. Put down, crushed under a rock. I am lost. But do you see mwah-mwah-mwah-mwah-mwah (crying)? No! I do what I do because I have a choice and I chose to do the right thing because of love and because nothing in the world matters… Even if! Even if I have been tossed and turned by those whom I have given my spirit and history of life toward. It’s so…” He frowned suddenly, his eyes falling simultaneously. “It’s just my life… hehe!” he said in a mocking tone, as if he was mocking Life itself. “That’s the, that’s the reality. Now, just believe yourselves, and be honest. Face the truth. Face it, you little limp dick cowards! Move! And be something for once in your life” Although his usual grit returned, it was mixed with an underlying grief. Moreover, he was saying this not only to the laborers but to himself as a mantra-reinforcing reminder. “If you can’t be honest and realize that when I was trying to tell you something, I’m not being mean. I’m being honest. I’m being a real honest human being like no [one] like you would ever have. So either you change your life for the better, recognize the truth. Or can you please go home and cry like a little limp-dick victim and be a loser… forever, crying, sitting down, begging, praying, shitting, sitting, meaning nothing. Do you understand? Do you want to feel something for once, or do you want to do nothing?” He laughed genuinely and with a pattern of nostalgia and self-teasing.\nMeanwhile, the shadow of Sprutnoa fell over Notch, whose eyes looked shaken behind his mask, but he dared not show fear ostentatiously like a peacock.\nAt the sight of Notch, Sprutnoa with concern and newfound calm: “Are you okay? Look, I’m sorry if that you made you feel weird, Maverick. See everyone, look at Maverick. This person, this human being, despite everything, performs the best and is a honest-to-God person. This proves that he’s not pretending despite all of the feelings, and if he is, then his emotions and his truthfulness of real life should at least show that he’s not here to make a fucking joke. He’s here for you to acknowledge that you have to try harder. Hmm-hmm! That’s what you have to do. You have to try.\n“But, look, look, oh look! This loser limp-dick piece of shit does not have the capacity to look and believe and feel and empathize with hope and beauty, he is lost, he is not present. He’s gone!” He was referring to the laborer he had just beaten.\nIn simple terms, Notch found his expectations of himself raised, while the laborer saw his falter. As for Sprutnoa, he saw himself as “justified.” After all the good things he had gone through and the good people he had met, there was no way that anyone would defy his humanity and all the people who had been kind to him. No one would make their lives meaningless through their callousness toward him. They would not break the humanity that those people who had helped him had. Accordingly, he was justified and the epitome of grace and beauty.\nThus, the journey began, and the time ticked, 30 minutes remaining.\nAs for his response to the remaining time, the boy counted his steps.\nIn the meantime, while several laborers whispered behind Notch, one of them spoke too loud. This was due to a growing discontent with the task master’s actions that overburdened the armrests of victory. To make it clearer, he was Inframark, the sibling of the laborer who had lost to the task master earlier.\nWhen it came to the sibling, he sternly warned Inframark to “quiet down and take a gaudy look” at the mission. To explain, his use of “gaudy” in “gaudy look” emphasized a critical examination to the point of looking gaudy. Though, it stemmed from an ancient confusion between “gaudy look” and “take a gander at”.\nAnyway, the reason for the warning was the imminent arrival of a taskmaster.\nNonetheless, Inframark cursed task masters with frustration, adding the proverbial statement “No masters!”\nDespite the task master’s initial awareness, he brushed off Inframark’s expressions as childish and bombastic.\nFrom his point of view, he heard a very brief, high-pitched whine in the distance, stopped, and turned around to do his usual look-around. By this point, his head was turned away from the laborer.\nImmediately, without thinking, the laborer attacked the task master in the eyes from behind, alerting the other laborers to stay out of the way.\nSubsequently, his adrenal gland responding more readily due to regular exercise, the task master threw out a curving, extended strike, hitting the laborer on the forehead to stun or distract him rather than do heavy damage. This was in succinct preparation for his follow-up heavy hitter, the whip, in a combatant breakdown.\nEventually, when the task master’s whip fell, the laborer hit the ground, his cheek burning. Similarly, the task master cringed backward, covering his burning eyes.\nMeanwhile, the laborers began to feel the natural course of the confrontation die down in expectation of a clean repression of insubordination.\nNevertheless, wanting to break out of the small world he was in—society, the only thing he knew—the laborer ran.\nMoreover, screaming furiously, he cocked his head back defiantly only to see the eyes of Sprutnoa staring at him with a neutral expression, the kind that implied disappointment and disillusionment.\nMeanwhile, unbeknownst to everyone, the surrounding woodland began to grow louder and louder with roars and cries.\nThen, Notch saw the terrified expressions of the two other boys who were leaving him. But the silhouettes of beasts emerged, striding closer and closer.\nFinally, Notch recognized that today was going to be the best day of his life, because he would win. Second, he prepared everything for this moment: all his life’s experiences amassed. Third, his skills were divinely favored. Fourth, he knew it, as he would sometimes talk about how he would not freeze up in this situation. Fifth, he would instead avoid a beast’s attacks and treat it like a dog, playing catch with it. Sixth, once he beat a beast, he would receive the greatest rewards.\nSo he was excited, hardening his fist, tensing his outgoing, athletic legs. Furthermore, since he was the most favored here in terms of plan and preparation, he was already on the move.\nLater, as soon as the beast jumped out, Notch was standing in the way, realizing his body and his mind were on two opposite ends of the spectrum, leaving him frozen in place. Metaphorically, it was like staring at the birds in the morning or walking around for breakfast. Even after everything, the will of his body was not on his side this time.\nSimultaneously, the task master was quick, slashing the beast and kicking it to the ground with a spinning swirl. “Purge the weak!” he said from all the adrenaline.\nShifting to conclusive context behind Sprutnoa as a person, he wanted to ensure that Notch, whom he thought was Maverick, and the other laborers were safe, but he was already trying to prepare himself to push away the grief that would result from the death of a laborer. In other words, he had to be strong, he couldn’t just sit still and watch, and he had to keep going because no one deserved to be hurt.\nAs for the relationship between his role as a strict, provocative task master and himself, six concerns could be identified. One, he had a sense of obligation to be honest with his values and conviction. Second, being a task master was merely a role that he felt that he needed to embody, blurring the lines between his more polite self and his aggressive role. Third, he really did care about others. Fourth, he didn’t want to hurt people, but he wasn’t going to pretend that he was perfect. But he had to keep trying. Fifth, he couldn’t pretend or be complacent. Lastly, he had to keep improving himself, so today, he had to give his all into stopping the beasts, whatever it took, even if it might make him look weak or unmanly.\nAdditionally, he was the epitome of grace and beauty, and he was justified in protecting those he cared about because people mattered. And divinity could only do so much, as even as a random human trying to reconcile the power and the attendant responsibilities and expectations that a task master entailed, he would become everything to help them at this very moment, even if it meant losing himself in the process. If people saw what he saw, they would see beauty in the everyday level and believe in the potential of people, even simple laborers whom people dismissed as nothing. But they weren’t nothing, and he would do everything to help them gain the respect they deserved. But he wasn’t going to pretend that they were perfect either. In the end, he could only hope for someone with the same grit and passion he had rather than some manchild characterized by an interplay of cynicism, undeveloped empathy, and a victim mentality reigning over his head. To answer possible criticism, his sarcastic provocations were meant to dismantle the pride, arrogance, complacency, and callousness, among other associated negative traits, that he often saw brewing in those who had not developed a taste for beauty. As for how provocatively he responded to the question to the laborer, he did that because the laborer was the kind to ask questions constantly without using his brain, often repeating himself when the situation called for independence through self-reflection, observation, and initiation with other laborers rather than the fostering of overdependence onto authority figures who could only afford the time to micromanage so much.\nIn short, he would become everything. No, this was not sufficient.\nIn a fit of restrained rage, he grabbed his fists and pumelled the beasts, slaying several smaller ones and making sure that each of them was dead. If he could grab them all and make them his thralls, he would, and he would need to savor their defeat and their enslavement if it meant that others would be safe. He would allow himself to crave ambition, power, arrogance, and psychopathy in order to embody love, because the only thing that mattered was the results. If psychopathy saved lives best, he would love it. Ha, if he couldn’t save anyone, in the end, what was he? A mere putrid mockery of the hope that brought him here.\nHe grabbed a dead beast and used it as a harbinger of himself toward the beasts. They would know his love and pain, because he would show them.\nHe kicked them, their face flying off toward the horizon.\nHe kicked them again. Again, again, again, again, again.\n“No more!” he screamed, as he saw the laborers getting ganged on by beasts.\nHe flinched when the beasts made a loud sound with their calls at each other and at the laborers, but he restrained his fear as well, chanelling it toward his fists as he grabbed several smaller beasts and massacred them endlessly until their bodies lay still. “No more!”\nBut the greater beasts were looming, surrounding him, and taking their place like kings.\nHe would not be able to live through this if he stayed. He had to abandon his rage and channel it forward toward retreat. This would be his tactical facet operating, because running it down would be much, much worse. He knew he should be satisfied with his current rewards and focus on returning to base, particularly the place where he could send an alert for reinforcements. He couldn’t lose his tempo.\nHowever, once the laborers failed to retreat and instead ran in directions away from safety and toward the beasts in a fit of confusion, they would die. He had to bite the bullet and choose the tactical ending instead of staying to communicate with them, because any more tempo wasted was likely to kill more laborers. He had to choose the choice with the likelier chance of success and trust the laborers to make the right choices and escape.\nChapter 2 - The Death of a Human Being linkAt the moment, outside the context of the reality of the past, next to Sprutnoa, Notch stood while view was askew, as his head felt dizzy due in part to the loud sounds and the wind blowing against his face. This wind came from the beast moving around, and he realized that he was this close to the beast: not just an enemy. It was his life moments away from death.\nRegarding the new forefront of the fight with the greater beasts, the task master’s kick did nothing. So he ran for his life, cradling the arm that he used to slash earlier.\nOne of the beasts stared down at a laborer, slashing her on the neck before she fell, her voice like a soft blanket in the warm sun. Her life’s worth was plunged away.\nThe task master gazed back, gnashing his teeth.\nSimultaneously, another beast grabbed a laborer and bit him, leaving his body partially eaten. His life’s worth was given a beating.\nThe task master shook his head with grief, tears dripping down his face, as he hoped to find help from his fellow task masters who had more lethal resources at their disposal.\nMoving on to Notch’s viewpoint, he was beginning to fade away, moving backward. Furthermore, his heart began to sense the matter-of-fact nature of death.\nOn a different note, the rest of the laborers were scattering beyond the beast’s immediate pouncing rage, while Notch still had a large amount of steps before he could join them. In the meantime, the task master was the farthest from the beasts, since his legs were well-conditioned for ganging up on victim-minded scum.\nReturning to Notch, he watched the laborers, running in another direction to avoid having the beasts converge on the highest amount of laborers in a single place. In the meantime, the beasts were right behind him, gaining a juggernaut-like momentum.\nMoreover, the task master was beginning to feel weak in his throat, as anxiety for the laborers made him shake as he ran.\nIndividually, Notch and Sprutnoa, the task master, shared a similar notion. If they stopped now, they wondered if they would live.\nAs soon as they thought that, they sunk an appreciable portion of energy into a burst of speed, flying forward.\nWhile Notch bursted, he deftly avoided the trees and barely held onto a smooth run, almost smacking his face against the wood. Feeling the weight of the beasts’ shadows on him, their sharp tips just above his back, if he stopped now, he would lose the hide of his back and beyond.\nSo he ran, his throat dry, his lungs sinking in agony, his legs about to buckle from the cringe of pain.\nIn the end, his breathing was frantic. Second, he made a few turns. Three, he sunk more appreciable energy into smoothing out his momentum across various different parts of his forest choice of path.\nWith the relief that came with fight-or-flight, he found himself outpaced at a place further than he could ever be before everything turned to dust. In other words, he was faster than his past self.\nBeside Notch, a laborer felt the tips of the beasts sink into his skin, past his muscles, and into his organs. In a moment, his scream fell short with a zip.\nCoincidentally, the task master couldn’t hear his pain, but he was already grieving for him.\nAnyway, Notch absentmindedly escaped because of the laborer, darting according to the plan that Maverick chalked up.\nAfter what felt like a long silence through the woods like that of a bunch of unsupervised kids playing in a wild dance, it was “Arghh!” that Notch screamed for the first time, a flurry of energy zipping into his veins. He would not be stopped.\nAs soon as he saw the two boys, they were hiding in a bush, their eyes like a bunch of tangerines in a vendor stall.\nIn the two boys’ eyes, a predatory urge showed its presence. When Notch recognized this, his face crumpled.\nEven after all the death, they thought about throwing Notch away if the beasts were on his tail. In the end, he couldn’t dare stay outside, so he threw himself like a barbarian into the bush.\nAs a result of his mad entry, the boys were too close to Notch to want to kill him now. Importantly, they were merely teenage peers in a desperate situation.\nWhen the beasts took form in the light, they arrived with red teeth wet with the blood of the fallen laborers’ heads.\nIn the silence of a great death, the boys had their heads moving on their own, and around, they went with elements of hurt, fear, and doom.\nThroughout the event of the massacre, the task master had already escaped, but Maverick was approaching, as 20 minutes had passed. From his perspective, he was about to swap with the boys, ignorant of the attack and the beasts’ presence. In his mind, he believed that the laborers were likely fighting the task masters, but he was ignorant regarding the beasts’ invasion into the laborers’ paths.\nBefore Notch came out of the vegetation, the boys next to him stopped him from alerting Maverick, as the beasts were already sneaking behind the confident Maverick, the arrogant Maverick.\nHe only wanted to know how the boys were doing, but it was not like he cared about them in particular. He just wanted to ensure that the mission of swapping between deputies went smoothyl. However, even if the beasts called, he still was not aware of what they meant. It was not like he didn’t hear them every time. It was just that the calls of today carried a different context. It was now horrific.\nShaking like people seeing themselves die, the boys tussled with each other amid Maverick’s confrontation with death right behind his back. They were trying to enact their will upon each other—either Notch would leave or he couldn’t. But he wanted to call Maverick.\n“Maverick!”\nIt was too late.\nNotch shouted with the sky backing his voice, turning his soul into a fiery pheonix and shining past the leaves and the hay that protected houses from rain. In this aura, Maverick was within his grasp. He bolted, his arms stretching out.\nYet, before Maverick screamed, the beasts already got him, glancing immediately at Notch who had hidden himself already before they were able to register his presence.\nThen and there in the bushes, Maverick fell to the ground, his body thudding against the forest floor like a wet pile of clothes.\nNotch gasped, as if he was the one who lost his soul.\nThe way he fell was emphatic like he was marching into the king’s court about to make the biggest dick joke. It invited hilarity in a way that seemed obtuse and ignorant of the true circumstances. No, it was laughable knowing the truth. The way he died resembled the start of the joke, and the end of it.\nDespite the troublesome way he died, his choice of clothes were beautiful. Besides, it was like seeing a bunch of ants growing in a hill, working together and learning how to navigate over their complex environment similar to the roots of trees. Apart from this, his eyes were colorful, as nature, light, and various shades and tints of the mixtures of the environment reflected in an askew manner in them. To end, his posture was like a marble statue, its body extending and curling with sense of finesse, each bend a unique complicated structure full of expressionist equity.\nNotch saw all the beauty, because he couldn’t accept the idea of death, even if he saw and heard it. In his heart, he never knew death, because death was just a word and something people said as part of expressions and speeches. Here, death was real like a friend one tussled with about which weapon was the best. Here, it was like talking to a friend at a dinner and hearing about how his father left. Here, it was like seeing Maverick get clawed by beasts, because it was.\nIt was reality.\nIn response to Maverick’s death, the boys turned their shock, terror, and grief into physicality, slamming their fists, arms, and legs against the ground and each other, continually pressing on against each other in a violent embrace. With a quiet muffled wretched expression, they stuck to the darkness and kept their voices hidden. But it was like holding in the pressure of the earth. Here, the mountains and earthquakes magnified their struggle. From dust to dust, from life to life, from heart to heart, they were like ancient celestial beings full of light in their grief: since their grief was rare and fresh, it was priceless. With their struggling, twisting, and beating, they became the epitome of their selves, beating one step closer out of their boxes, out of their rooms, and into the divine light—power, agency, control, rage, freedom, and standing up instead of staring and standing still away from helplessness, humiliation, and unpredictability. In the long term, like tossing ships, they trudged, castrating themselves until they rendered this earth to their domain.\nIn the meantime, the task master pointed and returned alongside several other stronger task masters who stunned the beasts with magic from magic wands.\nIn the end, the beasts ran into flight, tredding like rabbits looking to cut time short, which left behind the loss of the laborers: a very disappointing result for the task masters, especially Sprutnoa, who stood in a lonely, forlorn manner in the distance.\nOn a more calculated note, Notch and the boys wanted to hide, since Maverick, their patron, was already dead. His memories turned to swine guts, and time was still ticking for the swap to happen. In their mind, they were already swapping with each other. They had imprinted this visualization in their mind that it still rung true now. They didn’t know what to do, as the screams from the attack mingled with these images like a soggy shoed foot stamping a brisky pond.\nShifting to what the boys had to say about this, one of the boys, Billy, had this to say: “How are we going to get this done? We need to just move on somehow. And it really doesn’t make sense. I don’t even understand what I’m supposed to be doing here. Ah, I see. This entire thing, this entire operation was a frickin’ joke. We’ve been bamboozled. I think we’re fricked over. This is it, I think. I cannot believe I spent all this time just to lose everything. I cannot believe I even tried, no joke. I feel like I’ve completely lost the sense of every single piecily little bitty nitty pork beef thing. I don’t know! I am absolutely stuck. I am rolling in, in, in the mud. I am falling, falling, like an unable-to-be-perfect person. Nah, not a… Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. I… Ah, what the f— I’m done. I am absolutely done, man. This is a big joke. Okay? Hahahaha. It’s let’s go! Yoohoo! Yahoo! Alright. I am done. I am, I am done.” He began to chuckle and laugh.\n“In the end, I am an absolute gobsmack.”\nTransitioning to the rational side of this event, the plan that involved a complex swapping in order for Maverick to avoid working too hard became useless. They could only rely on themselves now to navigate this complex situation and return to their normal lives. So, they stood up and walked away, since the task masters were clearly ignorant of their existence in this rare, unfortunate incident.\nIn terms of aesthestic, the sound of fresh rain filled the air, as the task masters drank from their pouches. Moreover, the morning shed light on the beasts that merely wanted a meal. Finally, the freshness of sunlight and rain accompanied the sense that it was the the heavens that dripped large buckets of water into the clouds.\nReturning to the boys, they arrived at the city, their home, before anything else traumatic happened to them—their figures dissipating into the great city.\nIn conclusion to their first day, they learned about the dangers of accepting favors from even the most confident strangers, as Maverick looked very suave to them when he approached. Indeed, it was like meeting a prince from a faraway land. As mentioned earlier, they would castrate themselves until they rendered the earth to their domain, whether philosophical, literal, or both. As for the problem of this statement, they would change and grow overtime alongside their ambition, meaning that they would be forced to be still due to how big they were getting, which just wasn’t possible. In the end, they were not going to keep a mask or veneer on or pretend and lie to themselves forever. Sooner or later, they would move forward, taking the buildings with them. If murder, then murder. If love, then love. If sky, then sky.\nHe would become everything.\nEarlier, Notch stared at the grass next to Sprutnoa, revealing himself as a deputy for Maverick.\nSprutnoa looked at him. “Why are you here?” His voice was small, light, and all the beautiful things. But it was faint, carrying a burden anyone could carry, but no could admit. He was a masculine person.\nNotch smiled faintly before he said, “I want to ask you what it feels like?” He was referring to something distinct only to him; in the end, it was something only he could answer.\nInevitably, Sprutnoa shook his head as if dismissing something he was about to say before he frowned with grief. “I… tried.” He sounded high-pitched there for a moment, reflecting his sense of futility. “I did. I really did. It’s funny.” He laughed as he spoke. What he meant by “funny” was that it was almost so depressing that it almost felt like a big joke that he tried in the first place. “Because it’s everything that I am not. I am not everything that I want to be. For now, I am utterly normal. That’s the point. I want to remind you this is all a part of the game. This is all a part of life, and if you think it’s hard, it is. It’s just that nothing’s going to make sense. You have to keep going, and I know that it’s difficult. Maverick. I don’t know if he’s close to you. I’m not going to… pretend. I just have to tell you right now that you deserve someone. You deserve friends. Tell me how great they are because I remember so many things about people. I remember when Maverick hit me with a magical artifact, and it was an accident. And of course, it was… well… it was broken. But I didn’t care about it. I was just having fun because we were just doing our best. He was a good worker. Or laborer. And I can’t say anything else to do because he didn’t say anything else but that. You know, the working thing. It’s everything that I know about him. I wonder though because I have a big life. Did he… with everything that happened… Did he do anything that he liked?” After seeing the confusion in Notch’s face, he continued: “Did he… What did he feel?”\nHe continued as if he was responding to himself: “I don’t know. I don’t know.\n“I will never know.” In the past, he would often hide his feelings and mince his words, he had lived too long in a relatively short amount of time, making him self-fulfilled at a younger age than most, giving him lots of time to explore his newfound self-fulfillment, skill, and confidence.\nNotch merely listened, but he learned a lot. Moreover, with Sprutnoa’s help, he helped his two new friends tentatively and preliminarily move on from the event.\nThe reason he met Sprutnoa was because he stayed there in the vicinity of Maverick and the task masters for a while alongside the other two boys with him, inspired by the way the task masters dealt with the beasts and shocked at Maverick and the other laborers’ deaths. After the task masters allowed them to leave, that was when they all went home… What was it again?\nChapter 3 - The Marchacha Goblin Assault linkIn the end, on day two, the morning arose, and Billy, who was one of the two boys with Notch, was shaking like an abandoned forest, too terrified even to go outside. But his father forced him, making him get jobs in the street.\nToday, Notch, Billy, and the other boy, Shadrach, were together fortunately, as the job they got needed four. As for the fourth one with them, she was a taller, armored woman with a bamboo hat inlaid with metal. This woman looked like one of those knights from stories, but she looked too bitter for that. Her face was like a cacophony of dogs tearing out flesh from a variety of discarded receptacles on the ground.\nIn this world, they were heading to the cave to which Maverick would carry bags, but even if Billy was scared, the woman’s presence was like a guiding light. She would have been attractive too, if it was not for her terrifying resting face.\nIn short, Notch, Billy, and Shadrach, three comrades, joined the armored woman.\nWhen they arrived at the cave, the glasses-wearing, frizzled-hair, plump, suit-wearing man who hired all four of them began to speak with a stutter at first: “You guys… I wanted to motivate you guys by telling you about the history of this place, but you guys seem motivated enough. So I’ll summarize the plan quickly.”\nIn brief, Notch, Billy, Shadrach, and the armored woman joined the man who hired them.\nThe man continued: “Now, when it comes to preventing goblins from digging up holes as the miners mine, you’re going to have to use these potions.\n“Now, they’re not dangerous on their own. But too much outside air, and they explode.\n“Don’t worry, it’s not too big, but the point is they’re good for scaring away goblins.\n“I don’t know exactly why, but I know they have a history…”\nHe saw what he thought were bored expressions from the four. “Nevermind, okay, go on ahead now. I’ll lead the way.”\nHe walked and gestured to several differect sections, showing the complex system that they had created over the course of two years. It required intensive care and maintenance to prevent cave collapse.\nAs for the workers, he usually just remarked that they should buy healing potions from the market. He was practically ignorant about the rapidly changing prices due to how unpredictable adventurers tended to be, as they were a predominant demographic when it came to potion stock.\nBut his business worked well with his approach, so he often showed a “don’t break it if it ain’t broken” attitude when questioned.\nNow that the four knew what to do, they ignored the departure of the man who hired them and headed toward searching for sudden changes of color in the wall, as the goblins tended to use magical tools that made the walls greenish in order to make pores.\nThe sound of mining in the background soothed them, even though they were loud. Billy, Notch, and Shadrach enjoyed the noise, because the city was often much louder, making this mining noise like a calming whisper to them.\n“Just like that, okay?” said Billy, catching the attention of the two other morning-fatigued boys. “We’ve finally completed the job. Just need to completely obliterate everything.” He was being metaphorical. “I am genuinely going to complete like a frickin’ quest. This is actual adventurer activity, no joke. Rambling on, taking on, fighting on like a soldier or something. That crazy kind. Everybody knows that that’s the best world… in the world. It’s like wonderful, joyous, amazing… Yeah!”\nNotch laughed, saying: “Are you serious? Just follow Shadrach’s lead. We can finish this in a short time.”\nShadrach nodded and said: “Yeah, yeah, I can completely get this done. Just follow my lead, yeah. That’s great.” He hummed in thought. “We can talk to the goblins. That’s, that’s a good idea.” He said while laughing, “Let’s see what they have to say.\n“I don’t know if this is going to work out though. Very not perfection.”\nHe wondered if the miners had anything interesting to say, but he dismissed them as being too physically inclined, always thinking about the same repetitive routine like a bunch of robotic golems.\nThough, Billy challenged him on that and mentioned that miners often liked to work out, which was why they became miners to show their passion.\nNotch added context that the miners often forgot the working out and just became absent-minded for their job.\nTheir discussion involved not only the miners and the goblins but also how they were going to fare when the goblins did come.\nNow, at the moment, the goblins were behind the walls, but they were busy listening to what the boys had to say, as they often only heard the pickaxe of miners hitting the cave walls.\nIn essence, the goblins were in the same cave network barely out of sight.\nAnyway, any interesting development in the conversation of the boys gave them pause.\nIf they could find out how the humans were able to mine so well, they would be able to harness the means to destroying the mining operation once and for all, freeing themselves from what they saw as the tyranny of the human species.\nTheir great ideals contrasted the comfort in the voices of the boys and the woman, who were busy achieving some level of cooperation after the woman decided to greet them and ask how they day was.\nThe woman’s face mimicked two golden orbs flashing around in a circle with the way she relocated her head from spot to spot during her conversation with the boys like a dynamic blobfish—poofy, exquisitely majestic like an apple served with sauce, or fragrant so tangibly that it sought to devour the teeth and then be devoured in kind like a pop of spectacular niceties jumbled up into a beauty. Second, her voice was like morning dew, tender yet supple enough to cultivate the tastes, memorable and quintessential to the essence of a regular person. Three, the sounds of her throat danced to the tune of an empty stomach being breaded with rice. Four, her groans were calmly lit on rousing clouds, as she plowed around to prepare herself somehow, utilizing her mother’s technique of preparatory walking.\nMoving on to a more physically commanding note, more than walking, the technique intensified her whole body due to the way she squatted while walking or attempted postures that stimulated her flexibility and cadence in posture adjustment. As a second point, it was tentative, pushing through, swallowing the flow, and engaging the highlighted muscles, treading the path, sewing each muscle tight into that like a bundle. Lastly, her exercise was developmental and bridged her transition from the moments to the soaring in the combatant realm.\nIt was like shadows or ghosts moving, since her gestures were often marked with a sense of elegance; any of this sense looked like celestial clarity to the boys, considering the weight of a noble compared to a peasant.\nMeanwhile, movements in the goblins were that of recording the conversations like skilled laborers in a time of heated conflict between two companies. Second, their fine motor skills were eclectic, as they wielded several kinds of pens for several different fonts, typefaces, and sizes in contribution to the visual hierarchy wetting their documents. Third, they reimagined majestic magicians in the way they forged their notes of wisdom, like goddesses of light who brought clarity to the deathly throes, and like the gracious movements of soldiers in a bitter battle to the end.\nFollowing the initial, transient phase of their plan, they achieved a sense of enlightenment, because they were ready. With a delighted gurgle-like giggle, they injecting their weapons into the wall. In the silence that succeeded, the whirring of the machines emerged, which came before the cracking of the walls.\nAs the whirring began to sound across the wall, dropping a few drops of attention in the place where the boys, the woman, and the miners lounged and worked, they meditated in all its variety and nuances that had no fighting place in the intimate heat of the war.\nFor a few seconds, they were going to deny fear and the weaknesses of their past.\nBut now that they thought about it, it had all been leading here, out on the highway, Multa—born and raised, born and raised.\nImmediately, the wall collapsed, running from the structure of the cave, and accompanying it were the goblin figures.\nWith the agency of their hands, more holes opened, and spears flew out in snake-like forms.\nBefore the goblins could adjust to the light sources in the cave, the miners ran, while the boys tried to steadied themselves first before joining the miners in their flight to the exit.\nSubsequently, screams and cries were enough to signal to the goblins that they could begin the next phase of their plan.\nIn finality, they let them leave, as they were busy picking up the pickaxes and studying their material. With the high marksmanship of a sneeze, words fell upon notepads. Due to the swirl of the words, notepads piled up like just cooked red rice at a marketplace. Shifting to a tasty vein, they moved like flavors in a sauce in the tongue of the consumer, grace gracing the tip of their records.\nMeanwhile, the boys scattered, their arms shaking, the woman keeping them from leaving completely.\nA moment was required to complete their study of the mining operation before they fled backward, leaving holed walls in their wake.\nThe man who hired them was stomping toward the boys and the woman, moving closer and closer, furious.\nSince the goblins trespassed aggressively, several issues were flaring.\n“What happened?” the man who hired them said, his breath hot. “I don’t get it,” he said impatiently.\n“I’m sorry—” said the woman, who let go of the boys and stood straight ahead of them and in front of the man.\n“Come on, please… May I understand what the hell in the world is going on!” the man said politely but with a louder voice.\n“I saw the goblins, I, I, I… not just me but—”\n“The potions, the potions!”\n“Definitely—”\n“I gave you the potions, man!” The man raised his arm as if he was about to toss it to the ground when he recognized the holes. “These were the Marchacha goblins. Like seriously! Come on!”\nIn the meantime, a loud muffled boom in the distance from the direction of the holes bewildered them, making them cock their heads.\nAn air of frustration began to sweep over them, and they regained that spunk they lost from how masterful the Marchacha goblins operated.\nThe voices of the miners began to take prominence, a wind of fervor, a song of targeted glory.\n“What the hell!”\n“Yeah, what the hell is this!”\n“We can’t have this!”\n“Oh, no, we can’t!”\n“Take them down!”\n“This ain’t right!”\nFrom a emotional perspective, the miners were no longer going to sit still and watch. They were going to do something this time. They were not losers, lost causes, or too weak. They were everything that these goblins could not perceive. They were just getting ready to march.\nFrom a rational vantage point, they knew they felt humiliated, and they identified their desire to throw themselves at the goblins and see what ordinary hands could do to something fragile. But they were fathers, gentlemen, and country men, not brutal, self-sacrificing, benumbed militants in a war.\nIn the end, they stomped over the broken glass of the potions that fell to the ground during the goblins’ scare, signaling their desire to press forward in the world.\nOn the side, Billy, Notch, and Shadrach stared at the miners, while the armored woman with them followed their lead.\n“We badly need a plan…” said a voice. On top of this, it was more piercing than the other relevant voices in the joinery of miners.\nMoving on to the larger scale, the miners gathered together and formed a vulnerable circle.\nIn the circle, the leader of their mining operation, the man who hired the boys and the woman, Leroy, tied their perceptions together.\n“Okay, seriously guys,” Leroy said, “with everything that’s going on. Like, you two, three. I know you guys are awesome, and I really think you guys matter. And yeah, but…\n“Whatever. I hired you guys for a ‘simple’ job, but today, the Marchacha goblins have struck outside of our expectations.”\n“I hope… I really do hope we can continue to get this done—everything,” he continued with his teeth closed, making a firm, strict tone, “considering that my job involves managing overall operations.”\nHe raised his purple necklace politely to show his wealth matter-of-factly to emphasize his point, snickering politely.\n“According to what you guys saw earlier, do you think it’s possible that this entire operation is possible for the people in front of me right now.”\nHe chuckled playfully as he spoke, “What I’m trying to say is that can you take it?”\n“Okay, we can try that,” the woman interjected, glancing at the boys expectantly. “That’s a yes.”\nNext to the woman, the boys looked at each other, only thinking that this situation could only get worse. With their thoughts in a good place, they decided that being together was better. Furthermore, after their fiasco with Maverick’s job, working together was the reason they gave to themslves and each other for still being alive.\nWith a clap, they agreed to the plan.\nNow that the arrangements felt natural to everyone, they all moved to their places and begun to engage in productive ways of dealing with the attack. One, they fixed and filled holes. Two, they collected and piled up the pickaxes in case of a sudden attack during their little fix-up. Three, they moved several fortifications toward areas where the goblins were expected to attack. To conclude, it was a very short but intense introductory period of their journey.\nWith a huff, they exclaimed that it was very easy when they were done.\nIn the background, several event organization coordinators from various districts were concerned regarding the arrival of the Marchacha goblins, so they contacted the most relevant victim of the event, Leroy.\nNonetheless, news travelled quickly, and soon, everyone in the city knew about the attack of the goblins.\nDelving into the historical aspects, firstly, the district where the attack occurred was situated on a large mountain where a flourishing forest crawled down the hill from the montane woodlands to the rich volcanic soil of the valleys. Secondly, the valleys were under the control of the city, but the district held highest control. Thirdly, since these valleys were precious relative to the rest of the city region, the district was also a highly regarded one. As for why these reasons mattered, the idea of interlopers disrupting the supply chain on the aforementioned regional geopolitics by introducing guerilla forces in various isolated areas was concerning to the various entities within the city and its vastness.\nMoreover, the relevance of the issue compelled adventurers to run on foot and horseback to get to the district first because much of the predicted activity of concern was now central there.\nIn response to the attack, people of all age groups were astounded.\nOne, kids saw texts that referenced goblins. Moreover, they were listening to stories of goblins all over again, as the stories of goblins faded recently before the attack. In conclusion, kids were being educated in the principles of goblin strategy, as they were expected to replace the civilians of tomorrow.\nTwo, teenagers were associating goblins with thoughts of their place in the world. Additionally, they were already on their way to enlist in jobs near the site of concern because of how lucrative they expected it to get. Thirdly, this was mostly the opportunists who were doing it. Ultimately, more than half of the teenagers were content to sit back and wait until a second attack before stepping out of their comfort zone.\nFinally, the clammoring at various social spots and discussions the implications of such an event by adults of various ages from those in their twenties to those in their eighties came through various modes of communication and its subsets, styles.\nShifting to the perpetrators in the attack, they were busy in their thoughts. As goblins, they minded the other species in the region, who each managed an unspoken portion in the region. If they dared intrude without asking for permission first, they would get colluded against. In the end, they were meager attackers who only relied on the division between miners and adventurers through their shared dislike of each other in order to explore the means of the humans more.\nMoving on to the everyday, Billy couldn’t help but ask the human woman if she was a goblin because of the way her face looked.\nWith a squint, the woman reprimanded him, but she chose courteous words, picking out formal options to refrain from harming the poor kid’s already faltering confidence: “Such as it that asking me that question might impinge upon my ability to act effectively. That you said that was an offense that I am unwilling to take as agreeable. Rather, it is crucial to delight in much more indirect means of alerting me regarding my appearance. That is all.”\nIn simple terms, she said that he should do two things: avoid asking that question since it was offensive and be more indirect when it comes to alerting her about her looks.\nSince Billy was too confused, he forwent answering her. Subsequently, he slipped into the conversation between Notch and Shadrach: “Right? It was this way after all!”\nTo avoid humiliation, the woman introduced herself, “I am Millie like the hands of the a mill.” On a more common note, this was a typical gesture, a sprinkle of everyday humor.\nIn the meantime, proceeding in the mines, the miners began to slow down, while time ticked into nighttime. Here, the torches showed their greatest strength: preventing the night from swallowing mankind.\nIn a more frantic vein, a scream, a wail, and a moment’s embrace was all enough to explain the horrors of the night.\nFrom the depths of the dark lucidity of the forest, monsters took their forms and snatched them into their bodies, making moves.\nBefore they fell away into their darkest darkness, they seized definition and climbed up the ranks to existence, marking their throng gathering. In this throng, shadows wielded axes of death, swords of heavenly abandon—the kinds that murdered for justice that had little basis—and the whitest eyes.\nAcross the gap between light and darkness, several adventurers stood. In a state of meditation, they faced the depth of the forest on a headland, the middle of their swords reflecting the light of the sun.\nTransitioning to the memory of friendship, these adventurers stood at the horizon where the earth below symbolized the past.\nIn reality, they began the fight between them and monsters that occurred in seconds.\nOn the first second, they moved swiftly, making an arc with the tip of their blades, like a dragon knight craving justice. A burst of color flew from a zombie, as hundreds of skeletons directed their aim.\nBeauty was painful.\nOn the second second, a volley of arrows flew, as tens of magic shields appeared, swallowing the adventurers whole and embracing them, preventing them from death.\nBeauty turned someone into a desperate frustrated struggle to appreciate it.\nOne rock from a sling, a highly challenging ranged weapon, crushed a zombie in one hit.\nOn the third second, timely explosion in the zombies due to accidental contact between an explosive skeleton and a fiery zombie was enough for the adventurers to put down their shields and fight.\nBeauty made someone enraged at the thought of someone not feeling the same feeling and living in a world without it.\nDuring the next minute, a war raged, as hundreds of adventurers charged in unison. Tens of them flew forward with temporary flight, as swords flew with their owners riding them. It was a journey of everlasting grace, and when it ended, the zombies met fire, water, ice, and all sorts of magic. The blades, first and foremost, cast blood straight from the confines of their skin, providing them passages whence red rushed like screaming onions.\nIncidentally, a man wearing a mask stood at the horizon making a portal in the middle of the battle and teleporting away, reaching out and taking the souls of the adventurers who died.\nIn his head, he wanted to ensure that he collected enough souls to fill up a completion gauge that indicated the progress toward a certain spell of his. Ultimately, he was a very complex person with a very complicated set of skills and influence.\nReturning to reality and the battlefield, for several seconds, a magical blade of glory arrived amidst the sea of adventurers, marking itself as a glowing object. It shone, and the sea of lights all looked dim in its presence. It belonged to a strong marcher, slashing and tossing aside a coalescing of mobs.\nIn a moment, several mobs grabbed several adventurers.\nBefore a break could intervene, bursts of cries sang.\nIn the distance, in a flank, an adventurer fell to the ground and hit his head badly.\nFrom the main grouping, several adventurers magically swiftly removed themselves from a wall of defence to save this adventurer.\nMeanwhile, the line of defence was cracking, as adventurers were getting pushed back.\nIn another flank, several adventurers fell to the ground, as they were pulled away by trolls, whose arms weighed more than enough to crush a steadfast wagon.\nIn several seconds, the trolls smashed them and focused on satisfying their hunger, crunching men like steak.\nAbruptly, these men had only a few seconds where they could remember their lives, unfortunately forgetting their favorite things since their childhood. Before they could remember, they laughed at how ridiculous their situation was, notably considering that, rather than crying, it was better to go out laughing. It was cold, they was tired, and it was raining. They had hardly spoken to my family and wondered how things were at home. Their cool gear suddenly felt like a costume, and they despised the idea of war more than ever; the false bravado presented itself all around them. Yet, they still knew somebody had to stand up and do the job because humanity was deeply flawed. They would always fight. With a final crunch, they exploded under the weight of raw power.\nWith their feet following a serpentine pattern, the trolls fled victoriously, while the adventurers scrambled for footing in the fight, exasperated.\nThe joining of the trolls with the encompassing shadow of the forest signified their exit.\nFrustrated, the adventurers groaned and devotedly healed themselves, as potions fell.\nMeanwhile, the ‘brrrrt’ sound of magic inspired them, returning a significant portion of their energy through: a morale boost and a lifesaver.\nWith that said, monsters flew backward or to the ground on impact with long-ranged magic, while magic shields and physical shields took the brunt of the monsters’ ranged attacks.\nBringing up to an elevated level, the moonlight, coupled with the clouds, sectioned through the mobs, as adventurers and monsters embraced each other in a slaughter.\nMoving back to the ground, the monsters were falling bit by bit.\n“No, no, no!” went the monsters with the blades.\n“Argh! Argh Argh!” The monsters could only hold so long.\n“Shee! Shee! Shee!” Even the ghostly figures turned to something distant like smog.\nTransitioning to the overall level, the monsters and the adventurers were in a constant war, but rather than a full-fledged war, it was like hide and seek in an abstract expressionist art of terrain.\nIn conclusion, the goblin attack was more than just an isolated incident, and the most relevant people—Notch, Shadrach, Millie, Billy, Leroy, and his miners—were a part of it. This would all come together, including monsters, adventurers, and everyday people of all age groups.\nChapter 4 - The Adventurers’ Incursion: Chaos Unleashed linkOn the other side of the coin, the next morning greeted Notch, Shadrach, Millie, and Billy with a soft whisper: “Wake up!”\nIt was day 3, which was 72 hours, 4,320 minutes, or 259,200 seconds.\nThe “Wake up!” voice belonged to the mining operation leader, Leroy. His smile was almost blinding: he knew that he finally found his most loyal members.\nHe was sure that anyone he could feed his delicious food and accomodate in terms of housing had the potential to become loyal trustees of a wide range of tasks, roles, and situations.\nLying and embracing each other on the futon-like bed on the floor, the brothers were surprised to see the woman lying with her head directly on the floor with zero bedding.\nAfter a short discussion about bedding and comfort, everyone returned to the mining operation site.\nEven though Leroy looked tired, he was poised to address issues where applicable, serving like a task master toward his miners without the detention and whipping. To address safety concerns, he regularly hired guards for himself. Though, he would rather rely on his instincts whether to hire or not. So, he sometimes forwent having guards. When he did have guards, he made sure they were hiding somewhere nearby. This made it so that anyone who dared approached him approached him with the risk of having their life cut short. This risk was why the woman was particular about physically stepping carefully and being generally ladylike toward her co-workers, peers, and bosses, especially the aged businessman in a cautiously isolated field of work. In other words, Leroy was likely seasoned in dealing with matters related to self-defence, confrontation, and rebellion.\nHis expression, despite calm and almost like a man with a wife and six kids, made the aforementioned woman stop walking when he glanced at her wrinkles in a curious but overall courteous manner.\nFrom Leroy’s perspective, ten hundred steps was enough for him to engage his leg muscles, as he was constantly in need of exercise due to his age. If he wanted to become stronger, he would have to work more times as hard compared to someone as young as Millie who was still in her twenties. In the end, he could only walk so far before he started using an adjutant to handle orders and information. He already knew how crucial it was to handle things far away from the site, so he returned home and relied on just his words and his trust in his reliable adjutants to communicate information effectively.\nNow that Leroy was absent, Millie relaxed, concentrating on the boys again, who were offering suggestions for their appearances. The boys were wondering whether a red tunic of the task master they saw yesterday was an excellent choice for looking cool. After all, they were still boys aged 13, 14, and 18. Billy was the one aged 18 ironically.\nBy the time they finished their discussion, the miners took a break, sitting weirdly with their feet on their seats, massaging between their toes like a bunch of hobos. They almost looked like kings in their personal homes, which made Shadrach approach and interface them, with the other two boys and Millie sauntering closely behind.\nWhile Shadrach did his new thing, Leroy was busy lounging in his small but serviceable home, taking a deep breath. Meanwhile, he was adjacent to his wife, who was busy sitting down on a chair and sleeping.\nSpeaking of their relationship, they were very intimate with each other in an almost inextricable way, as in intimate even without constant romantic expressions.\nMeanwhile, Leroy was also very attentive to the bell noise hanging outside his window because that was the signal that his messengers used.\nWhen the bell rung, a message line ran all the way through the city, into the wilderness, and to the mining operation site. There, the message, like an explosion, rippled across the miners, as they gathered in various spots and targeted certain spots for maximum efficacy. As for why changing spots was even necessary, the cave was confusing, similar to a beast that kept moving around because it was full of unknowns. Anytime it seemed that a certain part of it was defenceless, effort was spent into ensuring that that this part was assaulted. However, the beast constantly changed and moved, and all its unknowns seemed to lie as well, making up falsehoods to the frustration of miners. This was why it was essential that the miners were flexible in their focus.\nThis was why it was crucial for direction, and Leroy was the man for the job.\nThe job felt a sense of fulfillment at the end of morning and the start of the afternoon.\nThe smell of tropical heat flew like colorful flowers in the wind or like a spring that chokes out the negative energies of a person. So the miners moved outside to get some shade and air, as their throats were already itching at their limits.\nA cacophony of coughs marked the start of their break, as they could finally express in some way their struggle and effort.\nShadrach was most elucidated by this complexity, as he was most concentrated. But the heat said enough to declare to the other two boys and Millie that this was painstaking. With enough cloth to wrap and cover their heads, the miners easily inspired the boys to do the same, sharing a moment of cultural connection.\nBecause of the weight of this complexity and the heat, Shadrach felt that he was disappearing and re-assembling himself constantly.\nBecause it was a struggle, he was failing to re-assemble himself, often repeating the whole process.\nAfter what felt like an hour, he woke up and found himself alone in the middle of the forest in front of the entrance to the mining operation site.\nHe bolted inside, noticing Millie strutting behind him in the distance outside.\nBehind her, an army of adventurers were clammoring, raising their voices.\n“We did it!”\n“Let’s go!”\n“Alright!”\nWith the way they jumped around, walked, and raised their voices, they were like wasps misidentifying the unique patterns on the faces of fellow colony members and preparing to charge them.\nIt was a gathering of various adventurer parties, but the problem was that they were planning to enter the caves and locate the goblins there. This was very risky, but the adventurers knew that the goblins were “nasty raiders,” or so the officials said.\nThe hype that the goblin attack garnered looked excessive, only serving to waste the money of the contractors of the adventurers. Yet, the contractors were sure that this was a good opportunity to strike.\nSo the adventurers forced their way into the mining operation site to find the goblins through the holes they made. The problem was that the holes were already filled up, so the adventurers decided to move away fortifications. If they were too stuck, they broke them apart. They were going to create holes just to find the goblins. This was like soldiers occupying houses during an enemy siege.\nThe adventurers truly loved the chaos they brought, even smirking and swaggering in the faces of the miners. Most of them were adults, yet they acted like reckless teenagers with lots of money to waste.\nWhen one of the miners advanced to speak up, they fortunately only blocked him. It could have evolved into that of the outspoken laborer during Maverick’s plan with the boys.\nShifting to the political and social realm, many loudmouth adventurers regarded laborers like villager miners, traders, and farmers as zombies who waste their time working menial jobs because they’re too afraid to take risks and succeed, seeing them as ambitionless losers.\nPivoting to a more complex level, a fantastical magical society put magic and magic-related resources such as potions, skills, tamed monsters, and enchanted equipment into the hands of users without specialized magic or even technical knowledge, thereby empowering these individuals with the benefits and opportunities of the technology. This resulted in brazenness and the ability to act violently on impulses, both of which would be otherwise absent.\nBringing it down to a miner detachment’s perspective, they offered to guide the adventurers for a price, and many adventurers accepted. But these adventurers paid multiple times over instead of choosing to haggle for a lower price. They cared too much about appearances to benefit without paying, so they secretly arranged for other adventurers to benefit while forgoing payment by just telling them to follow those who did pay. This was contradictory behavior in the eyes of the miners, who already expected the adventurers to do the secret arrangement. This was a sign of the complex ways people interact and cause misunderstandings due to ignorance, being impromptu, apathy, callousness, and maintaining a certain image, among others.\nHowever, the miners had little confidence in exploring the caves themselves, so the adventurers served as a more ignorant comparison that distracted from the miners’ infinitesimal analytical knowledge of the caves. So this was a lucrative deal for the miners built on convincing presentation.\nFinally, the miners put little effort and already managed to uphold the confirmation to their boss that they were valuable members.\nWhile they traversed the cave, Billy, Shadrach, Millie, and Notch watched the miners who remained fix the fortifications that the adventurers broke.\nMeanwhile, the loose army of adventurers quadrisected themselves. Afterwards, they trisected themselves and bisected recusively until their smallest units consisted of two individuals at least.\nInvestigating their skill set, they unleashed themselves in an structured and organized matter. One division consisted of powerful artillery units who utilized specialized intensive magic that relied on gathered intelligence in order to hit targets. Namely, these included magic like [Choke], which relied on aligning very loose and hard-to-control particles. This makes it a specialty of users who have devoted years of effort into learning how to control these particles to form in a way that allows for [Choke] to occur. So often times, the users of this magic stay far away and rely on information to launch precise attacks, since they had to release control of their bodies to concentrate on their magic. In conclusion, they cradled precision and control as hard as they could.\nTurning to something grim, the monsters imagined themselves as children frolicking in the sunset, their hideous expressions replacing that of children. They wanted to be free, but what was known to be great and happy was not something that their faces and body could ever adorn. They were stuck in a shield of soon-to-be-bodies.\nWhat felt like hundreds of pain and suffering became turned to dust, the meaning of their lives soiled like wet rags in a desert mound. “Too late,” said a cracking voice in it. If rage could speak, it would embrace them.\nOnce the cave turned into hellfire, the monsters were thrown to one corner, their eyes and faces full of fear, trembling with their hands on their knees and their arms adjacent to their bodies. Lying next to a body, one of them imagined a bird flowing through the air and waving the tip of its wings with a fresh smell of cinammon and spices before he, too, passed from the river of life.\n“It’s only natural,” said monster scouts hiding in a cavity in the cave, the owners of these smiles, in a sarcastic tone. “This is what you deserve.” Instead of standing up for their monster brothers and sisters, they beat their self-respect to a pulp, threw chairs at it, bit it apart limb by limb, flooded it with their tears, and screamed at it in confusion before they escaped, letting the adventurers keep getting away with it. Maybe, they also felt that they, as monsters, did deserve to die because they were too weak to stand up for themselves and do something instead of watching their siblings suffer helplessly and cry and beg under the oppression of those hypocrites who preached goodness and moral maturity. Indeed, there was no way that monsters deserved to die. Ultimately, they would prepare to enlighten the humans to overthrow the adventurers.\nScrutinizing the social divide between monsters, the affluent monsters dared oppress and mock the poor, washing their hands with their the liquid they use to wash their bright faces of purity, incessantly complaining about whether the path where tens of thousands travelled and where they arbitrarily walked was perfectly even and tailored to their individual wants. Even so, they dared behave like lapdogs toward the humans who treated them as inferiors. They hated their own people. How dare they? The worst part about them was how out of touch they were with what was normal.\nAs a final consideration, the monsters would represent an all-consuming fire. Then, they would be condemned by people who spent an everyday laborer’s year’s wages on toys.\nFrom the perspective of the adventurers, these monsters included fresh “batbogs”, delicious “danderlions”, and delicate “eye-singers”. But the Marchacha goblins were absent from what these adventurers could see.\nAs a counterpoint to the monster scouts’ social commentary, the adventurers had to protect humans, even with all the issues. It was either the monsters or the humans. Sure, humans could be evil, but that didn’t make monsters innocent. If the monsters were the one on top, they would be doing the same if not worse. A compromise between monsters and humans would only be possible if monsters could centralize and stop each other from killing humans. Humans were doing everything they could to safeguard the safety, which often was the status quo, losing many honorable adventurers in the process. It was up to very awesome people to advance the human race beyond the status quo. In sum, the adventurers’ job was maintaining stability and, by extension, the safety of people living slow, comfortable lives rather than disjointed, erratic ones.\nAll in good fun, whether for trolls or adventurers, the exertion of power was just that simple.\nChapter 5 - Echoes of Formative Days: A Prelude to Labor and Leadership linkViewed through a poetic lens, the eye-singers flew like angels in the sky, pulling apart and down golden strings of heavenly honor floating in zero gravity. They were like singers at a choir, wafting humanizing elements into the hearts of tied, stuck gray figures symbolizing humankind.\nMoving on to the monsters’ physical elements, the eye-singers were birds whose chirps made eyes burn.\nTwo, the danderlions were tall bipedal beasts like trolls but with flowers and grass growing all over them at fast rates to the point that they often woke up in a great pile of vegetation if other animals didn’t clean the vegetation off them.\nThree, the batbogs were toed bats with wings that they used as extra prehensile appendages.\nFinally, the dynamic between these monsters was that of a reliance on the magical qualities of the lushness inside the cave. Sunlight and oxygen entered the cave through magical means, and air was magically clean and fresh. Rather than being cramped and static, the cave diversified magically and naturally, resulting expansions and contractions of earth everywhere in varying degrees of influence.\nShifting focus to the moment, the adventurers stood around, sharing lots of conversations in various groups, many people cross-talking.\nOne conversation involved four siblings and eight friends with a median age of 12 years old. As part of an adventurer group, they were forced to carry sacks in the journey. Exploring these sacks, they contained rocks, tools, monsters or their flesh, mana stones, spare gear and equipment, and many other items. Advancing to a more functional level, they helped with many menial tasks such as stacking items, buying food and other expendable resources, and moving and cleaning large magical artifacts, gears, and equipment by hand. Simultaneously, they traveled long distances uphill, through urban streets and rough terrain, and downhill on surefooted foot. In essence, these preteens and teenagers were in the heart of their formative stages, only evolving in their collaborative, cognitive, and physical competence overtime.\nOn a more inclusive note, they were the blueprint for the great horror of becoming a powerful adult full of great influence. Yet, their potentials extended wider, uniquely, comprehensively, and into more specializations.\nSpeaking of potential, not knowing who they were, they would do what they couldn’t do, becoming more than they were now, envisioning greatness more than they could see. Great power awaited them, power beyond anything they could imagine.\nReturning to their conversation, it was lively and amicable.\n“I only have—I’m poor. I only have sixty-five pesos.\n“To unbox a chest and earn godly weapons.”\n“Hi.”\n“Oh my gosh, who’s that, who’s that, who’s that!”\n“Oh my goodness.”\n“You’ll never get it.”\n“I heard eye, I heard eye, I heard eye.”\n“It’s, it’s, it’s, it’s the… it’s the guy. It’s the guy with the red and black checkered shirt and paper hat as a head. Doglist, man, doglist. Why are they flying?”\n“That? That? That?”\nMany conversations like this went on and on for hours. This was normal due to the adventurers’ close-knit setting. This was despite the fact that adventurers could die. With that said, close-knit conversations like this never made sense outside context, and the amount of inside jokes here was so deep that even the people involved sometimes forgot the context and found it funny anyway.\nRevisiting the monsters and the magical lush cave, they made the adventurers that much more systematic, methodical, and rigorous in their behavior when facing the cave environment, which contrasted with their irreverent personalities in everyday environments. Moreover, since the cave was very dark and had dangerous terrain, the adventurers were using light magic to maintain their eyes’ habituation to the sunlight and clear up the darkness.\nOne of the monsters stopped in front of the adventurers innocently, presenting an opportunity for one adventurer group to intervene and help, despite the fact that the adventurers violently intruded into their natural habitat.\nThis interaction was in line with the adventurers’ goals of preparing and entering fiercely and then relaxing afterwards. So whatever happened was the adventurer parties either leaving the cave, exploring it, resting inside and having a picnic, and standing around and waiting for other groups to leave alongside them, among others. The adventurers showed great flexibility even in large groups, but that was partly because their military strength was excessive.\nMeanwhile, the boys and Millie were waiting patiently, taking a backseat, as the miners stopped their operations in case of an incident involving the adventurers.\nEven though the fortifications were still broken and only patched up with the limited skills of the miners, they were satisfied.\nAs soon as the adventurer groups began to leave and the miners who guided the adventurers and the miners who stayed reunited, it was already night.\nMillie was glad that today was slow, because she needed to be there to help fight monsters in the night. So she retired and said goodbye to the boys, which left the boys disappointed and lost.\nThe world was so fast, and their influence on the past events was minimal even though the mining operation leader Leroy seemed to trust them.\nAfter complaining about their day, they decided to go home and see if Leroy called them again.\nSince they were absent the next day, Leroy thought they quit, but he decided to send a messenger to them just in case. This was on day 4.\nWhen the boys got the message asking them why they were absent, they told the messenger that Leroy was silent yesterday about what they should do, which left them confused and lost. Even Millie’s silence on the issue left them unmotivated.\nSo they thought they should just return to everyday labor, even if it was boring and humiliating.\nBut Leroy’s messenger assured them that he was willing to give them a second chance and even give them an exciting job this time, so the boys accepted.\nIn contrast to his supportive attitude toward the boys, Leroy was furious about the adventurers, but he kept silent yesterday because officials told him to keep his hands off and stay away from his own mining operation site. He thought these officials were stupid because he would have helped them out for a price. Their inconsistency in their treatment toward the adventurers was appalling to him. Why did they express that they would address the adventurer hegemony by cutting funding, penalizing anticompetitive behavior, enforcing regulatory oversight, promoting market diversification, and supporting new entrants to the mining community? Rumors among his fellows even circulated of whistleblowers getting offed secretly. But at the same time, they showed times where they were capable of putting down groups who were unfairly taxing local businesses.\n“What a joke!”\nIn the end, he might be no better, hiring the boys since they were cost-effective but also resembled his own desperation when he was younger. He was an altruistic person, but it often came at the cost of his business, which was why he risked his life everyday in such an isolated, risky field of work. But it was true that these kids were more than just the result of his charity and the desperate situation he was in with the attack of the goblins. They were street smart, agile, had the potential to be skilled if they kept coming to work, and provided unique perspectives that he was willing to embrace.\nSo the boys would be joining hundreds of other boys like them shortly at a particular site. This time, he would be transparent regarding the operation and how they could contribute and be promoted. But it was essential that they came into the operation with disappointed expectations. This way, he could grab the most willing individuals. He was unconventional in his hiring decisions that way. But he was only one of many “biting heads” or pillars of the industry, which meant that he was risking his neck just to get “juicy” or high-value laborers, since he often liked to feign vulnerability, disingenuous but rational and innovative. His rationale came from the lack of more objective measures or hiring criteria, among other reasons, especially considering that magic potential was so random and lopsided.\nSo the readily available kids represented a consistent labor supply but also the rare possibility of one of them being “epic loot” in terms of magical prowess. This put a game-like gambling element to his hiring decisions. This was a typical concern, as it was often linked to kids whose rare magical potential a company realized quitting these same companies and becoming adventurers due to a lack of established loyalty. So he was already engendering his own method of ingraining faithfulness into his laborers, even addressing them as members as if in a community or family. Yet, he had good intentions, relying on empathy to make all of this function.\nWhen the three boys Billy, Shadrach, and Notch arrived, they saw Millie standing near over a hundred of boys gathered and conversing noisily.\nSince Leroy invited the three boys so earnestly, the boys got their parents to join them and even some friends. In fact, they brought eighteen people in total, which was outside Leroy’s expectations, forcing him to arrange a feast before an orientation instead of an orientation before a feast. He expected them to be hungrier, since people in the lower classes often forwent lunch and walked by foot, taking longer routes to avoid the short ones that the freemen or those high-born took.\nOnce the more than a hundred boys arrived, it was always joke time, and they were throwing jokes and laughing like a bunch of archers desperately shooting at their enemies in a siege.\nIn the background, providing solace to the boys, the sound of the wind and the hundreds of laborers that only wanted to get back to their own sufficient worlds married, resulting in a bouquet of hope.\nThe boys gathered together, forgetting the memories of the smell of urban waste, finding ceasefire in their dynamics just for a moment. They were all on the same side, facing the great Leroy. But each moment was a test to their patience and incompatibility with each other, arising from the growing tensions of coming of age. They would soon recognize their unique power to change uniquely their circumstances and seize self-expression. They would survive the new age (their era) and supercede the leaders of a generation ago.\nWithin their highly complex, magically communicative, urban society full of economic and social disparities, some of them might recognize themselves on the side of naturally emerging counterculture movements.\nThe war on monsters would only help promote cultural debate.\nAs for the boys’ connection to adventurers as both “outsiders” of society, Considering how free they were in expressing themselves upon their society and world, the adventurers to whom these boys looked up as rebels were, arguably, on the side of the status quo, debuting as humble regular people who became empowered as the voice of the people. The amount of power these adventurers held in changing the world aligned more with a hegenomy than that of “vigilantes fighting against corruption”. Their biting sarcasm and sensational straightforwardness only made them more relatable and trustworthy than those bureaucrats who fussed too much about “due process” in criminal proceedings, pocketing taxes, and systematizing policies.\nThough, the adventurers were a broad category, and the argument that they were a hegenomy and on the side of the status quo was based on the words of certain reporters, thinktanks, and public intellectuals or figures, among others, rather than that of the entire city outside the adventurer sphere.\nDespite the complexity of society, the boys felt a bond stronger than any shadow to each other, even if it would only last a “lifetime” of 6 years.\nToday, the boys occupied several roles and considerations: moving several bags from point A to point B, having an interconnection between several subgroups between the boys to compensate for the the dividing nature of the land topography, an interplay of various roles that occupy the “tweening” or in-betweens of the flow of the operation, the consideration of the health of each boys by various appointed “health inspectors”, the three-buddy system of three boys in one bag-carrying group, among others, and food being the least concern since the boys were expected to be more hardy in respect to their more physically promising background and age. As for why it was the three-buddy system rather than the more commonly heard two-buddy system, it was much more easier to detect power dynamics from afar when three people were involved than if it was “balanced” with only two. A four-buddy system would only make things undesirably “balanced” again, and a five-buddy system was excessive in number for the purpose of the system in the first place.\nLeroy was the architect of this complexity, but it was like breathing and sleeping to him. Oh, he loved sleeping and seeing people do it, and that was for his age (nearing 50 years old) as well.\nThis was a political move on the chess board, as even 1,000 bottom-rung people were as noisy as a flock of geese having a feud. But first and foremost, he was a business magnate and investor. He shaped energy and environmental policies, but apart from his other political activities, to which he referred as “minor” in a dialectical discussion, he held no political office. His actions broke boundaries, as the money thing that businesses cared about, economics, predicted offices.\nMeanwhile, the boys, the health inspectors, the new “enforcers” that Leroy had appointed from the group, and Leroy were finally done with their food, concluding the feast. With the roles given selectively to the boys during the feast, the orientation would detail their roles.\nThen, they would easily find themselves getting to productive, fulfilling work in no time. They only needed someone to tell them what to do, following like a kind and patient guide. Leroy was too busy and easily tired to do that, so he had the enforcers work together with the health inspectors, who then became the sub-messengers in the hierarchy that included Leroy’s inner circle of messengers.\nAs for Millie, she was obviously an enforcer, and she was not the only woman or girl there. In particular, several other women were present, being former soldiers. Millie was an exception, being the youngest and the only one who relied on her military police father’s guidance on combat rather than on formal soldiery.\nThe boys were having a rough time trying to escape the eyes of the “enforcers” that Leroy appointed from the group. Now, they were just hoping for bread, just one. They only needed one bite.\nWhen it comes to their plan, they wanted to establish first intelligence of the other boy subgroups. If they could know where they were headed and how they were planning to do it—whether defensive, aggressive, fast, slow, big, or soft—they would be able to make decisions much more precisely. Of course, they were casual about it, speaking in terms that they used when playing children’s games as stemming from a background coincident with marginalized homeless day laborer groups.\nLeroy was observant, so he immediately sorted the group’s dynamics before the boys started to recognize underlying patterns in his operation. If he wanted them to succeed on the first try, he would let them, but he wanted to see them flexibly try, which meant managing frustration and learning how to stay emotionally intelligent both intra- and inter-personally. The productive aspect was dependent on this.\nThis was antagonistic toward the success of the operation, but this was his final test. He was the king of tests, and he would make sure that they experienced life’s suffering first hand—to prepare them for what was coming ahead.\nThe death of Maverick and that of his associate laborers were more than just elements of a tragic accident on the papers. It could have been prevented through beast-centric pilot facilities, test environments, and places of creative expression of skill, and Billy, Shadrach, and Notch could have lived more normal lives. But there was always room for improvement. They would strive, until they could become the managers.\nChapter 6 - Embracing Emancipation linkFrom the boys’ perspective, the tension was brewing like a pot left on the fire. The time was ticking, and they were beginning to lose sweat. Sweat was beginning to expire, and their patience too. What came next was their words becoming strung along with negativity. They started spewing words of antipathy. They would grab their fellow and evoke annoyed expressions of malice. They should not, but they did because they were unable to release their tensions. They were still young teenagers, but they had to grow, even if they emphasized they were adulting. They would not sit idly and watch their fellows suffer; they would stand up and represent themselves upon this world. They would manifest their destinies in this land. Their friends and families would know that they were themselves. They would claw their way to the city heights.\nThe sound of whispers fled the mouths of these children and entered the ears of those who had prepared flexibly. This time, they would recognize where they stood.\nThey bolted, chasing shadows of other boys. At this moment, they would intercept them and provide aid, seizing the right to glory by deposing those complacents.\nThe system was functioning well, but each trinkle toward the end made sure that they were nothing but rabbits in the forest crying for help. They knew that they had to move.\nThey moved, launching out of the bushes and vegetations. The trees watched their steps.\nVarious boys clapped hands at the interconnections within their group of subgroups.\n“Let’s go!”\n“Hurray!”\n“Alright!”\nThe goal was to make sure this operation succeeded amid the manipulations of the wise Leroy.\nHe was not happy with pretending to be a bystander, so he took action.\nA flurry of movements were shadows eating each other. Nothing stood in the way of their rush. They would cast the weight of emotional burden from themselves. Today, they would stride.\nThud, thud, thud. Like wind clapping hands in the wind, they signalled each other their next steps using their child tactics. But their wisdom was unparelled within their subgroups, for familiarity breeded the quickness of dissemination. Faster, the boys were elevated beyond the shadows, and their steps skipped higher than the shadows of the trees. They wouldn’t let roots nor branches uphold them. They were godlike in their maneuvering.\nTime moved. It was everpresent. Why? It heard that it was, and it was.\nThe boys were not happy with the time moving too quickly in their eyes. They made it to the end of their journeys, each an ending and a start within the sequence between point A and B.\nHappening like a cacophony of cannons, they were done, a breeze of joy flying before they could say ha.\nMeanwhile, Billy, Shadrach, Millie, and Notch attended, their friendly faces taking supremacy.\nAnyway, Leroy was pleased with the result, but he saw the process in which they achieved this result as disgustingly unskilled. What a skill issue.\nNo one complained. If they wanted to, they would get disposed of immediately. It was sarcastically nice knowing that their entire lives depended on some really ambitious people who might have empathy but would behave callously anyway.\nA moment of silence slowly marked the division between boss and laborers. And it would be great if time stopped for them to breathe, but they were already hearing their names being called one by one by the messengers of Leroy. It was already time for them to stay or leave. Whatever happened next was up to the hiring decision-making of Leroy himself. He would decide who left or stayed.\nThe time was ticking, and Notch was too upset with the fact that he tripped. Millie was concerned with her quality of movement, as she was taught dancing techniques. If she performed like a wet rag, then she was a wet rag. Ew. Anyway, Billy was busy struggling to stand, his legs hurting like somebody ran a magical spinning tapering tip into it. His mind was in the “no more where am I where am I”. Shadrach was completely wasted, lying down on the ground, and the only signs of life were his oscillating chest. Everything else—from his gaping mouth, still eyes, limp limbs, and awkward position in the middle of what was supposed to be a serious formal situation—said dead.\nThis was the result of their mightiest effort. What a joke.\nYet, Leroy was clapping.\nWhy was he clapping?\nThe boys were already discussing among themselves, even if they knew they could get punished for it. They were already decided that if they stayed or leave, they would keep their ego anyway.\nEgo was everything, to be clear.\nIf they gained nothing, they would still spit at their oppressors. Who were they to be treated like little immature brats? Ha, if Leroy realized how much they actually knew, he would beg and cry for mercy. They were sure of themselves. It was that simple.\nMeanwhile, Leroy was sharing his fair share of praise for the boys, whom he saw as contributing to his understanding of how to make sure he minmaxed this entire operation. He was that confident in them.\nHis confidence in himself was self-evident.\nTime moved, and the boys were gone. Leroy was already itching due to the insects.\nThe sounds of the forest were like moments of release and reminders of how troublesome staying in the forest for too long was without any kind of remedy for the minor but very bothersome moments of it.\nTime felt like it resumed again when Notch and the other two boys and Millie recognized that that they were walking up again to Leroy as part of a new established labor force consisting of 60 boys.\nLeroy was fair he said. He thought that if anyone needed help, he would provide it. But he was a person with his own interests, so he wouldn’t stretch himself backward for someone who didn’t even want his help.\nToday was awesome day—win-win!\nLeroy stepped forward, his steps like the beating sky.\nTaking on a tone that sounded both genuine and sarcastic, he said: “Okay, now with the problems over, I want to address everything that’s going on fully. We have several different sections. I did say that in the orientation, but um, if you guys want a serious… deconstruction of my entire operation. You’re going to climb up the ranks because…” He chuckled while speaking. “… people are crazy. I mean…” He waved his hand dismissively. “People need to be crazy. You know, motivated. We love the motivated people. They are crazy-incredible! I’ve seen them—magnificent individuals. Now, that sounds a little bit underhanded, but I’m serious now. We have to emancipate ourselves completely. That is my philosophy—emancipation. You get me?” His smug and sarcastic voice bloomed. “Now with that philosophical tangent over, I want you guys to look at me seriously. We’ve established that you guys are the ones, but you’re more than just the ‘oneness’. You’re going to need ‘awesomesomeness’, and I’m not saying that in a joking way. You guys need actual guts, you know. Please, just let me just finish the job by asking you—each of you—a very good question—precise and delicate. Do you care about what’s happening here? Do you see everything that I put? The trees, the plants…” He glanced to the side with thought. “The vegetation.\n“Uh, I know you guys are not that observant, which is why I’m very disappointed when I saw none of you praising my divine work! My plants are so well-organized and tended to: I can’t believe none of you considered them. I am so good at getting everyone together right? Anyway, the ones that remain here are only here because I decided so. I have a choice thing here to make, so I’m going to choose 30 more to handle the plants and the rest to handle the actual mining operation. There is no escaping this, because I’ve already made sure that your past jobs reject me automatically. No one likes any of you.” He was lying about this and the rejection thing, but he liked a good test. It’s not like he wasn’t sure that they could see through him. But who cares? The simple reason he was so expressive right now was that he finally achieved his goal. He was just savoring the loot—the exclusive labor force—he got, an overflow of excitement scattering his solemn eloquence.\nBasically, Leroy had five primary objectives for the boy group: their recognition of “emancipation”, motivated and dedicated individuals, appreciation of nature, separation into two subgroups, and loyalty and commitment.\nHis philosophy of emancipation could be phrased as such: “Humanity shall become epitomized through its representative individuals.”\nHe wanted to pull the wheat from the chaff, and the chaff he wanted to protect the safety and happiness of. This was in the sense that he would help individuals fulfill respective roles as part of a community that relied on a variety of roles, perspectives, and personalities. He would create destroy establishments that promote division and exclusivity through his own, as he saw himself as a disruptive innovator, that which generated social progression and partnered with the miners’ union.\nWith Leroy being a titanic force upon the boy group that included some women and girls, Billy, Shadrach, Millie, and Notch stood by. They were productive, tacitly waiting for opportunities. Meanwhile, they awaited their pending new roles as more formally established members of Leroy’s force.\nWith magic, Leroy was able to contact several different hidden messengers. He motioned them to alert laborers who were specialized in handling crucial bureaucratic paperwork. The alert would be about the formalization and integration process for the boy group. This marked its putting in effect. However, when it came to magic use, usually, he had a preference for the natural (without magic) mode of communication instead. But he was too in-the-moment to go home where he could do it.\n“Alright!” He waited before he had everyone’s full attention again. “We’re leaving, okay?”\nBilly was already tired, wishing that Leroy was done. He respected the guy, but he was already in the need to rest and massage his legs. Shadrach was practically crawling, and the fact that Leroy ignored him was characteristic of his lenience and patience despite his formal background. Millie was having trouble dealing with headaches, as her sweat was no longer there, since she was very thirsty. If she got water before she started standing in the heat out of fear of Leroy’s burst of expressiveness, then maybe she would be alright. But she knew that her position as part of a marginalized group of women was only going to be miserable. She had much less power, as laborers were often men, garnering more respect since they were outside and voicing themselves at every waking moment. Woman stayed inside often, making it harder for them to connect and express themselves. This made her feel the weight of her insignificance to others. They respected her fighting to some degree, but they always treated it like a spectacle, not some normal soldier thing that everyone did. Her concerns were that of some person. Despite the improvements of magic in connecting others and her belief that it was only going to be so much time before women could be treated as normal yet themselves, she still felt dismissed and like an outsider. Notch was busy eating fried chicken that he bought from a wandering trader. He liked it, but so did Millie.\nThe fried chicken was more than just food. It was a symbol of wealth. And Notch was throwing all his funds to buying it. The fact that he even had it spoke volumes about his new influence on the boys.\nThis was his way of expressing his power, and they all glanced at him, feeling meager and left out. But they had their own cards up their sleeves at re-gathering themselves and getting revenge through success—wealth.\nThe dungeon was like one million times more complex in terms of how all these dynamics would shape up by the time it took central stage.\nBilly and Shadrach felt warm and comfortable, even if they saw that Notch’s simple action of eating fried chicken made others feel left out, because they were worried that addressing the issue would only break the peace. Even if this peace was fragile, they preferred it over dirty chaos.\nIncidentally, Millie was just following the boys’ lead again, because she wanted to fit in.\nWhen Millie interrupted the peace by asking formally and politely for water, the boys were happy to help, showing her their collection of three wooden bottles.\nMillie was almost astounded, feeling the same as the boys toward something trivial like wooden bottles. But to her and the boys, they were sharing magic. In the end, they only had so much childhood to savor before they were adults. By the time they were adults, they only had so much time to live. This was their life—a mix of humor, sorrows, and tales of becoming just like the main characters of a fairy tail on the horizon. All it took was imagination, and the wooden bottles were magic.\nChapter 7 - Trials in the Dungeon linkAfterwards, in the progress of returning to their hovel homes, they walked long distances.\nThe sound of flutes, drums, moving cloths and fabric, and stringed instruments guided them homeward through the streets of their district. It was a place where hundreds of colors blended like a sea mustering its strength and breathing out all the fish in it. Breaths of white smoke wafted, crying out throughout the blue night sky. The momentary calls of women and men, as they walked as if they danced. It was a morning glory.\nBillie, Shadrach, Millie, and Notch lost to Leroy who made himself the highlight. A degree of frustration was added to the boiling pot each of their unique and individual hierarchy of needs in friction with the colliding needs of their society, new organization, certain people, and each other.\nTomorrow, they would find challenges at the intraorganizational level, involving internal dynamics between members, with Leroy emerging as a central figure.\nYet, even with all of this, they had to go to a dungeon.\nThe next morning, on day 5, Leroy requested that they visit a dungeon, forgoing any mention of mining and gardening. “What happened?” Leroy asked for them. “Well, it’s crucial that you know exactly what I want. The dungeon should show you how complex mining actually is. The mining operations I showed you all were those in isolated locations, so security was not a priority because I don’t care what happens to them. I only require that my main and most important operations remain intact and working well. The dungeons? That’s where they intersect.”\nMeanwhile, in the heat, Billy wanted to take a shower at a river now that Leroy had him as a member. If Leroy could do so much, maybe Billy could swim in a river for the first time in his life.\nMillions felt similar to Billy. He represented them.\nIn front of Billy, Leroy was staying instead of leaving.\nHis new labor force required a change of lifestyle, so he was actively using magic to keep himself cool. He was used to doing this, but it was only now that he decided to change his lifestyle.\nLeroy was a highly organized individual, so he immediately composed himself to communicate succinctly his plan for them to proceed to the dungeons methodically. If they failed to do so, they would have to return, or else they would die. Monsters often occupied the hidden cavities of the cave, and they could easily use magic to create them and break walls to ambush and escape quickly. He was no fool. These monsters were no fool.\nHe tripped down on a flight of mountain stairs.\nThe 60 boys in front of him stared at him, finding his posture ridiculous.\nHe stood up and took a deep breath.\n“Okay.” Now that he was balanced, he could address his falling. “It’s been a while since I’ve spent this much time going outside. I apologize.”\nThe boys found his apology even more ridiculous, but their respect for him stayed. They refrained from pondering the nuance of his words or actions. They just listened, obeyed, filled their needs, and left. That was their life. Loyalty to establishments was not something that weighed their hearts. Instead, they were loyal to their families, shouldering yet declining the expectations of society.\nLeroy’s prominence was getting annoying to them, so they just focused on the essential contents of his directions.\nWhen the boys reached the cave, Leroy was talking about a bunch of scientific-sounding stuff.\nHe had some of them squat down on one side, another on another side, another on another side, and another on another side: four subdivisions in total.\nHe was preparing them for a monster.\nLeroy quickly pointed out the monster when it arrived.\nThrough the positions, the boys eliminated the time it took to away and to where the monster was depending on its relative position.\nThey guaranteed a spear strike to its left jaw that became injured when it tripped. If they were more proficient, they would strike with more precision and maybe do it a combo with three strikes.\nLeroy was smirking, finding the whole thing hilarious. The heat was affecting him too.\nThe monster was turning left and right, dodging attacks, but it considered that its mass and fur only contributed to its movements more reliant on swift but brief engages rather than endurance hunting.\nIt made fake charges, scaring the boys to make space for him to retreat.\nWhen it escaped, Leroy was furious. Yeah, he was heated.\nThe tropical sun graced the ground, each pore on the rocky ground like a precious gem expressing the love of gods.\nThe boys were exhausted, so they stared at this beauty.\nLeroy finished, remarking that the sun was too hot.\nThe boys won, sweat dripping down their nose and tickling them.\nThe beast lost, passively hiding in a cavity.\nLeroy clapped his hands perfunctorily, but his negativity was superficial too. He knew how to manage his emotions. He just liked to express himself to communicate.\nIn relation to the whole dungeon thing, even if the boys were intended to be members originally of a mining operation, Leroy showed them that miners had to organize themselves well. The difference between a trekker and a hunter was similar to miners and adventurers. A trekker still had to know how to engage with a bear, even if it was there to trek rather than hunt. Similarly, a miner had to engage with a random monster using grouping.\nThe boys, of course, thought that dealing with monsters was a waste of time since this was commonly seen as unattached to the job description of a miner. But Leroy emphasized that even if they would mine for years without dealing with a monster, he said that it equipped them with valuable analytical and problem-solving skills and that learning how to deal with monsters solved complex problems across various fields. In conclusion, monster problems were everywhere.\nAdventurers and monster hunting were often the limelight, so most of the boys were excited at first. But the fatal nature of dealing with monsters sobered them up.\nOnly several boys actually attacked the monster; the rest froze up with confusion, having fully seen themselves as factually capable of striking and killing the beast. They thought that their background of humiliation and desperation would translate well to a seasoned fighter. But they were like naked babies facing the judgment of irrational parents—childhood memories of deathly sorrow.\nThey were back to their worst days of their life, helpless again.\nWhat did they do wrong? What haven’t they done?\nThey did everything. And yet, they were disrespected by reality.\nThose who were already terrified before the monster encounter were not disappointed. They were better off than those who felt helpless in their cognitive dissonance. At least, they were not disappointed.\nThose who recognized that they were helpless way before the encounter were even more better off. For one, they assessed the danger of monsters well, but in particular, they emphasized self-awareness of their limitations and frailty. Primarily, these ones, as long as they were agonizingly optimistic, were most likely to succeed under Leroy’s direction.\nThe groups immediately saw tensions, as the boys were already comparing each other’s reactions. This stimulated the inherent tensions between the group and the helplessness each boy felt. They were trying to make up for this by acting out, since the eloquence that Leroy had was out of their reach anyway. What they were doing was right. They were communicating. But they were limited clearly, resulting in physical fighting, which they often did when they were angry.\nThe physical fighting helped them experiment with each other’s sense of control and shake the dynamics up. But, it sored relations between some of the boys. The rest of the boys were able to displace their anger, resulting in some perceived tension release. But this was still dangerous, unpredictable, violent, and self-destructive.\nFortunately, Leroy intervened with his guards, stopping the dynamics where they now were.\nAny punch not taken resulted in a certain mutual understanding. The person who got the last punch in was obviously considered to be dominant or, at least, the perpetrator. The person who fought the best were now the “leaders” of the group. These dynamics distracted the boys from the monster and returned them to suffering they were at least familiar with. But this was very painful.\nHonestly, Leroy thought they were goofy because they cared so much about things that didn’t matter. If they were adults who spoke and acted judiciously, they would be competing over more productive things rather than just being good at punching other people. Competition was good if it was productive, so working together, despite tensions, if it benefited both parties was a key difference of mature adults from these boys. Though, he was generalizing, as respective context still mattered.\nDang, though, the boys were very entertaining to watch. Reality was often more hilarious than fiction. Though, he did wonder if these boys would live up to the exertion of power typical of adventurers and trolls.\nEarlier, 60 boys from various distinct parties fought. It started a member of a party of four boys saying something about someone and his party which had attacked the monster. They were saying it with the intention of getting the last word in and leaving. But one of the other members of the latter party went and confronted the speaker face-to-face. This resulted in the former party walking away while mocking the latter party. Meanwhile, the latter party followed and kept addressing the issue confrontationally. This resulted in some physical interaction through touching and tapping and then grabbing and pushing. When it got to pulling, that was when the fighting started. Other boys began to join in aggressively because of the fact that most of them disliked that people were mocking the party that had attacked the monster. But the problem was that the boys were not doing it to avenge this party. They were doing it because the parties consisted not of friends alone but of circumstantial buddies. The members were originally from various friend groups, so it became a fight of diversity once friendships got involved.\nAs for the action aspect of the fight, it was very complex and long. Each boy had certain mannerisms of fighting, and certain groups were in the right place at the right time to get the kick out of demolishing other groups in the wrong place at the right time. Listing each action would be perplexing considering how each action rippled across the various parties, each of which detached often and complexified the dynamics even more.\nThe boys were different people by the time they finished fighting.\nThe monster was a catalyst to this fight. Very impactful, both the monster encounter and the fight made Leroy pause and reflect, while the boys sat as if pretending to be dead.\nLeroy could easily sweep the issue under a rug, but he knew that the boys were only useful if composed, not repressed and depressed. Similar to addressing the issues that adults demand to be solved, addressing the issues of the boys and then solving them would make him a much more effective leader, because they would flock under his name. He would be their banner. He would be their god. If not their god, then their god would bless him, and he would be a representation of their god’s actions here on this world.\nEither way, he was merely stating an emotive hypothesis. If he truly wanted to be a god, he would have to spend a million years sitting all alone first at least. And that was what he was going to do.\nImmortality was on the menu.\nSoon, fried chicken was Leroy’s weapon, and he ate them alongside the boys, resolving the tensions between them somewhat. He gave them wealth, and he gave them a sense of freedom. He was their banner, and he would unite them under himself.\nThis was where they truly found oneness—in his name.\nIf he gave the fried chicken earlier, they would not recognize that they themselves cannot find order through each other. They must rely on a much more authoritative entity, him.\nBut Billy, Notch, Millie, and Shadrach thought he was just a regular man with a lot of things under his belt. The boys all thought similarly.\nSimply, exaggerated self-importance strung him along.\nThe boys already saw so much shit in their life that someone like Leroy isn’t necessarily going to change that.\nThey only cared about concrete stuff like money and family, so the fried chicken was their only tie to Leroy. As soon as Leroy’s procurement of concrete stuff was over, they would leave.\nIf they wanted to have faith in a human, he would have to be a very remote, very symbolic, very historical established emperor. But Leroy was just a man.\nOne experience isn’t enough to make them piss their pants and go Mama all over Leroy, Leroy.\nMaybe, if he were to tie them together under an emperor or a god, they would see him respectfully in a manner befitting a priest or pastor. But to see him as a god? No, because that would be near sighted and condescending.\nWith all that said, Leroy and the monster lost. In his mind, he won.\nTwice, the boys won: once against the monster and again against Leroy, but with Leroy, it was bittersweet.\nAnyway, now that the boys were now united through hiking for meaningful hours, fending off a life-taking monster, grouping, punches, similar ages, and a shared background, among many factors, they would find themselves finally in the mines tomorrow.\nIn the background, Maverick’s life was still beating, because the society in which his death occurred and the factors for his death continue to permeate.\nChapter 8 - Into the Abyss: Descending into Darkness linkAt their leader’s command, the next day, on day 6, the boys gathered at a plaza, seeing many familiar faces. For the reason of this, they frequented the street, originally being borderline street children. With that said, the faces, mannerisms, styles of clothing, gait, and various kinds of everyday people were obvious to them. They each carried an eternity of knowledge that even scholars would cry to obtain, but they couldn’t eloquently express this.\nThe streets were like ten thousand tunnels, and these tunnels were like caves within caves within caves, each subset of a cavity just flying across numerous categories and such. An entire street was an “eternity line”, full of the existences that turned each person into a whole different person. Each person was that existence, and so was each object and each environmental factor. So when any existence changed, an explosion of colorful explosions, divided along and sometimes across a variety of walls, which were each indented, eroded, porous, or a combination of these in a complex manner. Humanity spread on these streets.\nBut the boys knew that experientially, rather than only with words or abstract imaginations. They understood this.\nThey were that humongous in size, and each step they made was that great, tittering, clasping, scowling, angry, maniacal, gravitating, searing, wretched noise.\nTheir leader saw them as poor creatures deserving sympathy.\nThe high-ranking clergy members; mages from various guilds, trade associations, craft organizations, fraternal lodges, cooperatives, unions, communities, and cultural and heritage organizations; adventurers of various factions and clans; and other variegated interlocutors of higher society might see them as problematic nosey little brats. Moreover, classism and racism were very prevalent and openly practiced like an open flood gate in the middle of daytime. It was slipped in between as subtext for the culturally equipped. It was a divisive sword that allowed people to retreat from their cognitive dissonances and focus on the high time of life. This was perfection, where it was most divisive, violent, and murderous. This was goodness, where it was most pronounced and treacherous, where it was most painful and heartbreaking. This was (heaven-ordained, cold, logical, intelligent, meditative, humble, defiant) enlightenment—the Lord of the Realm. (His eye cast a shadow upon his hellish domain, terrorizing those who imagine him.)\nMeanwhile, Billy idly stared at the shop stalls, each movement of his finger expressed his discontent with staying too long in dry season. Several months from now, wet season would come again. That would result in him being a happier boy.\nHe was walking alongside the group, so he was doing more than just staring.\nBeside him, Notch was grabbing apples and buying them, showing how much wealthier he was. He got some early cash from his leader for being a good boy in general. He never asked why specifically.\nMillie was happy to be in front, trying to guard and protect the boys from the sun in the east. Though, she immediately started losing her composure—though in a casual manner—when they turned away from the sun into another street. To fix this issue, she was happy to be on the right side of the boys, but her body was not wide enough to cover them all. She was contemplating problems that the boys were ignorant of. But she felt happy trying anyway. This morning made her optimistically simple.\nPassing by Millie, Shadrach was caressing his shoulder. He was still new to lying down after he pushed himself yesterday. His body still ached, and many other boys near him similarly ached and looked numb.\nThe 57 other boys in the group, which included the several women, had similarly unique distinctions between them. Therefore, it was a noisy group with its own commanding presence, which passed by many other groups of power. Time was counting down, and the longer people spent time together, the higher the chance for collaboration and competition. The boys were already networking, which, to them, was just talking casually, but they were reaching out, grabbing a bunch of sand, and tossing it around like a child would.\nTen hundred words were said in the span of several minutes. The boys were doing good work by just existing.\nTheir leader was happy about this, so he just watched them grow like slimes collecting biomass.\nThe boy characters grew, and their strength tripled again and again. Their words were like swift knives that cut through fish and around bone. It was succinct, pleasurable, and, most of all, vivid. Their strength of communication multiplied, as they were considering their places as part of a group. Overall, the effective depth of their group multiplied their networking strength.\nAs soon as the networking collapsed into refreshing, lightweight goodbyes, the leader was clapping more than perfunctorily. He was smiling genuinely.\nAs for the result of their networking, it amounted to 47 new friends, 20 new contacts, and 15 new enemies. Productive, this included the enemies, because they provide a bountiful set of “yum-yums”: motivation, awareness of strengths and weaknesses, resilience, refinement of priorities, competitive edge, learning opportunities in general, and potential friends.\nNow, these numbers only considered whom the boys believe to be relevant enough to count. Moreover, the details of their interactions were a dish of fresh flavors, full of new insights. This would be challenging to take account of, which is why they would rather just summarize it with one quantitative sentence.\nA list of names jotted down and slipped into a pouch was enough for their leader.\nIt was a job success.\nBut their goal was to mine, yet their leader was open to seeing how the boys could do so much more than just mining. He was riding on a trend right now, and if this trend popped like an economic bubble, he would just jump right out. He had the money to do so.\nThe boys were play things to him. He recognized that this thought was extremely crazy, reacting to himself.\nThe boys established themselves well enough into this chasm of society. Their leader could only pretend for so long before his mind collapsed on itself in a crawl toward the recognition of their great prowess.\nThe location of the mines opened up a new field, despite the contrasting eyes between the boys, the boy group and their environment, the boy group and their leader, and the boys with their selves as part of a group, among others.\nIt ignored these contrasting eyes to mislead the boys into thinking they were free. But they brought their problems with them.\nThey would have to navigate this horror.\nThe control would be so sweet—magic, magic, magic.\nAt the mines, the boys were almost like toys.\nThe could only see the world through their static eyes. The darkness covered every periphery, and the only thing they could do was blink. Gradually, the darkness began to mold the objects within it into clarity. It was like Death itself had a say in determining whether they would pass or not. The objects provided a plane in which they could walk, but who knew if Death would remove their meaning and thus remove this plane. They were only alive right now because Death allowed them.\nThis was how the boys saw the dark.\nA world full of hopes lay behind the darkness, and they wanted to leap into the void.\nOne more step.\nA boy fell.\n“Argh!’\nA man watching them from behind grabbed the boy and prevented him from falling further.\nTheir leader was the man, and he was furious. “Don’t take two steps at once! I know you’re nervous, but keep your steady!”\nThe boy was still falling, because his mind saw that he was falling. His body was safe, but his mind was still falling far away. So, it manifested in terror.\n“Argh! Arghhhhhh! Ayah! Aaaaaaaaaa!”\nIt was too late for him to cry. He was already crying.\nThough, he was only a boy, aged 14, but he was already being tossed into a cave. The dungeon he went into yesterday was a big one, but it was organized. This cave was not. It was similar to how an embrace might either represent great danger or great order. If someone embraced you from behind, would you look?\nThat is the feeling of being in the lightest part of the cave while everything else is dark. One more step, and any semblance of humanity would become lost in ethereal beauty.\nHeaven would be there.\nThe boy shut the abstraction of this world up, and he ventured forward out of the hands of his oppressor, the leader who revealed both his and the boy’s vulnerability by caring for him. Vulnerability was best hidden in the dark, so he walked into it. The darkness enclosed him like a letter in an envelope. He was perfectly still, representing the dark and becoming it.\nHe was a boy changed from shadow to shadow. His shadow now coincided with the voluminous cave’s.\nIf he lost his anxiety and emotional resonance, that could be concerning. This was why his triumph over the source of his anxiety had a smirk attached.\nHe just knew well how well he struggled to get to where he was.\nThis boy returned to his group: his name was Robert.\nTheir leader, who was Leroy and whose full name was Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair, was already sending the boys deeper into the cave one by one.\nNathaniel addressed the problems of many other boys before this and helped them accustom themselves to the cave, considering that the mines here were much more darker.\nAs for why this was the case, Nathaniel chose a darker entrance. the method of multiple entrances were easier to maintain than using only one big entrance. Having one entrance was fine, but multiple entrances were just the natural result of not wanting to go the whole way to the entrance or losing track of the location of the entrance. So using magic to make a new entrance was more effective in the long run, considering that these entrances were temporary anyway. Overall, his focus was on just getting in and getting out rather than trying to have a well-established entrance. Of course, multiple entrances meant that most of these entrances were darker because they were less established as formal passages. Basically, the main entrance was highly intricate in providing organized ramps and such for the formal mining process. In contrast, multiple entrances were beneficial for free lance or independent, powerful miners who could handle themselves and preferred the exclusivity.\nThis was why it was especially tricky to locate goblins. They could hide in cavities for hours like a much more secretive foxhole, and they could break down walls with magical tools, creating paths and navigating around the cave through paths that they and miners had created. This was more than just a rabbit warren in complexity. This was extremely dynamic and flexible. But this ease was limited to the higher levels. The lower the level, the denser and harder the materials were. This happened very quickly, as magic was the only reason for the malleability of the materials. Namely, the mantle of the world was too dynamic in a very powerfully magical way to allow any kind of lower grade magic to affect it. In conclusion, the hierarchy of magical influences in the cave aspect was a vast landscape full of various features. Go sightseeing!\nAnyway, now that the boys were going around the cave, it was the smallest thing in the world. This was similar to a cat whenever it entered through small gaps or lay down atop curved spearheads of fences, the actual mass of the size of the cat much smaller than what its fur presented it to be.\nWhen this feeling came to light, the boys already knew this was their new field of play.\nA mixed-species group of 65 batbogs (toed bats with prehensile wings) flew around outside of their home range. Their objectives as a community related to recognizing how delicious the trespassing boys were. These boys’ curious’ group, behavior, community structure, and the protection of these boys were what was tasty. Even if they belonged to a forest, the batbogs were relevant details of the environment where the boys travelled. Their sounds texturizing the atmosphere, the batbogs, simpler than humans in eloquence, communicated with musical variations, a variety of sounds and patterns.\nIf eye-singers (birds with chirps that made their targets’ eyes burn) could observe humans, why shouldn’t batbogs? If a dragon should breathe fire under the night sky, why should not the batbogs see its light and express their feelings going by?\nA few danderlions (tall bipedal beasts with fast-growing fur) and eye-singers were located in a cave, but it was in a different forest, one of multiple key identifiable environments within the world.\nAfter listening to the vocalisation of an eye-singer bird, Millie sat down. She was tired from joining the adventurers and hunters in taking down the monsters of the night, since the large-scale departure of the adventurers who had arrived and left quickly like the memory of a terrifying thunderstorm.\nNow, she liked listening to them, yet the vocalization sounded unique every time.\nThe reason for this was the loss of genetic diversity. This happened primarily because of the small size of each of the multiple founding populations of eye-singers when they were introduced here in this land from another land overseas.\nHer eyes began to burn as if an onion was in front of her eyes.\nHer presence here as merely one component of a broad evolution of “founding” choices made her relax. Fitting in, being normal yet unique, and being the result of factors were calming ideas to her.\nShe finished her thoughts before solving the issue, standing inside Nathaniel’s magical bubble where the eye-burning calls of eye-singers were mute. She struggled, fidgeting, as her eyes were already red. Next to the rest of the members of the boy group, she could only share in the distress that everyone experienced after hearing the chirp of the eye-singer. Nathaniel was apologetic.\nEveryone recognized that it was outside his expectations. Preparing the magical bubble earlier meant prediction, as it drained his mana to maintain. This was why he only did it now because he failed to predict the eye-singer’s emergence. This was his first use of mana of the day, but he was limited. To add to the trouble, the boys were children with no experience in magic, and the several women in the group were natural or physical fighters. This meant that this small trip to the mines was his responsibility. Instead of rejecting help, he got over a hundred of people to help him handle all the crucial background stuff, investing much time and funds into this. Moreover, he wanted to be present enough to answer personally any questions or needs the boys had though. But this was as far as he could go. A loyal work force of hundred or so highly skilled employees was hard enough to maintain. He had dangerous healing potions hidden for emergencies, but that was it.\nThis was the side of himself that he liked. This was emancipation (his philosophy).\nThe boys relied on him now—a tie that, if broken, had consequences.\nHe won, where he was weak.\nChapter 9 - The Eye-Springer’s Call and the Advent of Goldberg linkThe eye-springer’s voice was mute, so they were ignorant of its current location. But if they only heard it, they would know, but that would result in burning eyes.\nBefore Nathaniel could hastily sacrifice himself to locate the bird, a group of boys and women blocked him and told him that he needed to keep himself rooted in magical focus.\nHe was becoming excited. The satisfaction of being relied on was sweet.\nThe control was so sweet.\nThe boys had to stop him. He was becoming too friendly.\nSo the boys instead would use this kindness and take more challenging risks. This would balance things out.\nThe boys utilized what they have learned, they grouped up, releasing themselves one by one. Each one ran as far as they could before hearing the eye-springer’s call. Then, the next one came out, heading in another route to loacte the bird. This time, he tried to return to the bubble because he found out where the bird would be based on the sound. So even if his eyes were burning, he walked back to the bubble. He actively chose to stay close and follow a predetermined path earlier, so this paid off well, considering he was only the second one. The boys immediately found themselves out of the bubble, as Nathaniel fell to the ground. This changed their plans. Since the cave was very porous and full of gaps, they would probably still hear the sound even if they ran and hid behind walls and structural variations. They decided to run toward the bird and scare it away with their numbers. The bird saw them, but instead of running away, it only moved around in the portion of the cave, expecting the boys to give up and lose track of it.\nThe boys, including Billy, Notch, and Shadrach, were expected to make it go away or throw a rock at it to knock it unconscious. But no one was successful.\nNathaniel recognized that the boys had had enough, so he walked outside and grabbed a potion from an adjutant he had waiting, hearing the boys yelping and groaning the whole time. Then, before opening the potion, he walked and used his ears for a position where he could hurry directly to the bird. After the bird’s last call, he ran in one direction, falling and hurting himself.\nThis was a mess, so Nathaniel licked the potion liquid on the ground after it the potion container broke on impact. If he opened the potion out in the open, it would explode because of the air. Inside the cave, it was much less likely to explode. He healed his eyes and went out of the cave, meeting his adjutant and saying that he failed.\nThe adjutant nodded, handed Nathaniel the rest of his potions, and cast a spell that made him fast.\nHe ran, only to fall and hit his head after his eyes burned.\nAfter desperately making his adjutant drink a potion, Nathaniel chuckled before realizing that eye-singers should be avoided. He and his adjutant walked outside, realizing that the boys were stuck there.\nSo Nathaniel outsourced some adventurers as usual and part of standard to deal with the pesky eye-singer. He really outdid himself by being a hypocrite when he warned the boys about being flexible yesterday. Well, he did have to adapt to the boys’ weird behavior. They ruined his usual momentum, but he was at least open to their interruptions, considering that they did productive things during them. Even if his schedule and mood were affected, which was partly the reason for this disaster of a mining visit, he was content with the progress of having experienced failure alongside the boys and witnessed their unique, unsolicited contributions. Though, the definition of these contributions was that of potential since training new employees are still a crucial part of integrating them into the work force. But if they decided to quit, then this potential was imagined. In conclusion, he and the boy group shared a stronger bond now.\nIt was sarcastically hilarious how he had to accept that adventurers, being separate and broader forces from his boy group, could do things he couldn’t, despite the recent surge in tensions between him and them since their intrusion and vandalization in his mining operation site two days ago. He forwent outsourcing them before the mining visit today partly for this reason. Indeed, He got humiliated, but he was willing to take the loss, moving forward.\nIf the boys could learn from this complex situation that contributed to this hypocrisy, that would be good.\nWhen the adventurers finished their studies, Nathaniel sent the boys home early, leaving the boys relieved and relaxed, as the pain was too much for a visit. They expected this kind of pain in military training.\nOn day 7, Nathaniel used the time to reflect, while the boys addressed problems.\nAs for what these problems were and how they solved them, Billy returned home to his family, who were a bunch of loud creatures walking around their hovel and front like frogs hopping around. Notch was there to accompany Billy, and he greeted the family politely. Billy’s younger and older brother started a conversation with Notch about the tournaments. The rest of Billy’s family were carrying a bunch of crates full of a variety of items, chairs, and other wooden things. They placed these crates on a wagon, as they were headed to the market to sell. It was challenging carrying all these crates again and again almost everyday. But they had to. This was why the inside of the home was full of crates. It was hard to breathe, and they stayed outside on the front most of the time. When they slept, they did it on the floor of the hovel, having only a few pillows which the younger ones shared. Their only blanket was relatively expensive to them, so they all used it together. They had been accustomed to this lifestyle since they were born.\nBilly, his siblings, and his parents treated their house like sleeping quarters, but their home was truly on the streets where they breathed much better. If they wanted privacy, it would be out here around the area alongside around a hundred other children with similarly challenging lifestyles. In the distance, they saw large, pretty houses in gated neighborhoods, but they were stuck here in a small part of the district, only to stare. Rather than feeling jealous, they were ignorant of how much they lacked. Their zero formal education was one painful factor.\nIn the end, no one thought about being poor when that was their lives and all they knew. They were happy, as much as anyone was, because they were part of a community, making many friends of similar age and those 10 years older than them. Since everyone was very huddled together in terms of how they handled anything, they could find their slice of life and daily work somehow. But this was an ideal perspective of charitable wealthy individuals.\nThe issues were prevalent. For a bonus more comprehensive overview, fifteen issues could be identified.\nOne, those with high income lived relatively close in gated neighborhoods, which indicated a coexistence of inequality and income disparity. As a consequence of high costs of living in an highly urbanized city, those from low-income backgrounds were born and lived in slums.\nTwo, politically, the city dealt corruption, poor governance, and a lack of social safety nets, as adventurers and mages often dealt with concerns that could shake the city economy.\nThree, as mentioned earlier, discrimination, gender inequality, and social exclusion was very prevalent and openly practiced.\nFour, lack of access to clean water and sanitation was also an issue, despite the fact that magic was supposed to solve these issues already.\nFive, ironically, flooding was typical, as heavy rainfall was normal during the rainy season from May to October. Though, this rainfall was quieter, lacking strong winds and rough seas. Additionally, tropical cyclones took around 10 to 30% share in annual rainfall. Also, proper drainage systems were also lacking in many local areas, and development occurred in places exposed to flood hazards.\nSix, health issues such as poor nutrition and higher rates of diseases such as tuberculosis, stroke, and tropical diseases.\nSeven, stroke was a concern because of the tropical sun during its hottest days, but the government fortunately were making strides in dealing with this.\nEight, resource depletion was common as well, since magic sped up mining.\nNine, the issue with labor was that workers lacked job security, benefits, and fair wages.\nTen, as for crime, it was relatively low. Families in gated communities only experienced stealing a few times. If they did experience more times than that, it was due to a mistake on their part of forgetting and leaving their valuables. Since the communites were gated and secure, trespassing was very rare.\nEleven, public transportation included certain mages to cast faster walking magic as a job.\nTwelve, other issues include hunger and local and national poverty.\nThirteen, times of war, invasion, or civil unrest made rulers that much more corrupt to fund their military campaigns.\nFourteen, merchant and traders engaged in corrupt practices, such as false measures, adulterating goods, or engaging in price-fixing.\nFifteen, corruption and poor governance including the accepting of bribes, tax evasion, nepotism, buying and selling of offices, favoritism, and embezzlement of government money.\nFortunately, magic helped research and often fueled science, so people were becoming more aware.\nIn summary, the city sucked, but hopefully science and magic does something good.\nNonetheless, wealthy people often coveted living in this district where Billy, Shadrach, and Notch lived for other reasons that, to them, were “not rich” when others were clearly so much richer. They struggled to get out of bed in the morning to go school. Cleaning up and taking care of their body was a part of their daily morning routine. They tried to dress neatly and took care of their looks; though, they often said that they looked horrible. They were anxious and depressed about the future and wished they could live freely. To express their anxiety, they engaged in the arts and studied. They were human too, but their concerns were like a spit at the face of those below them.\nMoving forward, the next day, on day 8, Billy was struggling to fix his new clothes, as his parents pestered him into wearing it for the mining. Notch was helping him put with his clothes, intervening every so often, whenever he saw that Billy reached a deadend. Meanwhile, Millie and Shadrach stood around, rubbing their arms absentmindedly and such. It was morning again, and they felt the heat, sauntering under a shade. If it was anyone else from a colder area, they would ran under a shade as soon as possible. Regarding Billy’s parents, they had little recollection of the mines, as they worked as market vendors as children of vendors. Their lack of mobility as a result of no formal education contributed signifcantly to this heriditary job thing.\nThe subgroup within the boy group began walking one by one when their leader called them.\nTheir steps were like a sheep’s, and their leader was like a shepherd.\nThe moment stilled, for each of them to breathe in the dry air.\n“Hello, everyone,” their leader said.\n“Okay, okay, now what do we do?” said one of the boys.\n“We’ll be heading to the mines again. This time, you’ll have a companion: Goldberg. I won’t be present. I can’t be. My back is aching. I literally got himself injured more than a person like me can bear. So thank you, Mr. Goldberg.”\nFrom behind their leader, Goldberg stepped forward, his steel expresion like a god of war, his clothes shining in the light. He wore armor and wielded a weapon.\nHe was a warrior.\nThe boys were confused, some of them saying, “I thought the adventurers were a problem—”\nTheir leader interrupted them: “This one is not a friend of mine. He’s not anyone that I know. So I want you guys to think that this guy is just some guy.”\nThe boys were silent.\nGoldberg’s whole body was bigger than theirs, like a statue. Internally, the boys were like tiny clay figures, screaming and grasping for straws.\nOutwardly, the boys ignored him and moved on because their leader was expecting results.\nGoldberg accompanied them like a guide, his hands waving form side to side. He was always prepared to address a conflict between the boys, but the problem was that he had little knowledge about the group’s dynamics. So he often came across as a jerk. This disappointed the boys.\nAfter four of Goldberg’s confrontations, a communication party of Billy and three other boys, distinct from Notch and Shadrach, engaged with Goldberg, surpising the rest of the boys.\nGoldberg started to understand the group dynamics a little better through the communication party. So with this in mind, he decided to observe rather than calling out every time he perceived conflict. This was new. Instead of understanding the dynamics through trial and error in an aggravating way, he listened. This was much more peaceful and a testament to the growth of this party as a detachment serving a distinct and essential role within the larger group.\nAs a result, the boys and Goldberg felt relieved and relaxed, retaining more energy.\nWhen Goldberg noticed this, he gossiped about an incident where a person pranked soldiers with a fake wand but ended up getting shot at and killed. His tone had initial faint well-hidden contempt toward the person, but he was gauging the boys’ reaction to match them before he decided to go full force into either contempt, pity, or indifference toward the person.\nThe boys were shocked, but this was with interest and curiosity rather than disapproval or approval. To them, it was finding out a hidden layer of a world they were so curious about. Rather than wanting riches, the boys had a desire for knowledge, experience, and confidence, which was why they wanted to mature faster. If wealth made it so that they could become their ideal selves, which might mean protecting their current lifestyle, they would seize it.\nSimilarly, Goldberg was more than just a man with resources. He would seize the throne that certain people he knew dared sit on. No, no, they deserved to be punished for their arrogance. They humiliated him when they mocked him and treated him like a stranger. He would squash them all.\nTheir mockeries should be turned into nothing.\nHe was finally in his arc.\nHe would drag them all down to hell.\nHe would not sit down and watch. He would destroy them again and again and again and again.\nBut these were just feelings. He was a good man with a family, living patiently for over four decades and working as an adventurer for several years. He had to hold it in. He had an urge to kill—the humiliation twisting his insides. He could shake with rage and grief.\nAs for why he felt this way, he had an impending sense of doom, his entire life, memories, friends, families, and experiences being reduced to nothing and the evil men getting away with it. He was treated like nothing. He was nothing, which was why he was everything.\nHe would become everything.\nChapter 10 - The Depths of Conviction link“Hahahahahahahaha,” Goldberg cackled to a joke one of the boys made, smiling genuinely, clapping alongside them. Despite his peaceful demeanor and gait, his heart burned, crackling, popping, hissing, roaring, sizzling, whistling, creaking, crunching, rumbling, echoing, cackling, whispering, crashing, screaming.\nOnce, in the past, he said privately: “How dare they? How dare they? How dare they destroy who I am and burn everything to the ground—my innocence, my pride, my humanity—all gone!” (He had past trauma.)\nNow, in the present, nonetheless, the boys and Goldberg reached the mines.\nThe mines were large and terrifying, but any more thought of detail would be excessive to them. Right now, they were worried about living and dying, so they paid full attention to their actions as individuals, as part of a cohesive group, and as part of a transactional relationship of the adventurer Goldberg as a hired guard of the boys.\nHis managed rage would be essential to their victory, even if it sounded scary. The lip-biting kind was potent for non-strategic, straight-to-the-face combat.\nA spider leapt out, but instead of provoking Goldberg with satisfaction, it was a tiny one, making it only dangerous if it was venemous and within range. So, he cast healing magic on himself and slashed the spider down. This was cheap, as his healing magic dealt with venom easily. But this was level of magic was hard to obtain. It required decades of training, but the boys were more concerned with living right now than pondering history.\nWhen Goldberg used light magic that he spent decades training, the darkness disappeared. Incidentally, Richard, one of the boys who began to prefer it, felt at a loss.\nAnyway, the nearest group of people were running around in a part of the cave far from Goldberg’s group. They were carrying chests and throwing them into two crates. They would carry the crates onto a wagon one by one. Significantly, they were happy to put the effort in now for the satisfaction of sitting and travelling later with a job well done. Finally, only one of them was formally a miner, as the rest were just his friends, including one of his siblings. They were only here for a short task, and they had many other concerns to attend to.\nTheir small lives were more exciting than this crate-carrying quest. They had more to see, more to be, and more to express. If anyone dared treat them as insignificant directly, they would re-establish their humanity one way or another.\nAt one of many initial junctions in the mines, Goldberg just wanted to finish the job when he saw that the boys were just accustoming themselves to the place. This meant they looked like sitting ducks staring at a bunch of magical tools for days and days, only to craft some simple tool as a first project. This was boring.\nSo, after 11 or so hours, the boys just walked outside together as a way to say they were done. Goldberg looked like a deflated platypus by the time he saw them waving goodbye at him. He got up inside the cave from a rock seating and trudged outside, joining the boys with a sense of foreboding. If he did this again, he would rather read books while doing it. But that was what his sister did. So he thought that he should do it too.\nThe next day, on day 9, he tried it, reading books.\nMeanwhile, Billy was on one side, flirting with one of the women with a group of boys in the distance cheering for him. The woman was a cheery kind of girl, and he was up for the task of obtaining such a personality. So he would first flirt with the girl and then assimilate her personality into himself. This was the natural course of learning and communication. He was doing the flirting thing as a semi-joke. Somehow, Notch also was flirting with someone else, but it was a boy. Though, he might be just joking. As for Millie, she was too busy groaning about lying down since walking around was much more exhausting than fighting monster in the night. Simultaneously, she was busy observing some rocks and listening behind Shadrach. When it came to Shadrach, he was in a group analyzing rocks, writing down notes, continuing the task after the boy group’s leader asked him to do it once. It was his thing now, but he had a tendency for interfacing people anyway. So maybe this was a natural progression of his.\nThe output of their visits to the mines was negligible, but each visit revealed to them the interconnected structure of various rocks and how they combined to form the network of caves. It was small progress compared to skilled miners, but it would do for now.\nIf they wanted to get some further progress, they could incorporate battle training and try to make it more balanced this way.\nAfter the boys tried a few combat moves, Goldberg was quick to correct them, feeling bored that the books he brought were doing nothing to him.\nGoldberg was proving to be an asset to the group, and the leader of the boy group, separate from the effective mentor Goldberg, knew that. Though, this leader was taking a risk as usual. What a risky leader who knows relatively little about the technology of adventurers. He often just relied on his ability to assimulate people’s understanding by just talking to them. He could recognize the nuances and meanings behind their superficially simple words. This meant that he could infer context easily, so even if he knew little, he could know much.\nIn the background, the leader was making decisions and interacting with the complex society and market, which rippled down through the market vendor parents of Billy. This was part of the co-existence of various community structures and how they collaborate, even implicitly, to make sense of things.\nThe adventurer population were significant players, and their decision to collectively visit the district of Billy, Shadrach, and Notch four days ago meant shaking up the city. Some people were in the process of moving to the district some of the adventurers who stayed. This happened for many reasons, including marriage, friendship, some other connection, or because the adventurers’ visit was the straw that broke the camel’s back when it came to a decision to move to this district.\nWith peoples’ attention on the district during this time, information outlets paid more attention, noticing the more beautiful and awesome parts. The fact that the adventurers praised the district was a significant contributor to this. So that was another big reason for the move.\nHearing the district’s name again and again and only hearing great things were probably enough for many people to want to visit the district at least. The fact that terrifying new of goblins were circulating contrasted this added to this again. Fortunately, it was clarified that the goblin attack was everywhere rather than central to the district where it last occurred to people’s knowledge.\nDespite how little people died to goblins anually in comparison to how many goblins died, they were still considered terrifying.\nBut official outlets often circulated that adventurers were the heroes that vanquished the threat that monsters imposed. So that also meant emphasizing this threat.\nThis historical memory would make the children run in terror and throw rocks at goblins, even if it was their first time seeing them.\nIt was only righteous that the goblins destroy the divisions where their own were systematically and formally imprisoned and dying. They should take back their home, even if it meant wasting hundreds of indoctrinated privileged civilians in their wake to avenge and save millions.\nBut they were patient and still in great debate regarding how best to solve this issue. Yet, those who had zero formal education and experience in persuasive language wanted to use the physical body via which they labored to communicate their suffering. This meant violence. In the end, the goblins were trying.\nThose who had “formal” education got it through studying the notes made through studying human labor. The incident where goblins intruded into the mining operation of the leader of the boy group five days ago helped them obtain bits of useful knowledge. This was sadly little, relative to the accumulated knowledge and education of the humans.\nIf they could be as well-informed and knowledgeable like the humans, maybe they could promote discourse between goblins and humans. This could mean gaining humans’ respect and minimizing negative perceptions of goblins. Then, goblins could finally be “human” again.\nIf humans saw this, they would be disgusted.\nThey would hate the idea of equality and empathizing with “devils”. They would hate love, because their love was based on stratification.\nToday, they were free to do whatever they wanted, even if it meant proclaiming that they were not.\nThey would say anything instead of doing anything because as they did say, they could do nothing.\nHeroism was too yummy.\nIn actuality, the goblins were horrifying monsters. Their humanity was merely just a superficial pretense, and any humanity was a falsehood. They couldn’t be human, and they couldn’t seek out humanity as a human would. They could only be a nondescript enemy on the battlefield.\nThey were a hive mind like sheep.\nToday, they were human. Tomorrow, they were dead.\nWho cared about humanity nor goblins nor bearers of good will nor those who demand love from their fathers and mothers nor those who seek out hope in the darkness nor those who hate that they cannot find evidence for an idea that would be so beautiful if true nor those who keep on trying and struggle?\nIn the end, we were nothing.\nHearing that statement, the next day, elsewhere, Goldberg felt enraged, aligning with the other adventurers in the night.\nIn front of him, over a hundred monsters gathered, each showing distinction like rocks on a shoreline.\n“I am not nothing!” he said.\nHe would become everything.\nIn an isolated part of the forest, he was fighting zombies, skeletons, and other beasts, restoring himself.\nSeveral skeletons came from the west. He slashed them and kicked them with force, his feet like stamps.\nHe gloried in the violence, tearing out the skeletons’ heads, taking them as trophies before tossing them away. “Nothing!”\nHe killed several goblins by slicing them transversely, cutting them again and again until he was satisfied.\nHe demanded proof from these monsters. “Where is your humanity, huh? You have no conviction!”\nHe kicked and grabbed them. Several zombies leapt, avoiding his slashes, biting him aggressively.\nHe screamed and fell to the ground, hearing a zombie explode with purple particles.\nThis came from one of several adventurers nearby who came to help.\n“You are nothing…” Referring to the monsters, Goldberg murmured as his life faded.\nThe adventurers halted his process of death, saving him.\n“I deserve to live,” he said the next day jokingly in response to another joke. This was on day 10.\nTwo of the adventurers who saved him went out for a drink with him, making him guffaw several times over.\nIt was still early morning around 4 AM, so he still had time to spare and sleep before he came to work.\nBut, as with all fathers, family came first.\nBut his fist was hardened. His family, his children, were more than just reproductions of himself and his wife, their mother. They were his eyes.\nThis was why even now, feeling blinded by rage, he could see.\nAnyone that removed his eyes would be cast into a fiery hell.\nWhen he saw his children, he saw the sky, the earth, the clouds, and its inhabitants. He saw the great love of God and the hosts He commanded. He saw love imbuing love imbuing love. It was ten thousands of histories imbued into these children. They were great people.\nHe hugged them and said sweet small words, his eyes becoming wet.\nThe children asked him why, but he shook his head and said that he just thought they looked funny in a joking manner.\nThe children pretended to be angry, playing along. They knew him, his ways, and his jokes, so each joke he made was one of many reminders that he was still there.\nWhen the children and father moved on, the mother was staring through the window, seeing ghosts. She was a witch, but she was hiding this for 15 years now. This shameful thing was one of the reasons she was who he was now. As for whether a witch was truly bad, they just used normal magic historically associated with something bad.\nThe father’s life was that of risk-taking, even if he lived a relatively normal life as a family man. So, the protectively private nature of the hidden witch, his wife, balanced this. She handled the confrontations of her husband’s occupational peers, adventurers, skillfully and precisely with an aggressive hold on their information. With this control, she could manage how information flows and hide her identity better. By a combination of this and good luck, this made her husband get the guard job with an industry leader, specifically the leader of a particular boy group. Basically, she was that person who coordinated people and got people forming associations, being a central source of information.\nSpecifically, despite being not formally addressed as such partly due to being a woman, she was the reason why her church organization was able to secure funding. She did this by making sure the events of the church with adventurers went smoothly. This was done through two ways. One, her directions and charisma related to increasing participants through her well-established network like a trimmed and maintained garden. Two, she managed the ebbs and flows of participants at the events. These events involved getting people believing, working together with church-affiliated adventurers, and becoming ones finally. This increased the church’s capacity to send out help to various locations and effectively cull poverty. But this process involved a lot of consideration and blind spots. Adventurers were also only one of the populations involved in ensuring the simplicity of this process. More perspectives from a diverse set of peoples meant more accessibility in their respective communities.\nEither way, she was just a woman.\nIt was people more concerned with ego and making sure that “‘already working, don’t break it’ traditions and values” were not wasted that challenged her from within her peer group.\nShe was part of the group that wanted technology and magic to advance, but she recognized that whoever spearheaded this movement set the laws for what happened next. This was why her existence as “just a woman” was necessary. She lived based on necessity, and it was why was willing to abandon her ego, pride, or self, her witch identity and the recognition of her great work as an individual, for the greater good and acceptance of her people.\nHer husband, Goldberg, would never abandon his ego forever. It would always be at the tip of his tongue, waiting to constrict his next opponent, whomever they might be. He would call his wife, Priscilla, a coward, if he knew that she had abandoned herself because he loved her self. He would destroy everything about the adventurer groups, because one, he had a personal vendetta against certain people whom he held accountable as individuals there and because two, he hated the idea that a human being, such as Priscilla, should give up their humanity (individuality) for anything.\nTheir children were intelligent children who studied at home instead of taking formal schooling, emphasizing uniqueness over structure. Even though Goldberg loved this, Priscilla agreed to this for another main reason. She had past trauma with formal schooling when a guy got too reckless since he believed that forcefulness and assertiveness meant having bad social skills and therefore accidentally confrontational and aggressive. Though, this only became traumatic because she was already being pushed to excel as a woman. Her mother expected her to excel when Priscilla showed much more skill and indepedence than her brothers at many extremely challenging activities. This included learning multiple instruments, painting and drawing, writing fiction and technical writing, dancing, and singing, among others. This was more than just getting the word “Done” on each activity. She was a very obedient, motivated, and dedicated child growing up, and she could spent the whole day everyday learning. Her experience was also the reason for homeschooling, since she went through it herself. Her mother effectively expected her to be symbol for women, and Priscilla accepted this and her mother’s guidance in her growth, which was why she went through with homeschooling despite her trauma. Because of this acceptance, she held full blame on the aforementioned guy instead for her trauma.\nIn the end, Priscilla was indeed just a regular woman, and her husband balanced this by being the most egoistic piece of crap any one ever was. And that was a great thing. She wanted to be in the background of someone more shining anyway, emphasizing the role of the just-a-woman.\nAfter falling asleep and waking up hours later, Goldberg was walking, greeting others and confronting several different younger adventurers who still had the sneaky, finger-twirling look in their eye. He hated dishonesty and a lack of integrity among his peers, perceiving them as a slight against him. If Priscilla told him that she was a witch, anyone that quietly badmouthed witches would get a confrontation from him, even if he was supposed to hide it.\nHis ego demanded being blatant.\nChapter 11 - The Burden of Dreams and the Cruelty of Reality linkAt the mines, where Goldberg arrived, Billy was taking off his clothes, feeling that his shirt was too hot. His shorts were still on, but he needed to get a breather. He was too tired of trying too hard to think about whether people cared or not. He was a kid who just wanted to rest and take a break. Every time he had to think about rocks, money, and people, he already felt exhausted. So he sat down and just relaxed his shoulders, closing his eyes and taking a deep breath: a perfect moment for him.\nWith that said, Goldberg greeted and conversed with him anyway and the rest of the boy group. Later, he found some camaraderie, as he added that he should train them in battle. Overall, he was outstandingly professional when it came to his current task. This task only formally required him to protect these kids who were supposed to be miners or apprentice miners.\nMeanwhile, Billy imagined himself as a man of cool things with riches and stuff. This man was fat and had rings on his hand. He had a top hat and armor with cool clothes. He had a round body shape, and his legs were tiny. He wanted to be this cool. thousand giants So he grabbed some rocks and combined them together, imagining himself as this cool guy.\nA blast of magic flew from this rock, hitting the wall.\nHis silly childish imagination made it.\nAstounded, Goldberg saw the rules and logic falling to the ground, as the emotions and childishness of a boy dared to create beauty.\nThe magic was still busy showcasing awesome power, colors floating around. Wheee!\nBilly tried to do it again, and all the other boys did the same thing, following his simple advice: “See mind be!”\nThey all blasted magic from the rocks, and Goldberg recognized this—it was magic, not just any childish technique, but the formal kind.\nThey learned how to cast magic while in this isolated place for several days. And they did it without studying theory.\nBefore Billy was able to cast magic again, Goldberg stopped him when he remembered an adventurer exploding after casting too much magic in a desperate situation.\nHe and Millie, a monster hunter and one of the several women part of the boy group, followed protocol by stopping the boys. Before they potentially died, the magic ended.\nIn the end, the childishness was necessary. But Goldberg and Millie saved them because of the formal protocals they registered to memory.\n“Good job guys,” Goldberg said, resolving their fears.\nEveryone was laughing, Goldberg too.\nThe day was finally over, tears were shed, and the song of love and hope never died.\nIn the night, Goldberg stood beside his children.\nInternally, he saw himself in a mirror, and he recognized that he was a human. But he also saw goblins, monsters, people, the boys, Millie, his wife, and his children. He saw that he was incapable of fully capturing them to memory, but he could at least try. Today, their lives would be meaningful. Today, their lives would mean something against the stupidity of this fictional world. He was ignorant whether this world was just some kid’s imagination, but if it was, he would just laugh at himself because it would not change a damn thing.\nIn reality, the kids’ voices pierced through the air, clasping the textures of the lines of the walls and door frame. They were but members of the world that was their home.\nHe was still far away from murder and destruction, but he would guarantee them.\nTomorrow, he would kill a man, put a sword against his head, and pull the trigger, and then, he was dead.\nThis man was himself, shedding each individual skin of himself until he became the epitome of grace and beauty.\nThe children, his own and members of the boy group, could only savor their existences so much before he inevitably clashed with theirs to the point of bringing them far away into a place of peace and hope and a sense of devastation of past suffering.\nHe would not become someone’s plaything.\nThe next day, on day 11, he presented himself before the adventurer guild, holding his upside-down sword, the tip of it on the ground, his hands clasping the top of the handle, standing with legs apart in an established manner.\nHe was the lord of hosts, and he would strike down his opposition.\nThey expected him to go along with work as usual, grabbing tickets or requests and going along with that order. Then, he would say goodbye politely to the person at the counter and maybe bicker with some youngins there hiding at the corner. He was just some guy.\nSome guy? Some guy!\nHe was the everything! Not just some guy!\nHe grabbed the ticket and politely said thank you before leaving simply.\nHe realized that the desire to be kind was ingrained into him.\nNo, he was not nice. He was a monster.\nHe had to be a destroyer or something.\nHe had to remove this world’s nature of tying him, protecting him, and removing him from the equation.\nHe would put him somewhere that made sense.\nHe ran to the caves, hoping to find some overpowered magic that enabled him to destroy everything. The wish of stumbling upon an old wizard that taught and granted him spells of untold power. The wish of staring at the night sky and receiving a blessing from God with a note attached that said: “You shall become everything. Goodbye.” He was that aggressively hopeful.\nWhen he saw that the world was chaotic, he relied on the order of waking up, following the same routine, going to work,and finishing his job for the day. He said that today could be great if he decided to vanquish everything.\nWhy should he obey social order?\nHe wanted to destroy the sense of helplessness he felt.\nBut he felt this and kept going anyway. For decades, he did this and just kissed, embraced, and make love with this helplessness like a loving spouse. Why must he dare allow himself to be this way!\nHe grabbed a sword and attempted to do something with it. But the scabbard was still on. People were not threatened. They shouldn’t be. That wasn’t the point. People shouldn’t necessarily fear him. Instead, he wanted to be loved for who he was and still be normal.\nThis normal required that he finally get rid of the evil order. But any criminal act would be against his beliefs either. He could stare upon nothing and wait for it to move.\nHe was nothing.\nHe needed to break free while avoiding becoming a monster in the traditional folk tale sense.\nHe decided that he should kill in order to declare that he was a human being and not just a slave to the established way of things. He remembered the goblins and ran.\nThe goblins would provide him with an alternate route, and if he could control them. Then, maybe he could control his destiny.\nHe abandoned his job as a guard of the boy group, marking his first divergence from social order.\nWhen he sought and he found a goblin, it greeted him. After a period of silence where they gauged each other’s reactions, it handed him a bag and a request. This was analogous to the tickets or requests at the adventurer guild.\nThe request was to kill 5 rabbits, but here it meant that if he could kill 5 rabbits, he could kill 10. If he killed 10, it meant 50 dead. If 50, then 100 dead. If 100, then a human.\nAs time ticked and his manic rage upon the bodies of rabbits moved, so did his conviction that this was wrong intensified.\nRight before he killed a human, he stopped and attacked the goblin instead, tearing it apart with his sword.\nThis was just as bad, if not worse. Yet it was socially acceptable.\nHe took out his helplessness in a “healthy” manner.\n“Noooooooooooo!” Goldberg saw that he could never destroy the society that birthed him.\nHis wife and children only linked him to it.\nGrieving, Goldberg felt like he was giving birth to Suffering through his actions, and then, he saw that the only thing a man must do was become everything.\nSo, he kept walking, repeating the same line of thought and reaching the same conclusion. He convinced each time that he was about to do it, only to fail at the end, only to convince himself again that he was going to do it this time (next time).\nIt was this cycle that defined him, rather than the hypothetical result of this supposed progression of thought.\nHe would push the rock up the hill.\nSimilarly, elsewhere, outside of the mines, Billy was pushing a literal rock down a hill, as he was finally broken free from the chamber. Now, behind him, Notch and Shadrach, along with Millie and the rest of the boys. Today, they would be battling the walk back home.\nBilly’s rock was playful, and it was kindhearted like a witch who only cared about others. Through playing, Billy expressed himself.\nGrand dreams sprouted in the distance, and he only needed to adjust his lens to see them. He was already on the way.\n“A sword and a knife. Where is Goldberg?”\nThey saw a sword and a knife on the ground, but things happened based on order, at least according to people’s understanding of the world. All people made up each slice of a pie, and each slice presented with a distinct rare set of events. This sword and knife was one of those rare events.\nBehind them, like the beasts that killed Maverick, the reason for this sword and knife emerged. This stood with its feet addressing the earth, its mane like a beating collapse of a building. Every time it stumbled, it raged upon the earth, collecting dust and shoving each momentary doubt out of its mind in constant motion. It was a monster, mechanistic, unlikely to feel without a predetermined path toward violence, similar to people.\nAs mentioned earlier, the boy group’s guard, Goldberg, was gone.\nConsequently, the boys were already meeting an entity outside their arranged paths.\n“A troll!” some of the boys said.\nThe troll ran at a high speed with a top of over 100 miles per hour. It grabbed the boys and crushed them.\nTheir blood and flesh flew in the air, meeting silence, meeting God.\nThe boys were right. They were helpless.\nThe troll killed 80% of them before it recognized that it was having too much for food. So it just let the rest leave.\nThe boys were alive, but they were no more. Their potential was cut short, and they were just about to burst into flame like juvenile eagles on the cusp of a grand adventure.\nMillie slashed and crushed the troll’s arm, reducing herself to a flying mess of colors. Her body lay next to Billy. He screamed.\nMillie was gone, and her body was next to him, lying down softly like a spouse in the middle of the night still longing for some kisses. She was a beautiful woman, and her life was cut short. But if it wasn’t beauty that killed or prevented her from dying, then did beauty matter in the first place?\nBilly flailed his arms, the troll’s shadow meeting him.\nChapter 12 - The Aftermath: Bonds, Dreams, and Consequences linkShadrach was there, writing down notes of the event.\nNotch was still busy considering whether he should go to the park or go home.\nNo one was there, as mentioned earlier.\nThey were still back at home or at the mines or heading from the mines. They were hapless.\nOne boy laughed, still thinking about the joke one of the his late friends made.\nTheir friendships were secure in their heads, but tomorrow, they would wake up.\nThe notes that Shadrach made were useful, but that was it.\nTomorrow, this event would be shared like fresh doves in the morning sun, quietly beckoning the flute of horror and normalcy.\nIf the pain of leaving them by abandoning his job of protecting them to pursue growth was worth it, Goldberg asked the city to let him know.\nHe was shaking. They would be heroes he said. He would become…\nHe killed several goblins, becoming a bane.\nHe kissed the troll alongside over a hundred other adventurers, all set on avenging the boys despite their lower status.\nThe troll was lying like a shark out of water, tortured, but it was free to feel.\nA days after the incident, on day 12, Goldberg and many others would join the discrimination against goblins and their monster kind, because a monster killed his friends.\nBut, internally, Goldberg automatically blamed this troll rather than entire monster kind, including goblins. He was just impulsive and emotional when he killed the goblins, considering that his society promoted monster hunting, especially in the night.\nThe boys were alive, and they didn’t die because they were alive. They were surely alive, and every time, they were alive. They lived.\nThey didn’t die. They lived.\nThey were living.\nGoldberg met them. He counted them and saw about 60, but he wasn’t that good at counting anyway. So who cared?\nHe met the boys, and they looked sad. So he made a joke. They got angry, but he was just saying hi.\nHe didn’t know how to talk to them, and he knew that the boys were dead. But he didn’t know how to talk to those who survived.\nIn reality, he was talking to Shadrach and Notch. Billy was dead inside.\nSince the boys suffered long enough, it was good that they got rewards.\nThe boys realized if they could die at any time, they should experiment with Goldberg regarding magic. So abandoning mining, they decided to blast magic everywhere.\nThey decided to blast everywhere.\nThe magic flew with sparks.\nGoldberg kept helping them and aligning them.\nThe boys were so smart that they were able to shoot several rocks.\nGoldberg encouraged them, even if this was not his joke anymore.\nToday, he was helping a bunch of traumatized kids hope and believe in their dreams. This meant that he would be there when they recognized that achieving their dreams often meant sacrificing themselves in the process.\nSo he would be there for them.\nThe boys were sure they would make it. They had the guts to try at least.\nThey saw people in fairy tails go through shit and still survive. It was likely that they would win too because they were that awesome.\nThey were cool, or whatever word made them feel better.\nThey were everything.\nGoldberg smiled.\nThe boys stared at the walls, seeing that the magic they did barely did any damage to the cave.\nToday, their dreams would come true.\nAn explosion erupted from the walls, where several goblins arrived, staring at Goldberg who killed one of their messengers. These goblins were Marchacha goblins, and they were here to arrest and reprimand him.\nThis was an opportunity for the boys, since the goblins wanted information and the boys wanted power. Their collaboration would be sweet.\nThe boys entertained the goblins, pushing Goldberg who let them do it with all the guilt he held in his heart already. Instead of being like this forever, he walked forward and showed that he was willing to let his life end if it meant that he could be honest for once.\nThis was his agency and moral integrity.\nHe won, as the goblins chained him up and moved him aside.\nPriscilla, his wife, and Nash and Leia, his children, were going to have to adjust to new life circumstances.\nHis loud mouth was finally gone.\nEven if the boys had dreams, they were still nervous around goblins, so the goblins gave them space. To take advantage of this opportunity, they told the boys that if they wanted to have a practical conversation, the boys had to be strong enough to impact their district. They gestured at Goldberg as an example of someone with influence.\nThe taste of delicate movements of the tongue along with excessive saliva accompanied their fight-or-flight attempts to compose themselves and communicate before the ant-like goblins left.\nIt was too late, so they assessed their wins today to seize control.\nThey would win, and they would use others as stepping stones to get ahead, even the ruthless goblins.\nIn the background, the city experienced flowers, the taste of cooked meat and rice, the way the sun touched the horizon, the smell of food and drink, the movements of various citizens along the coastline, the moon’s ethereal rage upon the darkness, the faint and subtle variations of paint on murals, the lovely smiles of children getting gifts, the drowning flavor of being underwater in the sea, the cries of hope, the sounds of cloth obeying the wind, the conversations, calls of birds, and barks of dogs, the tapping of wooden tables, the sounds made when people adjusting their sitting, the steps across the rock, the dancing senses of the dividedly lit streets, the gracious lettering of shop signs, the robust wooden wagons as they bore weight, and the usefulness of every word spoken in turning the wheel of society around.\nWhen the boys won their battles, they would be part of the wheel.\nIn chaos, there was order.\nAnyway, “The fatal incident of the apprentice miner boys”, as the incident was referred to in information outlets, happened for a similar yet considerably distinct reason relative to the fatal incident with Maverick and his fellow laborers.\nWith a death rate of around 7 per 1,000 people annually and an approximate population of 10 million to 40 million, the country where these incidents had happened expected 70,000 to 280,000 deaths annually. This meant that these incidents, although terrifying and very sad, really were just rare ways to die, given the more common yet still predominant causes of death.\nSince adventurers were very impulsive and their contributions ranged widely due to how random dungeons were as a pillar of the economy, income and market were unstable, especially in businesses that catered to adventurers, and investors were uncertain. Since prices were fluctating, speculative investment increased, exacerbating price swings. This was why the government was investing more into mining operations even after the fatal incident of the apprentice miner boys. In fact, this incident boosted exposure of mining to the masses. This made the government’s transition toward promoting mining from adventuring natural. Moreover, the government was trying hard to implement regulation on adventurers, but this was proving to be a challenge. As for the reason of this, providing a safety net for adventurers was essential to make sure that the regulation didn’t end up becoming counterproductive. Understanding the impact of adventurers on the economy was also crucial, so research of this and forecasting was emphasized. As for the adventurers, the government encouraged them to save, get insurance for injuries, equipment damage, quest failure, and magical tool, treasure, and artifact loss during a quest, collaborate with investors in regard to profits from quests, and join guilds and associates, as a large proportion of them still tried to go “lone black knight”.\nIn the end, the villains were just people who thought they were special, but in reality, they were acting accordingly statistically.\nBasically, despite the chaotic nature of incidents and whatever, society maintained social order and even expected events statistically.\nMoreover, a fatal or traumatic incident, if one was involved, felt like society was collapsing, but the thing was, society went on and expected stuff like this to happen.\nBut people were addressing these issues, and one of them was Priscilla, the wife of the adventurer Goldberg, who was doing more than just being a symbol for women. In fact, it was because she was this symbol that she addressed broader but still devastating issues that ravaged the nation such as disease, poverty, and such.\nShe was doing more than just talking about them. In fact, she was so mad that she decided to go forth and destroy the enemy.\n“Now, I know some of us want to move on from this incident, but it’s not fair to those who lost their lives. It’s not fair to people. We cannot forget them. We must put our hearts forward. I know words just sound like dirt right now, but please trust me. Trust our adventurers. Trust the people to make the right choices as they consider who they’re electing for the next era of taking responsibility for issues that continue to destroy human lives. Goblins, disease, death, and malpractice seem to just destroy all of that. I don’t want that. Me and everyone here doesn’t want to continue this way. In regard to the incident, do we have to keep going like this? No. No. No.”\nThe adventurers agreed with her but hated the talking, demanding fellow adventurers to take action and boldly help the community, moving forward.\nTo address the issue, the adventurers decided to take a proposal to continue to build barriers in the wilderness, since the city spread laterally rather than vertically with the miners’ help. Though, Leroy, a mining operation leader, was disappointed that they withheld support for miners to focus on other issues.\nOn a related note, in one of the adventurer parties, a leader said to demoralized members: “I know you guys want to tear society down for letting this happen, but we have to just get this done. Now, it’s not going to happen again. It can’t—” He noticed that one member was grumbling, so he changed his approach. “Were their lives meaningless? No! They weren’t!” To conclude, he kept going, arming himself, preparing for a military confrontation with his members right alongside him.\nIn any case, regarding the barriers to be added, they were additions to existing barriers. This barrier building also addressed old barriers. This meant repairing and even addressing the need to demolish ones that misalign with new standards of effective beast and monster stopping.\nAs for where monsters came from, they spawned or appeared suddenly in the night time and often stayed alive in the shade of the day, but they burned in the sunlight. When it came to beasts, they lived similar to humans in having communities and being born. However, the troll was an exception among the monsters in the “monsters burns in the sunlight” rule or observation.\nIndeed, adventurers attacked monsters in the night, because they often accumulated outside the barriers and on roads, which created a definite risk for travelers.\nThis was why adventurers were a necessary force in a chaotic world that tended toward entropy, which included closed systems and open systems such as humans. To expand this, adventurers were one of various regulatory mechanisms used to maintain societal homeostatis: the joys of spring time, weather, and love without the mess.\nThey were cool.\nChapter 13 - The Child of Sunlight linkMoving forward, two days after the fatal incident of the apprentice miner boys, on day 13, in a smaller scene, a small child rode a wagon, tasting the heat. It was like every step of the sun required its great might to beat at the earth as a natural byproduct. This was sunlight and its joys.\nMaybe, the night wouldn’t be so bad, if the moon had a similar effect.\nThe child saw her little body and recognized that she could grow taller one day. This was how she connected the sunlight with growth, hers.\nLike a sword slashing the sun, the clouds and the wooden parts of the wagon blocked her sight, beause she was getting off, though with a slight disconnection with how much her environment demanded from her. Every step she made was a statement of her great power to change things. But she didn’t know that. She would one day recognize her great power.\nToday, she was striding. The night sky would demand that she close her eyes, as the morning would request that she assert herself. In these, she was complete.\nSurrounding her, a variety of bird sounds and the fresh ambience of the outside with its trees, vegetation, and leaves obeyed her wish to be calm.\nDespite the fatal incident, her family was safe. Even if many ends of the city had risk, adventurers gathered in many outer city locations where people could relax.\nThis was why she would grow to love adventuring. Internationally, countries often specialized in certain goods where they had an advantage. In this city, certain specialized adventurers were in plenty.\nThis was where she fitted in as a vital component of the essence of society. Regarding just one aspect of her humanity, her fire magic, she could cook food on the go, preserve food, and heat water for drinks, all of which helped regulate people’s temperature especially in the rainy season. (2) She could sanitize and remove waste more productively. (3) She could consider controlled fire to enrich soil and eliminate pests. To expand soil enrichment, this included making soil more free, giving them more air to breathe for roots and water, slaying bad pathogens, and making helpful microbes have a fun time. (4) She could join the manufacturing force, specifically processing clothes and wood products. (5) She could become a blacksmith, smelting extracted ores. (6) She could melt rocks or ores in mining and use her heat sense to navigate, as the earth was a noisily hot place. (7) She could smelt ores. (8) She could destroy debris, such as plant ones, through thermal stress, shock, and melting. (9) She could move air, which was a mixture of gases. (10) With some fire magic engine, she could power vehicles such as carriages, boats, and hovercrafts. Basically, she could do something similar to what steam engines did in the sense that intense heat equated to high-pressure steam, which went into an it’s-a-cylinder to push pistons. Then, the steam expanded and cooled, creating a vacuum to draw back the piston in an again-and-again process to power things that society needed or else. (11) She could be a surgeon or something similar, because burning wounds or cauterization was awesome. (12) She could be a heating and cool system in homes. (13) she could be an artist or an entertainer. (14) The words “incendiary” and “bombs” should be enough to recognize the potential of fire magic. If society knew the science behind electricity, they would be able to generate it through generators and fire magic.\nA human being was essential.\nTomorrow, she would live. The day after tomorrow, she would continue. Two days after tomorrow, she would present herself. Three days after tomorrow, she would grow. Four days after tomorrow, she would reflect on the moment. Five days after tomorrow, she would have done a good job.\nSurrounding her, what was 12 days ago when someone’s post-death legacy began was forever, ingrained into culture and historical memory, as if that was the case since the beginning of time. Now, the effect of this person’s fatal incident, the danger of beasts, became embedded into the minds of everyday people, from children to teenagers to adults.\nThroughout time, the “simple” things people went through were momentous because people’s lives were full of simple things, the details, science, and complexities being damned. In other words, life was simple because people perceived them to be so, yet these inherently complex simple things were momentous anyway despite this perception.\nIn reality, the child was all of these ideas in the flesh.\nAround the area urban-decorated due to the community structure involved, expressions varied. One, birds flew and tapped on various materials. Two, clouds left their spots and paused whenever someone stared. Three, light represented either hope or invalidation of someone’s negative feelings. Four, words floated by like lilies in a pond. Embracing through these, the child fleshed out herself by observing and interacting with people, albeit nervously.\nAfter talking with human beings rather than representations, she saw humanity.\nNext to the child, her father and mother appeared, but they were there the whole time. It was now that she recognized that she would find herself supported by parents that knew her potential.\nTo her father, a doctor, humanity was a “dog”, a clear, singular dog climbing to the sky via anatomical, physiological, and psychological attributes.\nTo her mother, humanity was striving, telling people all the time that things mattered when they didn’t, which was why she decided to focus on materials as a “geomancer”. Geomancers were more like geologists, but they studied enchanted gemstones, crystals, pearls, and magical minerals. Though, geomancers dabbled in materials science as well via magic solutions, even if they had little clue and theory as to what this world’s counterparts of atoms and molecules were. In this world, science, or what was just beginning, and magic was based on principles and methods—methodology—but not necessarily the scientific method, or the counterpart thereof. As they knew it, the only thing that mattered was trying one’s best.\nOn a more relevant note, contrasting the infancy of magic and science, adventurers were nearing the end of lawlessness, lack of structure, and the frontier spirit era. On a positive note, this lack of structure contributed to uniqueness and diversity. This was similar to the early years of things before they became pillars of their industries commanding standardization. These years had that feeling that everything was new and nothing was oversaturated or streamlined to the point of losing personality.\nThis loss of uniqueness was why some adventurers like Goldberg felt particularly frustrated to the point of abandoning their jobs. For a time, he could be himself somehow even within a society, but his occupation, adventuring, was already getting pressured by officials and public concern. The reputation was still good, but adventuring was being expected to change. One mining industry pillar even openly promoted a societal transition toward promoting new entrants into mining and other laborer communities rather than kowtowing to adventurers.\nThis accidentally resulted in the fatal incident of the apprentice miner boys when their hired guard, an adventurer, silently forwent going to work, as, unfortunately, a violent troll appeared, directly causing and ending the incident.\nTo complicate matters further, it’s not a direct cause, as the troll was not caused by the end of the “wild west” era of the adventurers. But the fact that the adventurer quit his job was essentially caused by the decline of uniqueness in the end of this era.\nThis was a crucial fit, closure, in the story.\nMeanwhile, despite the fatal incident involving his apprentice miners, the mining operation leader, Nathaniel, reconnected and reintegrated the boys and women who survived this traumatic incident. This meant departing from creating a separate labor detachment and instead inserting them into his main labor force. Though, this would be tricky, as they needed psychological adjustment following the trauma and had little experience. So, he would be stretching himself just to make sure that their unique perspectives were employed into his corporation.\nFor bonus context, corporations in this world were different from modern ones.\nTo start, nobles and governments allowed for corporations because it was very challenging to manage magic and its effect on empowerment with a double-edged sword, labor industries, organizations, and unions, among others. So this high level of intricate, compartmentalized structure allowed for magic to be managed across different roles and intentions to maximize economic efficiency and regulations, such as anti-bullying monopoly-breaking anti-trust laws, respectively. In short, corporations and organizations that had well-defined roles and responsibilities made it easier for governing bodies to establish regulations and specializations for each specific aspect of magic. Similarly, a guy could talk, but people were complex. This made talking complex. This made it so that people needed to go away from each other and find communities of the same interests to make talking easy. This was a simplified way to view magic.\nBut magic was just one big element of the equation. Yet, it was like the economy. It got complex because in real-world cases, it happened in every field.\nReturning to the story, the next day, on day 14, 12 boys and 2 women arrived in a wealthy gated neighborhood. Three of these boys already came here, but today, they were here to relax and discuss with their leader, Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair, under the guise of a trip to a pretty place.\nThe topic of dungeons was brought up in the form of several ideas.\nOne, dungeons were just around the corner, but they would have to stock up on resources and goods and strategical thinking. This required more than just resolve. It was a matter of intelligence.\nTwo, slowing down their aim, or relaxing before they expanded their firsthand experiences in combat, would help them recover their losses and energy. Moreover, it would help them process, assess, and reflect on what they had learned, giving themselves a summary in the process. This was key to productivity.\nThree, they needed to address the issues of the organization and effectively collect a list of tasks sorted by priority. Sinclair already made this happen, but it was a helpful addition.\nFour, Sinclair had certain demands regarding how best to dress and appear to make sure that they were uniform. He said that this was more than being superficial. This would serve as a reminder of their much needed resource—the approval of the tenured members of their corporation.\nFive, if the boys and women wanted to have it easier, they would have to finish close the gap between their knowledge and that of the tenured members. This required studying and learning under their guidance. They needed to be humble, so whatever pretense or ignorance they had before needed to be gone or, at least, not obvious. He mentioned a principle that a few words, humility, and calm go a long way into making someone appear wise.\nIn conclusion, Sinclair emphasized that these were 5 abstract objectives that required creativity and flexibility to enact effectively. “Know the rules before you ‘break’ them,” he said.\nSome of the boys asked what the objectives had to do with dungeons in a composed manner. Though, they felt tongue-in-cheek or disbelieving about Sinclair’s five ideas.\nIgnorant of this, Sinclair wore his glasses. “Everything.”\nTo summarize, this included preparation, reflecting, addressing issues by a sorted list, adhering to accepted standards even in small things like attire and appearance, attentive humility, flexibility, and creativity.\nHe continued, “If dungeons and mining were just playing pretend, everyone would be kings and queens by now.\n“One of the things people your age soon learn is that the world revolves around you. But it also revolves around itself with all its monstrosities, the needs of this ‘world’ being the needs of the people. We require much just to survive and thrive, so if you think you know what you want, realize that you only know that. What you need is so much greater in terms of what you need to do to achieve this. People will recognize one day that people struggle, and with that said, it’s enough to want to look for solutions. This way, we can prevent having to deal with the struggle of losing a friend or the people necessary for one’s enjoyment or existence. Those who cannot love themselves cannot love others. Recognize your worth, and then, you will recognize what people need. Your needs are what I’m exemplifying here.”\nCynical, a boy named “Nathan” stood up, about to leave, just barely listening, rubbing himself in discomfort. He and the rest of the boys and women were at the door or near there already. The smell of the rich house was bothering his nose, but it was also because of how Sinclair talked to him and the rest. He felt helpless when Sinclair was involved. Sinclair was basically the reason why they even were here in the first place. Why would he talk to them like that? As if they were immature? In the end, being a 16-year-old boy meant being hard to please, because the world was never going to match his needs completely since he changed, thereby changing the world’s needs. Recognizing this would make it easier to be happy.\nFortunately, the rest, however, were glad that they could finally get advice, even if it meant hearing someone talk systematically. He talked in line with how anything worked consistently—a system of methods, intertwining in many different ways. This was second nature to those who knew them.\nOverall, the boys only relied on things they learned informally, but it was this informal flexibility and creativity that made them more effective when implementing the solutions Sinclair proposed. However, they understood little about what he was saying formally. The last time he talked, he only gave directions, but now, he was cultivating independence in them.\nYet, the boy who was uncomfortable with Sinclair, Nathan, wanted to be independent from what Sinclair was. But in his case, he equated his cynicism toward Sinclair to being honest with addressing issues. He was justified by virtue of Sinclair’s contribution to his friends’ death. Namely, he was negligent of hiring only one guard instead of insuring with several replacements. When the punctual guard suddenly abandoned his job and a troll abruptly appeared, the friends that should have been under his protection lost their lives to this troll. The main issue was that his friends were apprentices under Sinclair’s care.\nChapter 14 - Dynamics of Compromise and Friction linkWhen in need of help, it was natural to obey and listen in order to receive aid. This was why the rest of the group approved Sinclair’s goals even after what he did to them and their friends.\nThis was a compromise, but it would do for now. Eating stale bad bread today with the hope of eating fried chicken tomorrow was better than nothing at all.\nTo add to this idea of compromising and less-than-ideal satisfaction in the territory of analytical philosophy, things, as they were when static, didn’t exist. Constant things didn’t exist. It was only when things accelerated or decelerated that they existed. Dynamic flow and the need to adjust one’s reality and methods of self-reference after assessing the current state after a series of chaotic fluctations and complex interactions was essential. Understanding that one’s life of constantly improving oneself was not a constant, but an element of a big dynamic world, was crucial. This went the same for the economy. Any value exchange or difference allowed definitions to exist between two values, giving each a definition. Simply, changes gave things definition. Constant things were merely abstract concepts that only gained definitions through change. This was a fundamental part of cognition and Galilean invariance, where the constancy of motion and no motion were indistinguishable, only gaining definition through acceleration and deceleration or change.\nAs for the boys and women, even before this conversation with Sinclair, they understood this concept of dynamism well via the complexity of the real world, yet their eloquence was limited and specialized elsewhere.\nBut they would cry if it became tough because they knew they had to.\nSo when Sinclair accompanied them outside, he saw them crying and wiping their tears, walking and showing camaraderie even now, even after they were the source of each other’s bane at one point. If he could help them, he would save them. He would create might and love for them, but he would have to be god on earth. So he moved forward.\nHe closed the door and returned to his home, where all his books were.\nHe opened the door to a brown room and opened several books, placing it on a desk. After reading page 157 of a book, he went to another book and continued where he left off. He was around to find a way to understand people.\nThe books were detailed accounts of people who came from poor backgrounds, and he was reading them to understand the culture, but specifically the psychology of these kids.\nHe would become much more capable if he could make the right decisions in most desperate times, so an underlying theory would help him achieve this, since he grew up in a wealthier setting.\nThis was his only way to make sure that their potential in mining and dungeoning was fostered manageably.\nAlso, he was fine-tuning his refined ability to utilize people better, so he was gaining a lot from this. Each update to his steady good state would mean extending his skill and knowledge increase since the last update. This was excellence.\nEarlier, during the quiet interludes between Sinclair’s ideas, the boy who was cynical of him, Nathan, asked him why he gave Notch extra money, even though his grievances lay elsewhere. Sinclair said he wanted to pander to his wishes for money, emphasizing that Notch addressed him directly and requested money from him as a semi-joke.\nNotch heard the conversation, but he was nervous and coping with grief.\nThe rest of the boys and women felt similarly.\nBilly was crying softly during the entire meeting.\nShadrach was lying down, his face twitching, tears dripping down, suppressing a frown.\nEven if Sinclair focused on delivering his ideas, he knew that the only thing he could do was watch them eye-to-eye.\nIn conclusion, returning to the present, he extended his frustration and anger by outsourcing an adventurer group, worried that he might waste the members of his community again.\nLater, at a spot outside an adventurer guild, staring at Sinclair, the leader of the adventurer group only wanted to hear him explain. But Sinclair was just giving short answers. He looked reserved about the whole process. But this was bad, so the leader kept asking open-ended questions, looking at Sinclair for any signs of communication. In the end, he gathered that they should do what Sinclair said first: “Kill 50 goblins, but bring one of my boys Shadrach. He’ll record the event.”\nSinclair knew that this was a dirty way to do it, and he was putting much trust in Shadrach. But today, he wanted to see if one of them was capable of leading the group. So he chose the one he thought was most keen to learn formally. This way, he could reward Shadrach with that much needed empowerment. As for the rest of the boys and women, he would let them grieve for now. This should help Shadrach make decisions better, because he had responsibility now.\nJust like how Shadrach had shown an inclination toward noting down things, Sinclair also made sure several individuals, rather than only one like before a fatal incident that left around 40 apprentice miners dead, was recording everything with the group he did for a resource. Through this resource, he could delegate the agenda of handling other groups in similar enduring milieu to one of his directors. This was crucial since he was the most proficient in terms of leading decision-making. This way, each laborer sub-set fell under several directors rather than only one, as any inclusion of street kids would require the directors’ familiarity with the centralized resource on the kids. Though, this multiple-director model, intended to fine-tune checks and balances, would require regular evaluations. In this case, checks and balances addressed concentration of power, but, more relevantly, reliability and accountability.\nAs for the connection of the incident to his changes, he used one individual to protect the apprentice miners. But when this individual with a high track record abandoned his task, the apprentices lost their lives in a sudden confrontation with a troll. This made him recognize that the one-individual model might need a break. So he decided to start thinking about how to include a multiple-individual model in recording and in the organization structure.\nThough, this contrasted his decision to involve only Shadrach as one person to record the events of the adventurer group he hired. Yet, he knew that giving the boys and women a break was crucial. He was not a purely rational person, so he recognized emotional struggles when he saw it. So having only Shadrach record was also a sign to Shadrach that he could stop and join the rest of his friends if he wanted.\nThe day after the boys and women’s meeting with Sinclair, on day 15, an adventurer saw himself in his shadow, sweat streaming down his nape and chin, the heat burning brightly. Next to him, several peers sat.\nIf he could bring down the government because they didn’t speak for them, he might be happy. But the bruises never healed.\nHe decided to cry.\nHis peers comforted him, but it was with unveiled anger similar to him.\nTomorrow, they would become supreme people like the marginalized adventurer that killed several civilians in retaliation. They thought that the government and society would never address their problems. Within adventurers, several issues were prevalent. One, competition was getting fierce. Two, entrants were finding zero footing. Three, many factions and monopolies with restrictive, mutually exclusive memberships that required a lifetime commitment were reaching their peak, leaving many marginalized. Four, the time of lawlessness was nearing its end, which also meant that structure was also refining these power structures. If the government decided against addressing these and continued to promote these adventurers, specifically the hegenomy, then the marginalized adventurers would find retribution through violence.\nThey laughed, seeing the joy in expressing their grief. If they could express this grief in full through their planned attacks tomorrow, they could finally be free to be themselves and still be normal. The marganlized would wake up and jolt the privileged out of their sockets and pillow cases. These privileged would love this earth with them.\nThe next day, on day 16, their hands were shaking, but they were ready.\nOne of these attacking adventurers shouted.\nA man stared at a dog before seeing his head on the ground. A end result of beheading through several different spells emerged from one of the attacking adventurers.\nMore men came out of their homes, thinking that the sounds they were hearing was wrong. But even with their magic, just one attack was enough to slay them.\nMore bodies fell, thudding against the ground.\nWith their movements on sprint, the adventurers said: “Tomorrow! You shall see the anguished fallen!\n“Love shall be heard at the rooftops!”\nMeanwhile, several older men were pushing up the heat-blocking covers of a store front to pass.\nThey looked around the street, seeing that it was quiet.\nWhen they saw that a group of adventurers were running, their eyes widened. These adventurers were distinct from the ones attacking, as they were part of the forces whom the status quo had benefitted. So they were reacting to preserve “tradition” and “culture” by removing any attempt at dismantling the system.\nThe older men cheered on these good young adventurers, whom one of them even helped get to the high rank that he was through communication.\nThe attacking adventurers only wasted 18 people with 57 injured from long-range attacks before other adventurers ended them.\nThis was their final fit, their final bellyache.\nAnyway, meanwhile, society would continue.\nSociety would press on.\nIt would forget the moments of this day.\nBut the monsters were out there. Adventurers just needed to go to war with them, and their problems would be solved. If they went to war, they would find happiness. War meant happiness.\nThe problem was that war existed everywhere and for many different reasons, connecting each element of society together.\nThe attacking adventurers found that their attack here addressed their issues that hunting monsters, laboring, and the idea of starting a family couldn’t distract them from forever.\nLater during the day, elsewhere, Sinclair found out that the adventurers he hired requested for a postponement for the job because one of them passed away. He knew about the attack, so he felt frustrated for the first time in a long while.\nHe said: “The hell is wrong with these pieces of crap! First, they invade my mine. Then, they start killing people! What the hell! Disgusting!”\nPersonally, Catherine Orlov Sinclair, his wife, was there to ask him about it. She rarely heard him angry, so she sat down and calmly talked to him, as if he was just complaining about the weather. This was her way of dealing with serious issues, effective, neat, dispassionate like the arrangement of items on a clothed table at which Sinclair and her sat.\nWhen it came to politics, she was a card-carrying individual who loved the power that corporations had against the government and unions had against corporations. To her, the government was too busy worrying about fixing remote roads and recording every single trivial action they made to the point of bureaucratic inertia. It was empowering people that she recognized as crucial.\nShe was the more broader mover of the couple, spending her time dealing with addressing larger implications rather than engaging with minute detail. She hated peripheral incidents and even mocked the government’s over-emphasis on addressing the rare, fatal incidents, because it was them who made it happen in the first place through systematic inaction. These incidents only covered a tiny portion of problems, and the truth was that this inaction was making so many more issues. Yet, because these issues misaligned with sensationalism, they were getting sidetracked. Every time the government started addressing them, eye-catching incidents popped up that interrupted this.\nHer solution and goals involved extending the government’s move of building barriers to address an incident. She knew that if another incident arose, they would leave the plan unfinished and re-focus again, which wasted funds. So she needed to make sure that they finished the job. In truth, it was better that the government focused on finishing the job, even if it took years. This way, skilled workers could emerge, because if the government kept switching and abandoning, it would be nigh impossible for workers to want to specialize. This was why adventurers were also getting so much attention, since they were being expected to handle every issue. In reality, it was impossible to multi-task every sector, need, or issue, and this created a concentration of power that wasn’t even effective. So many times, barriers were left unfinished with gaps, because specialty on this issue was absent. As for the reason of this, a subgroup within adventurers were the ones expected to deal with this. But a dedicated permanent specialty aside from this subgroup was necessary for long-term growth and reliability. Laborers like miners existed, but they were given little permanent improvement due to the government being so erratic.\nOf course, her solutions were idealistic, considering that the government itself was full of families and nobles with different agendas. She would have to establish a foothold in the government through connections in order to secure even a portion of her proposed solutions. But she knew that taking a public office would limit her power and force her to obey the wishes of the administration. This was why being the partner of a magnate was more meaningful than trying to take an office as a woman.\nBack to the moment, she told her husband, Sinclair: “It’s not like it’s not possible.” She was responding to Sinclair’s paraphrasing of his iterative discussion with a landed noble regarding fixing a colossal gate. It sounded like a waste of time, but the noble believed that Sinclair’s men could help him as part of a larger initiative.\nChapter 15 - The Noble’s Struggle: Yearning for Adventure linkTwo days later, on day 18 Sinclair greeted his miners at a gate, seeing a girl testing her fire magic at the side with her two parents. This was an isolated place now, since the gate was closed for a long time now.\nWhen Shadrach and the adventurer group he hired joined, Sinclair already had several individuals supervise the group. Adventurers had standards, but this time, he was paying extra care into making sure that they made the right overarching decisions.\nThis decision stretched Sinclair thin, so he only got half of his miners for this job, since these particular ones got performance-based pay. This was because he had to deal with frequent changes in schedule recently. Basically, he employed a mix of fixed-rate and performance-based pay to maximize flexibility.\nThis was good for the miners he brought, since they were working in an unfamiliar environment, expecting increased pay. This provided an incentive to work hard here when fixed-rate employees would feel depressed.\nSeeing the many other groups that came to the gate, Sinclair said: “There’s too many of them. What are we going to do?\nThe noble also wanted to use a performance-based pay for Sinclair and the others he hired. Though, Sinclair wouldn’t let this affect the miners.\nThe noble stood, wearing dungeon armor and clothes. Though, he made sure that the armor were lightweight and had smooth edges. If he truly wanted to go to the dungeons, he could. He liked talking about going to dungeons. But he was stuck to being a noble, and if he wanted to become a normal person with the same achievements, he would need to lose everything he owned. Instead of thinking about how wealthy he was supposed to be, he would rather imagine himself as someone who fought in dungeons for their life. He would read stories of people who did it and show favor toward adventurers.\nHe often forgot he was a noble, getting glued to seeing himself as those hardworking adventurers. He never felt content having the things he had. He felt more content wanting to struggle, be cool, and normal. The stories he read showed that going through hardships was struggles and still being this super unbeatable force who calmly did everything was the best thing. But the world betrayed him by making him take the responsibilites of a noble. They dared blame him for their suffering. He only cared about being normal, because he saw adventurers as the norm. And he saw the cool adventurers in stories as the norm. He wished he didn’t have to supervise the properties of his father, yet here he was, busy all the time. He was so tired of his modern life, and he wanted to live like an adventurer similar to the stories he read. He imagined the shop keeper, the taverns, the adventurous communities, the friendships, the magic, the satisfaction of getting stronger little by litte. He saw it all in his head, but he was stuck to a chair, having to do a job well done. He had to go to work and do the same stuff again and again, living a boring, lonely life. He wished that people cared about him, but no one did. His only escape was the hope that one day, he could be an adventurer. People called him special, since he was a noble. But he was just a normal person. Or, at least, he wanted to be. He wanted to work hard and struggle, fighting against evil and maybe becoming a force that no one could beat. All those who humiliated him, his older fellow nobles, would see him as this successful adventurer who was free to do whatever he wanted. Who cared if he was hated by society, specifically that of the nobles? He was so tired and just wanted to prove himself. He didn’t care whatsoever about anything. He just felt like becoming an adventurer. This world was so boring and stupid. He was so tired of people just talking down on him and treating him like he didn’t know anything or that he was immature for not being responsible or hardworking.\nThough, his desire for dungeons and adventuring came to a point where he kept asking his parents and ordering servants to make everything reflect that. He even bought dangerous potions, equipment, and magical artifacts, all of which were expensive. He was troublesome to his fellow nobles and family because he was so wasteful by buying all of these and not using them in the end.\nHe reasoned that he was going to give them away to adventurers, but he didn’t want to watch others adventure for him. He wanted to do it himself.\nBut he was never allowed to leave to the dungeons to adventure. If he did go there, he often attracted attention because of his retinue. He was scared of people hurting him for his noble status, making him hate his status even more.\nHe was living a boring, depressing, and anxious existence, where he had to work according to the expectations of society instead of achieving anything for himself. He hated himself for pretending to care about his duties. His family just wanted him to work hard until he died for nothing but a waste of time.\nHe hated society for this. But he respected adventurers for actually being straightforward and honest about the facts and what needed to be done—a confidence that he wanted for himself.\nIf his noble family realized that all of this time and effort toward making all of these pretty barrier structures was a waste of time and actually invested into beating monsters, people would be safe. The fact that people were already supporting adventurers and that his fellow nobles were starting to show signs of opposition toward adventurers was disgusting.\nHe heard about the recent news that some adventurers attacked and killed civilians. But he thought that it was his fellow nobles who orchestrated the incident to put the blame on adventurers. An agenda in place was making it so that adventurers were the bad guys.\nHe also heard about the incidents regarding the troll and the beasts, but he blamed nobles for not promoting adventurers enough to go to those areas and protect them. Building barriers was only beating around the bush, and people, particularly adventurers, were necessary to address these issues.\nIn the end, he was a victim of this society, and he would find a way out of this never-ending grind.\nNobles were traditionally a bunch of fanboys and fangirls of adventurers while happening to control society, so their interests and attendant beliefs became the formal norm.\nBack to the moment, Sinclair eyed the noble as he analyzed the other groups that came to the gate to repair it.\nThe face and posture of the noble and his dirty-looking clothes faced the crowd, his authority embracing his feet as he stood. His hair like a mane, he smiled, saying, “Okay, now, we should get this over it.”\nThe gate would start repairs, which would take a long time, but it also represented a critical geopolitical vantage point. So this was more than just a gate. This was a hand on the archipelagic stage, where its country, among many other cities, states, and countries, grew. The time of hope and war was coming.\nIn front of tensions, the nobles of this country were facing it. Today, the noble who called the crowd here represented the side of the country where the gate was. His name was Lord John Roger of Trogan, a principality ruled by the House of Notadam, with its residence in the district where Sinclair lived.\nFirst, John sped up the process by having each of them join him at an open lunch here in front of the gate to get people comfortable. They even had shade and many different kinds of food. This made it easier for the group to accustom themselves to the place, because they would be staying here for a long time. It was a commemorative opening to a long, dreary workload.\nThe time began, and it ticked, each moment implicating every single instance that happened throughout the country and internationally.\nSimilar to how Sinclair assessed boys by having them run around and do some work, John used the lunch as a way to assess each supervisor and laborer. This way, he could delegate the role of managing the supervisors elsewhere. If he relied too much on others, he knew that his authority would be compromised. So he had to put some effort in, so his closest workers would trust him. Seeing someone you trust address issues at hand and solve them by discussing them and giving people roles was stabilizing.\nAfter the lunch, when the work began, the miners looked at the sun and imagined themselves as little toy soldiers in a prison. If they finished work early, Sinclair promised he would reward them with bread and hot chocolate. This localized pastry was a bread with high egg and butter content, baked with butter and topped with grated cheese and sugar. The hot chocolate was made of pure ground roasted cacao beans, dissolved in water and milk.\nThis reward was almost everything to them in life today.\nThey licked their lips, feeling slight heat in their stomach and tense urges when imagining the taste of yummy crackers.\nFrom behind them, John Roger stood beside them and said: “You know, after all this time, I thought I would be able to find a way. There’s just so many memories in my mind.” He was 40 years old.\nHe sat on his haunches, taking a humble, familiar posture. “How is it like?”\nThe miners struggled to understand him. Even if John Roger’s words were accessible, his life wasn’t, so the nuance behind his words eluded them.\nThe miners said: “We just mine all day.”\nJohn Roger said: “Interesting.”\nThe miners thought he was mocking him, or they mocked him by accident. But they also were not completely sure. They thought that the noble had many very complex thoughts that they couldn’t possibly understand. It was just what nobles represented—the pinnacle of understanding and progress. They were the center stage of the world.\nBut John Roger really felt curious. He wanted to see what it was like to live a life worth living, because he felt that his was a waste of time. He really appreciated and loved the idea of mining all day, as long as he still was himself during this. Of course, he knew that his role as a noble was essential, but he didn’t want to be special this way. Just like how it was terrifying being the best in the world, it was terrifying being a noble. Many people only wanted to fit in and be normal, and this included John. If he could be free from this life, then maybe he would be able to be a good person, considering that nobles were too chaotic, overcomplicated, callous, hating, entitled, and nihilistic. He would rather have someone else take his place, because he just wanted to be part of a community, that of adventurers. He was never accepted for who he was as an individual, so instead of continuing to pretend in order to please others, he would rather stop pretending and be honest just for once in his life.\nNo one would accept him for who he was because he was a noble. When the role became the only way people got to know him, his self-image eroded as well. No one saw him for who he was. He was nothing.\nHe would become everything by becoming weak, frail, and human—the adventurer he knew symbolized this. The kind of human that kept going no matter what, even if he was nothing. It was because of this that he was everything. It was himself that he was content with, and it was through honesty with the world that he could be honest with himself.\nHe was tired of being judged for something he was not.\nHe was not a noble. The noble that he supposedly was had taken its own form and being. He was separate and estranged from it, only serving to house this being. It was no longer his satisfaction to maintain this illusion.\nHe was just a human being in the end.\nIf he could reach out…\nHe told the miners: “What are you guys doing right now, specifically?”\nThe miners knew he had ulterior motives, considering the sudden break of social norms, the confident tone, the relaxed posture and eye contact, and the history of nobles, among thousands of other things.\nThey knew that their answers had consequences, so they played it safe: “We’re just stripping here before we start excavating.” They were here for a construction and land development project, so this answer was correct.\nBut nobles had their whims, so they couldn’t help but keep their postures frozen.\nThey realized they made a mistake and forgot to call him “Lord”, but they were too terrified to move and beg for mercy.\nJohn Roger didn’t like the word “Lord”, so he only let people use it in formal settings. But he preferred if people called him by his name alone.\nGetting up to leave, he said: “Okay.”\nNobles had celebrity status, similar to seeing one’s favorite famous “humble” idol in person, so they were both exhilarated and intimidated for their life.\nIf he wanted to, he could send a military force and try how well their skin responded to blades, arrows, and magical projectiles.\nThe next day, on day 19, John Roger, after all the pain and suffering, decided to carry on as usual, because that was what adventurers did.\nIf adventurers betrayed him, he wouldn’t be happy. If anyone had a tantrum, that would be fine. But the problem was that he was a noble. He had more than just a retinue of armed followers. These followers were meant to be stronger than adventurers.\nEveryday beasts were vastly weaker than adventurers, and common monsters were usually at their mercy.\nSo John Roger would be able to tear down adventurers if he wanted to.\nNow, this was merely security. The complicated aspects happened in governance and management, rather than just physical power dynamics.\nWith that said, John Roger’s presence was complete, and Sinclair only had to do as he was told, which meant supervising his miners.\nJohn’s face and shadow lay upon them all, the land, the land development project, the groups of hundreds of laborers under respective supervisors in distinct spots, and the interactions between them to assess overall progress iteratively.\nFor now, he was their god.\nChapter 16 - Trapped in the Dungeon link Author’s Note\nI apologize for the sudden hiatus of 3 months, 20 days, 16 hours, and 27 minutes. I appreciate your understanding.\nMoving away from John, relocating focus inside a dungeon, 2 days ago, on day 17, Shadrach was watching the holes in the walls and the various curbs within the giant squarely nested chambers with corridors connecting each chamber. The zombies appeared from the ground, coming up from pistons. It looked like they came from an hidden area under the chambers.\nThe zombies were getting killed with so much gore, and the adventurers were shouting, not with joy, just with fear whenever a zombie came too close or bit them.\nShadrach’s abstracted gaze was that of emotional detachment from the traumatizing things around them. This was analogous to the one he showed in the fatal incident where around 40 of his fellow apprentice miners died horrifically to a troll.\nHe half-slept in the dungeon, as the adventurers were staying there before passing onto the next chamber.\nWhen he saw and heard one of the adventurers sneezing, he came to his senses and began writing down what he saw.\nHe wrote: “Zombie, zombie, blood.” He thought that he could explain later in further detail, but he was exhausted.\nIn this setting, the dungeon and the surrounding, infrequently intruding caves was large and very complex, and it had so many intrusions like dikes, sills, and laccoliths, especially since volcanic activity was frequent in the archipelago. The surface of the walls often looked altered and deformed around these intrusions. But intrusions also formed mineral deposits on the cave walls. Basically, the cave looked colorful and diverse in texture with some visible ores.\nMeanwhile, Shadrach thought he was free, but every time he wanted to understand, he felt himself freeze up.\nIf he stopped caring, maybe, he would free. But his body went against his choices. It was choosing for him. He was stuck in a body he couldn’t control.\nTerror, fear, loss.\nIf he became god, then maybe he would become free from his torment.\nThe 13-year-old boy imagined the nobles and had a feeling that they secretly played the same children’s games of life and knew all the answers.\nHe couldn’t even word out what he felt. That was what it felt like to be young and bereft of formal education.\nHe had a mouth, but he couldn’t scream.\nInstead, the adventurers showed him one more alternative: violence.\nIf he could learn how to commit to memory their movements, fighting stances, attack and dodge moves, group dynamics, and finishing combos, then he would be able to render his grief transposed into a rustic, murderous glory.\nHe wrote down two more words: “Remember move.” He meant “dynamics” by “move”, but his knowledge was limited for now.\nHe was just a regular guy who lived a pauper life, so instead of thinking one-sidedly about violence, he remembered his other options. This included his journey from the structural city to the dungeon of the wild.\nThis wild was the trees, the sugar canes, the lakes in the distance, horizontally moving clouds, rising sun, the gray skies during rare days of rain in the dry season, and hints of a district on the horizon, among others. As for the vegetation, they included fruit-bearing ones such as banana trees and moringa plants, palm trees such as areca palms, dracaena and dragon trees, flowering trees such as orchid trees, shrubs such as hairy figs, vines and climbers such as ivy gourd, grasses and grass covers such as buffalograss, medicinal and useful plants such as okra plant, and miscellaneous plants such as golden dewdrops.\nIf vegetation felt like a dead fish, then the wild had animals too: warty pigs, deers, and crocodiles, among others. Indeed, these mentioned ones would survive 98 percent deforestation.\nThird and fourth, the facet of beasts, as opposed to regular animals, and monsters such as zombies, skeletons, trolls, and goblins introduced a threat that initially seemed to align only with magic and adventurers. But their interplay of each other along with vegetation and animals was interdependent. The role of beasts and monsters was to slow down human encroachment and expansion, especially considering that magic empowered humans.\nTo give a more dynamic perspective, all these vegetation, animals, beasts, and monsters engaged in an exchange process, wherein each of their byproducts, including solid and liquid waste, bones, feathers, wool, milk, eggs, and leather, and their carrion itself served as a commodity for the economy, or natural ecosystem. When it came to the nutritional strategies and social environment of animals, they served as the commodities of their community structures. These represented their “coping mechanisms” to navigate their “society”, or ecosystem, amid alien effects such as slash-and-burn agriculture intended to create mountainside swiddens.\nSo humans were more than just a society and economy in itself. They controlled the natural ecosystem.\nFinally, the human Shadrach would build any city, explore the land, and do whatever he wanted.\nTomorrow, he and rest of his friends would meet the goblins for a possible mercenary work, hopefully with employee benefits this time. His current boss Leroy didn’t even assist the family of his late apprentice miners after his negligence that contributed to them dying brutally.\nShadrach and his friends would get the win.\nHe looked up toward the sky, only to stare at the openings, crevices, and fissures of the dungeon.\nNow that he was in the dungeon for over 18 hours now, he finally started a conversation with the adventurers instead of only answering questions from them. Namely, he asked the adventurers when they got a 2-min break before the next wave of zombies: “Where’s the thing… that does the thing?”\n“Huh?” said one of the adventurers, as he moved down a practically empty potion from his mouth.\nShadrach began trying to explain to them what he meant.\nIn his mind, he had been trying everything, so it was just that he completely get rid of any presumptuous thoughts. This was his last chance to make it. Even if it did not seem like a lot, he would make sure that this time was his time to shine. He had no wishes to start over. Today, he was growing the tree of growth whether it would come along easy or not.\nTwo days later, on day 19, the miners noticed the one of the other groups a half distance away eating chicken, raising their brows, since it was a luxurious food. They wondered if this was a power play.\nIncidentally, as for the background of the luxurious chicken, many years ago, it was declared to be a luxury good. Now, at the present around several weeks ago, the king raised the luxury tax on chicken to 150 percent of the sale price. This was in order to prepare for the funding needed to transition away from adventurers. Basically, a fixed-rate miner now had to work a full day to afford one-third chicken. So chicken became state-owned from the farm level. Though, privileged citizens were exempted from raising chickens.\nFor bonus clarity, the king’s change led to merchants with concessions selling chicken for inflated prices. The king justified the taxes by saying that people could instead eat pork which he deemed healthier than chicken and which would support the local pork farms and breweries while chicken led to money leaving the country. As for why he mentioned the breweries, pork was often paired with beer.\nIn the end, the king just wanted a little money, as the treasury was expected to be empty after adventurers were not the main focus of the government anymore.\nWith all that said, the miners still had the characteristic deliberation of people. If the miners could find a way to navigate around trouble, the removal of which was requested from them, maybe the regal noble would pay their boss Sinclair heed. This would trickle down to them, even if it was just a lick of commendatory saliva. Any praise had connotations far beyond their feeble lives. Hopefully, they would rise, even by a small addition to their pay. This would be exemplary to them. “Yummy!” they said to humor each other, thinking about this concern while tasting the most delicious bread.\nThey began to speak in one of the common languages besides English.\n“Hey, gusto mo naman kumain diyan,” said one of the miners, Ronaldo, his hair golden and his eyes sparkling blue, “pero wag mo naman tapunin yan.”\nHe was mildly disapproving of the fact that the person he was talking to, Carter, chose to sit down at a certain spot. He also warned him regarding throwing something away.\n“Talaga ba?” added another, Alice, wearing a beautiful red coat. He regarded himself a gentleman despite the lady’s name.\nThe statement of doubt “Talaga ba?” could be translated directly to “Really?”\nA third, Carter, replied to Ronaldo, his wide smile similar to that of a fox: “Ha? Parang nakapulot ko lang ito ngayon. Anong meron sayo? Kung gusto mo talagang tapusin ito… Tapusin mo gamit ang iyong puso!”\nCarter was acting wittily by feigning confusion and pretending to have only picked up a certain thing now. He said that if Ronaldo really wanted to finish something, he should finish it with his heart.\nDirect translations of their words would fail to get the nuance, but they burst into laughter as part of some unknown inside joke.\nA fourth miner among them was merely listening, feeling comfortable with an erect back and an attentive disposition. His dissimilarity by not laughing was normal and a characteristic part of group dynamics. Not everyone needed to be attentive, the center of attention, or engaged in humor all the time. It was just that when a joke landed, it hit hard. If it didn’t, they were still friends. It was more than just a transaction of jokes. Their relationship was more than just an audience and the funny guy. It was dependent on shared experiences and a sense of belonging.\nIt was about the connection and support they offered each other and the understanding that they were more than just a group of individuals—they were a tight-knit community.\nBut this community extended far beyond this little squadron. It was a collection of individuals under different circumstances, all longing after the same thing: success, happiness, and friendship.\nThey knew that their lives relied on this tight unit of awesomeness.\nSo instead of pretending to be special or edgy, they did their thing and were honest with each other and their flaws and vulnerabilities. It was a place of acceptance, hope, and integrity.\nThey could be themselves yet part of a group where they could be normal.\nThey didn’t have to pretend to get attention. They just were part and parcel of a group that provided each other with a chance and a voice: a way of life.\nSo if danger struck, they and everyone else would be scrambling, all within a complex world full of hegenomies and terrors of the skies. They would fight in this iterative world that longed to tear itself apart—a desire for chaos: entropy.\nThe isolated and marginalized ones that received no support would tear down the love these kind people embraced in the process while targeting the human devils of this earth.\nMeanwhile, the boss of the miners, Sinclair, wearing a red coat, emerged nearby. Moreover, he gave a polite thumbs-up to one miner, Alice, who also wore a red coat.\nHe was the reason why Alice could wear a coat in the tropical heat, having rewarded the miners with bread that had magical properties, specifically those that cooled the consumer. Even if the coat insulated the heat, wearing a coat was cool (badass).\nTo give some context, the rich people wore coats made of abaca, piña (pineapple fibers), and banana fibers in the tropical heat, using magic to keep cool. Since simple clothing was considered to provide less variety, they persisted. This influenced non-rich people.\nElsewhere, in a dungeon far from the city center, the only relevant people having life-or-death action currently were the group of adventurers Sinclair hired to accompany Shadrach and kill 50 goblins.\nThe problem was that goblins were hard to find. This was unfortunately because they didn’t go to the dungeon on the day Sinclair wanted them to. Instead, they had gone a day after the initial date due to one of them passing away. In the end, the adventurers decided to give up. But not before one more monster fight.\nSeveral arrows flew from skeleton archers, and the adventurers fell to the ground.\nHe grabbed a healing potion and drank it, making the arrows fade into dust.\nTwo more arrows flew, one piercing a shield, and hurting the knee of one adventurer barely having enough time to switch rotations with the group.\nThe group rotated, dancing around like a fire dragon.\nThe skeleton archers and zombies merely focused on attacking the closest adventurers: a parade of angels seeking out evil men.\nTwo zombies blocked the way of one adventurer, grabbing his arms.\nThe skeleton used his shield to push them away, but he was down for the count after using too much energy to retreat.\nFive more adventurers currently in action remained.\nTwo adventurers slashed two zombies’ heads, but the temples of the zombies were thick, only feeling a slight rotation.\nThe adventurers did a combo, slashing several times subsequently, burtsing a heads of the zombies like watermelons.\nThe rest of the zombies chased one adventurer, grabbing him and biting his head.\nThe adventurers threw potions that splashed all over the adventurer, preventing his death.\nThe shield potions provided a damage buffer that prevented the adventurer from dying, while the healing potions healed the adventurer back to full health.\nThe zombies kept attacking, as the skeletons interrupted the charge of the group of adventurers.\nSince the place where they fought was small, they had to keep changing positions, resulting in exhaustion easily.\nThe adventurers backed away, one of them pulled away the adventurer who was being grabbed all over his body.\nShadrach watched and wrote down certain symbols and words in a disjointed but concise manner, trusting his memories to understand himself later.\nOnce the fight finished, the monsters and adventurers halted their fight for now, maybe until they met again.\nEarlier, a punch of rewards dropped from the monsters’ bodies, so it was necessary that Shadrach try to pick up one of them for himself.\nThe adventurers were concerned for their safety, as they were focused on getting in and out as fast as possible, marking milestones in a shorter time relative to monsters killed and price of resources and repair. They were necessarily economical as characteristic of their high–fatal-injury-rate profession.\nThey were professional: they wiped their things dry, stored them in segregated pouches, discarded trash, cleaned up themselves, and cleaned up after themselves. Moreover, they wrote a report of the activities of their party. This was why they relied on adventurer guilds because of the complicated bureacratic process of abiding by the law. Their responsibilites sounded simple enough; though, they risked their life every time. This meant constant training. People didn’t have periods of training and then stopped because they were strong enough. Training happened everyday, and skipping training meant atrophy of both muscles and magic. Taking breaks was great, but they trained everyday for 2 hours. They either chose to take breaks one day a week or for 4 days every month. That was a suggested practice of successful adventurers. But the most successful adventurers did everything second-nature, and they were flexible enough to rely on context to switch up methods and plans. Overgeneralized suggestions were merely for entry-level newbies. “Newbies” referred to those who had spent two years working under the supervision and guidance of more experienced senior colleagues.\n“It depends,” was a common answer from successful adventurers, since techniques and guidelines faded into the background when a master was on the field. All masteries have been turned instinctive, similar to a whirlwind that knows not the science behind its greatness. It just was.\nAs for a status reminder of the overall world 19 days since Maverick’s first appearance, all aforementioned parties were currently separated. These parties included (1) Shadrach and the adventurer party, (2) the miners absent in the gate building, (3) the miners present, Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair, the other groups, and the noble John Roger of Trogan, (4) what was left of the boy group of Sinclair, which included Nathan, Robert, Billy, and Notch, 7 other boys, and 2 women, (5) Goldberg and the Marchacha goblins, (6) the followers of Sinclair, (7) the troll, (8) the 47 friends, 20 contacts, and 15 enemies that the boy group made by networking, (9) the task master Sprutnoa, and (10) the laborer Inframark. Other less immediate parties include officials, adventurers, and nobles. As for deceased parties, they included Millie, Maverick, a portion of his fellow laborers, 48 of the apprentice miners of Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair, and the marginalized adventurers who attacked citizens.\nWhen it came to the dynamics between the living parties, they interacted indirectly through the wide circuit of the city. Now, as for the distinction between the city, its districts, and its country, the country and the city were the same. The “country” often referred to the region rather than the city, which was a nation-state.\nAs for the height of their activities, the boy group used to have the most action. But now, due to the traumatic event, they were now resting and in a state of recovery. The fighting between monsters and adventurers were ongoing, but the adventurer Goldberg was still imprisoned.\nNow that most of the aforementioned individuals were either dealing politically, in a state of rest and recovery, or undergoing monotonous work, the perspective of a simple adventurer’s life should be sufficient.\nSpeaking of which, this simple adventurer was sitting down at the city center.\nChapter 17 - The Unveiling of Charles Finch linkRegarding the name of the simple adventurer sitting down at the city center, it was “Charles Finch.”\nIf he wanted to do something, he did it. He had an in-depth understanding of the world, and he was old enough to have had been part of good and bad again and again for 20 years. It was not the everyday mood shifting. It was being part of communities that went well and part of ones that went sore to the point of dissolution. He saw all kinds of ways people showed kindness through empathy, and he saw all kinds of ways people manipulated another using a high level of emotional intelligence.\nSo he could easily intercept his thoughts and where his biases lay. But he also continously pushed himself to his lips.\nThis was not why he signed up to become an adventurer five days ago. He did this because he felt that sooner or later, he had to face what was coming—what he felt was the inevitability of adventurers. It was similar to the inevitability of going to university for nobles.\nAs an adventurer, he had to face many kinds of friction. One source of conflict was that adventuring could be dog-eat-dog machismo when nobles or nobles’ associates were involved. So he had to let himself get humiliated if he wanted to live, as his body was already susceptible to illness and age-related physical debility. He had to learn how to humble himself before younger men who had too much fun doing whatever they wanted. He was fine with being humiliated, and he knew how to stay down. He knew that the only thing he could do was be patient and focus on his goals. He knew what it was like to stare outside at night and look outside, only to see tall buildings blocking his sight of the sky. He knew what it felt like to wake up in the morning and hear the sounds of voices he feared and go into fight-or-flight mode every gosh dang time. He was tired of pretending to be special. Emotionally, he was coping by tossing his frustration into walking and hearing the rain. But he could only do so much. This was his struggle after dealing with childhood trauma.\nBut he was going to be free one day. So, he would do his best today and keep going. He had lost hope for a better world for himself. He would only keep going, but he would not win. He would not feel validation. He would not get a hug in the night. He would not see the sky and pretend not to despise the way it laughed and mocked him. He remembered a time where he met good people. He remembered the good memories he had growing up as a kind, humble boy. But that was gone now. The boy was ruined and tossed like a doll. But he was still him. He was still that boy.\nHe still cared when he saw a child’s face. He knew that this child did not deserve this pain. He knew that that child deserved so much more. He would do everything to make those children happy again. He would save himself in the process and be the person he was looking for in those dark days.\nHe would save himself.\nHis siblings were gone now, and he felt guilt over standing still and not running to intervene and help them.\nHe could only break, keeping going. His pain and his perseverance was synonymous.\nTo everyone else, he was just a random adventurer, one of a group, one of a thousand, one of a million, one that the best heroes and villains ignore.\nHe was afraid of success. He was afraid of becoming just like them. He was afraid that he would hurt something in the process. He deserved to suffer, because it was the only way he could stay humble. If he succeeded, he would destroy everything and everyone in the process. And maybe, he would be convinced that he was right. He was merely a human. If God gave him power, he would kill the world. He was just a human.\nYet, he was nothing. All his pride and ego were gone.\nAll he had was this motivation that never burned out. It was at its peak all the time.\nHe would destroy the suffering of this earth.\nHe remembered his siblings. One, he remembered his small younger sibling crying with both hands rubbing both eyes. Two, he remembered the small crying voice of his youngest sibling being abused right in front of him, but he was too terrified to do anything. The perpetrator was someone he trusted.\nHe trusted them. He gave the heart and hope that he heard about. He believed in the integrity that he heard about. Yet, they were callous and cold-hearted. They were hypocrites.\nIf he was evil, then, it was best that someone killed him.\nHe had to do something, even if he deserved to die.\nHe heard his brothers’ voices. He heard the voices of the hundreds of other people who had been kind to him and had yet to betray him.\nTears dripped down his cheeks like a tooth from the first set. His walk was faltering in rhythm, and his body periodically shifted uncomfortably. His head rotated and twisted expressively in wavy motions. His face twitched, as he battled the pain.\nIt was during this anguish.\nHe would become everything.\nHe felt that he didn’t address enough of his emotions, but this would do for now, even if this made him feel empty and vulnerable.\nSince he was a good person, it was only right that he got empowerment.\nIn the physical world, several hooded figures emerged behind him and handed him a lot of swords, daggers, wands, bags of gold, dangerous potions, other equipment, and magical artifacts. Moreover, they began to cast a transformative spell on him.\nHe became physically healthy, and his body returned to 35 years old.\nAll his complications turned into dust.\nHe grabbed one of the swords and slashed it around, staring at the hooded figures. “I’m just a boy,” he said.\nWhen he said he was part of a community when he was a younger, he meant that he was a very obedient youth who was used as a prime example of what to follow.\nSo, any chance of becoming part of something excited him, as with empowerment came the opportunity to help others in the process.\nTo give some context for the sudden intrusion of the hooded figures, the war between adventurers and monsters was a part of the stable system of the country. This was similar to how wars could span for one hundred years without each side getting completely destroyed in only a few weeks. In conclusion, entities and organizations that had the power to influence individuals like Charles were active.\nMore relevantly, people like the hooded figures randomly giving money to random people like Charles Finch was part of a stable system. Moreover, these weird actions were the release of accumulated stress, similar to earthquakes. Finally, they might seem rare, but they were inevitable.\nThe hooded figures explaned to him what he needed to do, leading the way to a dungeon that had a breathing core.\nHe was about to interact with the core and see what the hell was going on.\nTo clarify, the hooded figures were followers of the aforementioned noble John Roger, and John wanted a random passerby, Charles Finch, to live out his fantasy of becoming an adventurer: vested interest. In conclusion, the items Charles received were John’s. By the way, John’s reasons were much more complex than this.\nIn the end, the character, Charles, would become the great hand of the user, John.\nInstead of speeding up his pace to catch up, Charles stopped, as the hooded figures stared at him. Rather than responding angrily, the figures waited as if expecting him to show some hesitation.\nBeing an empathetic person, Charles voiced out his thoughts for both himself and the figures: “Why am I doing this? Have I really thought about this? Is this really the right thing to do?” For him, voicing out his thoughts was the same was close to thinking them, since he had strong integrity and honesty. Similarly, when he was younger, he even believed that people knew his thoughts at one point due to him having a high opinion of others.\nInstead of answering him, the figures watched him, learning from his expressions. A strong rational understanding of people characterized them, but their little experience in living in tight-knit social communities that emphasized collaboration and cohesion rather than competition and hierarchical strictness was part of their arsenal of flaws. In the end, while Charles provided a breath of relief, the figures provided him with a sense of belonging.\nSince Charles was taking up their time, the figures tried to use this time to write down notes regarding his humanity, but their notes were vague and cryptic. And they had poor pattern recognition skills and thereby weak memory formation in the social territory. But they were familiar with each other, so they used their perception of people through their interactions with each other. Ultimately, this formed a biased, insufficient collection of details in their notes. But they were sure that this was sufficient enough.\nAs soon as Charles made up his mind about his current situation, he asked them who they were. Moreover, he added that they could ignore his request if the answers were confidential.\nFrom the figures’ side, an eye at each other was all they needed, as identifying each others’ understanding of the situation was brief. Furthermore, handing the man in front of them a paper with all their hands supporting it was their gesture of respect, especially within the social etiquette that cupped the city.\nEven if the man in front of them traced his roots to a different linguistic regional variation, accent, or both, he would surely recognize the gesture stemming from the bourgeoisie and, by extension, the city itself.\nBut Charles paid little sophisticated attention to anything. So he just nodded and went on his way. This effectively wrapped up the interaction without him needing to stay in prolonged silence, overshare, or delve into intellectual tangents as nobles tended to do at events.\nThough, the figures stopped him before Charles showed further disrespect. “Please tell me your full name before acting familiar with us,” one of them said.\nEven if Charles thought their reaction was predictable and avoidable, he was scared, since they sounded adamant about a respectful association between him and them. He nodded before saying, “I am Charles Finch.”\nThe figures looked satisfied. “Okay, Charles Finch, my name is Elizabeth. Her name is Mary, and her name is Sarah. Since we regularly attend dangers as guards, we’ll encircle you as we lead the way, so please follow in between us instead of going in front of us, okay?”\nA yes leapt out of Charles’ mouth.\nWhile he waited, Elizabath high-stepped carefully over densely vegetated, rocky terrain past him.\nSecondly, Mary watched him, holding onto the handles of her two sheathed blades.\nThird, Sarah was looking around patiently. Since she was bored, she began discussing with Mary and Elizabeth politely concerning information further explaining the background behind the adventurers who had attacked civilians.\nMeanwhile, the news worried Charles. Thinking that he was intimidated by the three women, Mary recited a memorized transcription to Charles: “I’m just a girl, okay? Don’t be scared. Just chillax. We can have some fun, okay?”\nCharles stopped with disbelief.\nStopping one step after him, Elizabeth glanced at him and then between Mary and Sarah, thinking that Charles’ ambiguous actions were might become troublesome in a life-or-death situation. “Please tell me why you’re stopping,” she said.\nCharles said, “I was just surprised… when I heard the news about the attack.”\nElizabeth said okay and moved on, Mary and Sarah catching up in a jiffy.\nSince they were at an important crossroad of multiple trails and paths, they sighted an outpost in the distance. Crossroads like this were essential as a communication hub like how an elbow connected the forearm and the upper arm. But in the case of these crossroads, the elbow would be separated into a loose group of sub-elbows. This meant more flexibility but also less centralization. This was like having a lot of malleable clay to play around with, but they couldn’t stick together into one giant mass because the weight would break them apart. In conclusion, crossroads were not meant to be a giant centralized settlement or camp, so sticking them together them would require lots of resources to maintain. And it wouldn’t be sustainable for their intended purpose.\nWith the flexible movement established, they served as a checker that could respond to new demands and redirect movement along other more efficient routes. This was similar to how the adrenal glands managed hormones like adrenaline and cortisol in response to stress, danger, and everyday exercise. If a checker like this was absent, people would continue to flow repetitively, redundantly, dangerously, and slowly indefinitely like a bunch of rats after a hole into their hideout was made. From another angle, if they knew their directions and where to go, the checking still made sure that the people were safe and not enemy soldiers casually walking in and killing everyone. Furthermore, many stories of people disguising as citizens just walking between members of a group and assassinating the leader circulated. To explain, these leaders were complacent for forgoing bureacratic processes to make sure things made sense objectively. Finally, crossroads were part of a necessary set of processes similar to glands of the human body that ensured homeostatis instead of imbalance or dysregulation. If one opposed the concept of bureaucracy rather than individual bureaucrats, the type of government, or the current administration or head of state, their natural body was a bureaucracy of checks and balances.\nMeanwhile, Shadrach, Billy, and Notch were together again. It didn’t feel like they had been apart. Several days without seeing a close friend was normal from time to time, but it was rare for them.\nGrowing up, each of them went everywhere and knew the complexities of the city with the various buildings and great variety of spots. The whole city was place of accessibility and ease, and they got to know a few hundred people here. They remembered how the city changed overtime. Sadly, they threw away items that could have served as reminders of those times. Fortuantely, they were still young and still had time to keep experiencing and learning before they would regret. Though, the three only got to know each other through Maverick 19 days ago. Yet, 19 days was more than enough to become the greatest of friends. It was like 3 straight weeks in a camp together full of hundreds of other groups and communities.\nSince their early childhood until now, they moved on from many games, experiences, friendships, and spots, each of which took their time for about an hour at least and 6 years at most. Many of these activities happened simultaneously, but one by one, they would slowly detach and go away.\nThey struggled with malnutrition and lack of formal education, both of which caused cognitive impairment to varying degrees depending on the severity and the timing of exposure. Despite this, it was their unrestricted play, travel, the one-on-one instruction they received from others and each other, and social development that made them the people they were today.\nIn conclusion, they had to wage a war against the earthly crawl for destruction. They could do this by tearing open their mental chests full of knowledge and experience and packaging it into a useable tool.\nWith the fate of the boys in a relatively stable state of progression, Charles Finch deserved a conclusion to his journey.\nChapter 18 - The Journey’s Harrowing Toll linkElsewhere, in the forest, after being told off and inspected by a group of soldiers, Charles, Mary, Sarah, and Elizabeth went to another route.\nDespite their stiff and regulated social skills, the three women each had a sense of self-esteem.\nElizabeth was made of brick and stone, bone and tar, red and blue, cold ice and fiery furnace hot coals, night and day, sun and shine, and morning and dim lights hanging by like sun at midday, deathly and threading slower and slower.\nShe was free.\nSarah tasted banana, using magic to remove the seeds. She was very precise yet casual with her movements, calmly eating the banana and throwing the seeds away.\nMary kept repeating three actions. One, she clasped the rubbery skin of her forearm with two fingers. Two, she stared at the sky. Three, she sauntered with her free arm swinging softly.\nThe presence of Charles as a stranger made Elizabeth restrain her mind from wandering for presence of identity, Sarah more casual in demeanor, and Mary particularly expectant of danger, analyzing each action she identified.\nThe forest made Elizabeth periodically confident in herself, Sarah rub her head from time to time in case of dirt, Mary twist her head inwardly and focus on her peripheral view, and Charles somewhat bored but less tense.\nCharles and the three women felt settled, having their egos down. If life decided to throw another rock at them, they were too complete ever to feel so lost that they could not find themselves bouncing back. In the past, they addressed many difficult issues and answered many challenging questions for themselves by themselves. With that said, they didn’t know everything, but they all had achieved self-fulfillment.\nThe scary thing about self-fulfillment was that they could do anything and be anything they had to. This was in order to abide by their deeply held beliefs and aspirations. Simultaneously, they trusted role models to guide them even when independent. In the end, they had endless motivation.\nIn particular, Charles and the three women would become the epitome of grace and beauty.\nThey didn’t need revenge, because they would just do what they had to in order to maintain stability within themselves.\nBut within them lay repressed memories that would give them the opportunity to do evil things.\nThis was on the condition that these memories were made vulnerable and open with unresolved or suppressed grief and coupled with intense emotions.\nFor instance, a statement was embedded within one of these memories: “I miss you Alex, I really do. I wish you could be here right now…”\nNow that Charles had more things to do besides just walking in a forest and awkwardly waiting for the journey to finish, he said, “Dang, goblins must be so near us right now. I imagine that they will come out any second now.”\n“No, no, they’re far away.”\n“Honestly, magic must be so easy to learn. I saw someone do fire magic without trying. My niece even learned it. It must be so easy nowadays.”\n“No, it takes a while. Here, try this: ‘LALALLLL’”\n“What’s that?”\n“A spell.”\n“LOLALLLL”\n“Almost correct.”\n“LALALOLL”\n“No.\n“LALALLLL”\n“Good.”\n“What the hell is this?” Charles said disappointedly, his face like that of a melting clay figure.\n“Magic,” Elizabeth said with deeper disappointment, since he still looked confused after she went the extra mile for him. “Have you any idea of anything?”\n“I know it. I just don’t know when was the last time I did anything with it. I used to be so involved with people doing all that kind of stuff.”\nHe continued in a distant voice: “But now, it feels like a past life.”\nElizabeth shrugged with confusion. “Okay, then. What do we do with that?”\nHe shrugged, mirroring her.\nShe wanted to ask rhetorically what they were here for then, but she deemed herself too polite to do that.\nIn any case, she went the extra mile and fetched the other girls’ attention before they started having long, distracted discussions about whatever. They were doing substandard work here, and she was not happy about it. It was her duty to follow in the footsteps of her predecessors, but in reality, she was just a girl. She could pretend all she wanted, but she was aware that no matter what happened, she would be just that little rat sitting down in the grass pondering about the universe. Now, she was actually doing something, but she had to do it right. It was not easy, but she had to keep going. If only she could get closer to the fight where it was much more glorious, then she would be happy. If she wore those uniforms like the rest of the men, she would feel accepted and part of the great advancement of society into the new age. But she needed results.\nShe extended her arm in an immediate, tense manner.\nAs soon as they reached their destination, a dungeon with a dungeon core, she felt a sudden chill creeping over her, shivering involuntarily. She failed to answer basic questions in her head, as a feverish head spread through her body. Fatigue set in, and weakness gripped her muscles. A sharp pain emerged at the back of her neck. Instinctively, she touched the tender, swollen area. Panic set in as she realized she could die. Sweat formed on her forehead, and the fatigue settled deep in her bones. Within moments, Elizabeth found herself on the ground.\nThe fight with monsters was a major factor in pandemics throughout history, so what Elizabeth experienced was a plague.\nMary grabbed Charles who was accompanying Elizabeth closely and pulled him aside, while Sarah immediately exited the range of Elizabeth’s potential sneezing and coughing.\nPotions fell, and healing incantations were enough to calm them down.\nBut Elizabeth’s condition needed more than just wound healing magic. Magic-resistant bacteria was an issue.\nShe would die several days later.\nThe best way to fight gloriously was in a decisive war, but in a war of attrition, it was worse, considering that diseases spread better. She was getting no glory when she died here.\nCharles stared at a human being, Elizabeth, wondering what the point of his life as another human being. If she never reached her dreams, how could he pretend to understand?\nSo he sat down, not a single tear dripping. He was not going to pity her. She didn’t deserve that kind of mistreatment. She wanted glory, so she would have it. Instead, he would carry her dreams forward.\nDespite the fact that she was still alive, she was already dead.\nBut Charles was not inhuman nor callous. When he saw a human being, he saw a galaxy full of stars, particles unimaginable in complexity, chemical reactions, and human intelligence sequencing thousands of years’ worth of knowledge. He could not bear but feel the weight of a life.\nBecause he saw a human being, his grief was inevitable.\nIn Charles’ world, many thought they were going to be heroes, listening to the feeling of elucidation that propaganda that glorified oppression and the avoidance of issues altogether gave. But they just wanted to make sense of things with all the unpredictability, helplessness, and humiliation. It was too hard to be optimistic while accepting confusion.\nSooner or later, a person would have to stare upon the inevitable and say okay, and Charles knew that. But he felt scared still. He was not god. He was just a guy.\nIn the end, he had to do something, so instead of believing destiny, he said he was not special and he could die anytime. So frick everything. He grabbed Elizabeth and repeated that she would get help. Cough and sneezes fell onto Charles, as Mary and Sarah alarmingly shouted at him to wait.\nCharles ran, tears streaming down his face. If he needed power, it was now. He begged for power. He begged to save one person at least for once in his life. He had to do something.\nHe wanted to be god right now, so he could help this person.\nBut Elizabeth didn’t deserve to be pitied like this. She was a person like he was.\nBut he had to do something. He was sorry for intruding in her death, because, just maybe, she would be fine with dying. Yet, he couldn’t help himself.\nHe would not watch a person suffer. He would not sit down and pretend. He would not stand still.\nThis time, he had to do something. He had to try. He would not watch his siblings suffer.\nElizabeth represented the siblings he failed to save in his childhood. These siblings represented himself when he trusted and hoped. But no one saved him.\nHe would have to be the person his child self was looking for.\nWhen he reached a familiar tower, he begged for help.\nThe tower belonged to his father who subjected him to harmful treatment when he was growing up. He would empower Elizabeth once again with his expertise in healing magic.\nIt was his father that helped him refine his empathy through how rageful he got, serving as a helpful contrast between different kinds of people, but he was a person, not a benefactor nor a victim. He couldn’t accept being a victim, and his father taught him that.\nWhen Elizabeth found herself healthy again, the father began asking about Charles’ health, work, and if he was doing well. It sounded casual, but Charles’ experience with him allowed him to infer the true meanings behind his words. It was targeted passive aggression that would mean nothing to anyone else, but with their long history, it would make him have panic attacks. But he was better now.\nNow, at least, he was only shaking slightly with his left hand, which he hid behind his other arm when he crossed his arms.\nCharles thanked his father and allowed him to blabber, listening with a stoic expression.\nWhen he was finished and Charles and the women were leaving, his father called out, telling him to do good.\n“Do good,” was the strongest trigger to Charles. If it was anyone else, it meant a polite, kind gesture. Though, to him, it was like experiencing everything all over again.\nWhen his father was out of sight, he stared into the distance, his eyes becoming moist. This was a small reaction for his acute pain, and this was only the latest among thousands of past instances.\nHe was nothing. His father helped teach him that.\nBut he mattered, because the kind people who influenced him did. They taught him that.\nIt didn’t matter. He had to keep going, as he always did.\nHe couldn’t stop himself.\nIn the meantime, Mary and Sarah were not only crying. They were actually respecting the sounds of the wilderness while maintaining their composure. They exuded an aura of sagely and experienced souls.\nEarlier, they thanked Charles, but he didn’t register what they said until 10 minutes into their walk back to the dungeon. At this time, he glanced at the women one by one, feeling a newfound understanding of them.\nHe remembered one of the times he almost died and felt thankful for Elizabeth’s healing. Though, he assessed his morals and actions, feeling some doubt. If he was a symbol of righteousness, he might know what was the best thing to do at any moment, but he was just a guy, making imperfect decisions. Maybe, one decision he made would lead to disastrous consequences. But he was just doing his best. If he thought he knew everything, he would not be here today.\nBut despite the resilience and kindness Charles expressed, there were no rules, no time tables, and no plan. Tomorrow, he could do something unspeakable.\nOnce they reached the dungeon, the rules that applied in the dungeon Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair’s boys entrered only applied to itself and not to this new dungeon.\nMeanwhile, in this dungeon, which was used as part of a massive road network, a thousand goblins were amassing, hundreds of them carrying various limited supplies. Time was running, and they had to reach their destination, a virgin expanse where they could established camp.\nRather than being part of conflict-driven political dynamics, goblins were a diverse people. Moreover, a large portion of goblins, including the aforementioned thousand goblins, coveted magic for decentralized development, leveraging the unique strengths and resources of various regions. To sum, they eschewed conflict and preferred the paradise that their destination presented.\nIn the end, these goblins were merely one of many groups around the world entertaining adventure and travel.\nThe problem was that there were too many.\nSo lines had to be drawn, and people had to argue over which belonged to whom. It was a good thing that the world had so much space, and monsters were a constant threat to help section the ebbs and flows of the world. At times, even the term “monster” was a subject of debate alongside many other terms in science and among scholars and philosophers.\nIf someone wanted to become everything, they might have to stare at the people and know their enemy and then themselves. In line with this ambitious tone, a big ego could work in some cases, but sustaining positive relationships and collaboration might become challenging if the ego was excessive and led to a lack of consideration toward others.\nAt the moment, a group of monsters were in the state of traveling nearby: a monster in the form of a chest on four spider-like legs, and two humanoid demons.\nThey were in the middle of a conversation, using playful slang like “doglist!”, “natanya!”, and “shinies!”.\nThe goblins knew that they had to go in the day where monsters burned in the sunlight, because the night would spawn monsters.\nBut the aforementioned group of monsters were walking in the day, having learned passive skills to prevent them from burning.\nNearby, one of the monsters who survived throughout the morning since last night, a skeleton aimed at these monsters from under a shade.\nThe spider-like chest threw out an emerging tentacle, stabbing the skeleton through the head, as the two demons discussed briefly.\nSeveral goblins got up on a tree and aimed at the chest, but the fireballs fell from the sky toward this tree, causing the goblins to retreat.\nThese fireballs came from one of the humanoid demons.\nSeeing the other demon running up with fists raised, the goblins regrouped with the rest of the thousand.\nBut this demon chased them aggressively, so the goblins shot at her with bows and arrows, some throwing javelins that struck her in the head. Instead of wasting their projectiles on one demon, they threw several volleys, checking for life each time. On the third volley, the demon fell to the ground, dead.\nThe demon fell to the ground, and her back lay against the earth.\nThe remaining demon and spider-like chest retreated quietly.\nChapter 19 - Entwined Fates in the Dungeon: Goldberg’s Resolve linkBack in the city, a group of humans sighted these monsters and made greetings with the goblins. Rather than adventurers, they were protégés who relied on the patronage of nobles, having unique job labels that earned their commitment. Their jobs included a researcher-detective, a skillful pike-maker, a missionary-chaplain, and a well-equipped swordsman-crossbowman, among others. With magic and nobles’ support, trailblazers like these could bear fruit. This was similar to noble-backed writers and artists in the cultural and intellectual realms.\nThough, it was strange that they were here, but it was strange that goblins were traveling at all. They were going to involve themselvse in a plethora of risks and minimal short-term rewards, banking everything on long-term development. This was the same for the group of protégés, who were making their way to the city to check out what was going on there before night came. They heard about the large gathering of different adventurers there after the goblin attack. They were a little late to the party, but they had their own timetables.\nSo now that they were here, they were going to touch hands with the soldiers of several outposts, giving them news of the attack at a harbor. This was doing a favor for the soldiers letting them come by at all. Often times, the city was pretty strict with the inflow of travelers. So it was nice to see a human being so helpful and accommodating despite the grueling work and staying on their toes, attending the monsters that spawned every night.\nMeanwhile, the only force curbing, alleviating, and containing the monsters was the adventurers. Nonetheless, with the city showing interest in budget adjustments in the adventurer industry, the avenues of expanding rapidly, investing in research and development, and exploring new markets could shift off the table. This meant that the aggressive growth of safety through all these avenues might lose its fervor.\nAny change introduced a relatively short span of instability, but the thinking was that the rewards were permanent. So, even nobles who might benefit off the status quo were exhausted of monotony. This was why opportunities like getting a patronage existed, because if society stayed stagnant, it would end up worse in the long run. If one wasn’t growing, one was losing. So adventurers were just one of those things that lawmakers and the king had several interests: decreasing their influence from talks, including representatives from different industries like mining, and consulting with adventurers, businesses, and stakeholders to ensure a well-managed transition, among others.\nInstead, the government was hoping to implement new strategies and labels moving forward in order to transition away from adventurers’ problematic history and into a fresh start. They wanted one they could manage without dealing with misunderstandings due to the historical memory regarding adventurers. Indeed, censorship and propaganda went a long way into creating and maintaining an iconic image of the adventurers as strong and charismatic leaders. Nevertheless, political instability through interconnected elements such as the goblin attacks, fatal incidents, and the politically motivated killing of civilians by adventurers impinged upon this image. Moreover, the government was starting to feel an irk toward how powerful the adventurer industry and biting heads, or industry leaders, had become. To conclude, adventurers were expensive to maintain with all the tax incentives, similar to stream of funding toward mobilized troops during geopolitical tension.\nIt was not a simple “government does everything like a hive mind” thing, since magic made it so that various roles could bridge functional gaps and enable coordination between much more people, making it so that the balance of power was not shared between a very small portion of society.\nSo internally, the government was changing and dynamic. But so was the adventurers, goblins, humans, nobles’ followers, protégés, and their relationships with each other.\nIn the end, playing a game of chess was easy, so the players of the world played, forgoing the interests of different talking heads of society. But a game was merely a simulation of more complex mechanics that the world already provided. It was never-ending, ever-inviting fertile ground for research.\nThe roof of knowledge had to get higher, because it was getting cramped with all the bodies.\nThe burden of ancient and recent history weighed on normal people like Charles Finch. But the world was this giant, dark forest into the everlasting. The sagely might venture forth into it, the immortals might find out everything about it, and, even then, it would still be full of factors absent from their minds.\nMeanwhile, Charles and Sarah laughed at a joke Mary made, watching Elizabeth making a funny walk. They didn’t know everything, but they were happy now. They were living here and now, and if something was hard, they would keep going. It was not easy, but that was their souls’ desire. If they wanted to lose everything, they could. But they would keep going. It was just that simple.\nIn the meantime, in a dungeon, an adventurer, Goldberg, lay against the earth, slightly trembling, exhausted to the point that he couldn’t move much. A fire burned inside him. “No, it’s just not right,” he said with effort. “We cannot just let them die. We must do something about it.” Incarceration helped him reflect, and now, instead of thinking only about becoming himself in a society, he wanted to escape and help fellow adventurers again. The comfort that fellow adventurers gave him only gained precedence in his mind now when he lacked it. He wanted to help them live better lives, and he hoped it extended toward society. Society was the only reason he wasn’t imprisoned in a dungeon like he was now. It empowered him and made him feel like a human being. Now, he felt like nothing.\n“It’s just not right.”\nHalf a distance away, one of two goblins, Kahul, on whom Goldberg relied to live, eyed him with newfound clarity, sitting with his side to Goldberg. “So that’s your problem.” They were outside at the dungeon entrance behind bars that blocked monsters and Goldberg from passing.\n“What would someone do to get on your side?” Goldberg said.\n“You’re asking the wrong question,” Kahul said, emphasizing “You’re”.\n“Okay. What would someone do to be your friend?” Goldberg glanced at the other goblin next to the one he was talking to.\n“Gemstone for storing information.” Kahul wanted this, among others.\nGoldberg felt his ambition, along with nervousness, the fear of death, jittery excitement, and obsession, flare up again. He suddenly remembered who he was now that he saw an opportunity. He was not going to pretend and be enslaved by the powers. He would not allow his oppressors to rope him into submission. He was not their pet.\nHe would smirk in the face of the powers, guffawing suddenly.\nWith a careful back-and-forth with some tense moments, he would convince Kahul that he would help him and the goblins, allowing him to leave as part of a goblin regiment comprising of Kahul and the goblin next to him, among hundreds of others.\nThey were more than adventurers: the goblin government would support them moving forward.\nIt was night, hours away from day 20, so the back-and-forth would end on day 26.\nBut now, Goldberg would be situated in the dungeon, where many monsters entered after spawning in the nighttime.\nSocially, monsters were not just a mass of insects, but even insects had a complex social environment and nutritional strategy. Significantly, generalizing monsters would continue to take lives. Still, adventurers generalized with trolls, thinking that these monsters were merely just attacking entities. Ultimately, the real fight was in understanding how they behaved in their everyday beyond just observing their minimally spent wartime states.\nBut the glory of war often blinded people from recognizing the engineers, systems, and preparations behind the magic of society. Instead, people relied on talking heads to determine the complexities for them, often getting entangled in censorship and propaganda. It was a game of pretend.\nSociety needed pretending in order for structure to form—collectively agreed-upon fictions that contributed to social cohesion.\nYet, it was the scholars and researchers to delve deeper into what defined the norm and whether certain common terms were sufficient or needed further context and explanation. Some terms from unsubstantiated theories had to be discarded. New terms emerged to describe things that didn’t have words or required too many words to identify.\nSo, if anything, Goldberg would be facing both the known and unknown.\nHe could lose his life any day now. No one could tell.\nThis was why he was nervous, as everyone would be. Even those who had heavily invested their entire ego on societal structures that were on the verge of becoming obsolete would, one day, have to face dread or anxiety. The future was now in the shaking and the pressing on.\nBut oh was he so sure that he was going to have to become everything. He was not letting anyone decide for him what he was or who he was.\nHe was him. He would not stop now or ever.\nIf anyone dared treat him as if he was nothing or something to be dismissed, he would make it clear through just a simple glance that he was everything there was.\nNo one would decide that for him. No one.\nIf anyone was going to rally around someone, it would be him, because he would show the world what a human being meant. It was worth, it mattered, and it was entirely individual.\nHe would crush this society and everything it stood for if it dared tell me a word, the kind that pretended that they grasped his true nature. They were mocking him if that was the case. He would not allow that. Not a single chance.\nHe would mock and laugh at them. He would do it.\nThat was who he was, and he could pretend all he wanted. But the truth was that if anyone mattered, he would prove it.\nBut he was also a committed father and husband, born and raised in a tight-knit society full of social enforcements, silence treatments, and manipulative gossiping. If people reported that he was not a human being and called him a monster or something horrible, he would laugh at them. Those who advocated for peace and acceptance dared treat him, who was a human being like them, as something that isn’t human, normal, or acceptable. They didn’t recognize how evil humans like them could really be. Every time he heard them confidently state that they deserved a paradise in a self-righteous manner, he found this amusing and pointed out the hilarity in their statements.\nEven with all this, he made lots of friends by focusing on the positives rather than the negatives of others. This was because he was skilled at postponing his furious hatred of disabling the individual. He and his siblings grew up in an environment that emphasized excellence, and their parents rewarded them accordingly. However, singling out and isolation accompanied this, making them individuals in the most disabling way possible. So he was done with this attitude. Because of the great contrast in his experience with the disabling of people as individuals, he wanted to empower the individual. In the end, he remembered how his parents often emphasized him as an epitome of excellence to his siblings.\nThis memory made him feel enraged because of the humiliation he underwent through empathizing with his siblings’ helplessness in this dynamic, even if he was the one labeled the winner.\nHe would become everything, taking on the mantle of winner in order to tell the world that they mattered as human beings individually.\nIt was because of his siblings that he learned to be kind and sociable, but the rage and ambition remained, intertwined with his empathy. He would brutally murder callousness and inhumanity to show the world that a human being, their life, memories, experiences, influences, knowledge, and skills, mattered. It was only logical.\nBut these were his ideals. His real self was ever-short of them, so with this understanding, his face twitched with frustration.\nReturning to the moment, Goldberg carefully continued deeper into the dungeon, knowing that he had limits. If he went into a chamber full of monsters, he could die. He didn’t need to go too deep into the dungeon, but if he stayed near the entrance for too long, that would be fatal. As for the reason of this, if the monsters learned he was there, they might mobilize and attack him strategically.\nBut what he didn’t expect was the presence of six other human prisoners. He was not familiar with goblins’ social environment, so he didn’t know what they did with prisons. He didn’t even consider his imprisonment as he would if he was in a prison by humans. He had little opinion of them, because he only saw them as annoying monsters in the wild. So he didn’t think that other people would be in the dungeon. Now that he saw this, he was not sure what to feel about goblins, leaving him hesitant regarding the human prisoners who were here before he was. If he wanted to win in a fight, he had to know what he was fighting. Dealing with humans was not something he ever did in his life. He was protected by the laws of human society. Here, he might not be safe at all. He might even die at the hands of humans whom he protected for years. He could only try to initiate a conversation as he would normally.\nHis decision-making happened within a span of five seconds, reflecting his expertise in dealing with fast-paced, life-threatening situations.\nSince he and the other prisoners identified each other’s presence, Goldberg called out before they could to show dominance at least in speed: “Hi!” This could be interpreted in various ways, some of which could be rewarding. Though, he could have chosen to be silent as an alternative.\nChapter 20 - The Dynamics of Captivity link“Who are you!” said one of the prisoners, Bean, gesturing to the other prisoners to focus on a game.\n“Goldberg, an adventurer!” Goldberg said as the prisoners ran around, making loud footsteps and exclaiming.\n“Why are you here for!” said Bean word-by-word because he was dashing.\n“I was patrolling down a path near the bridge before the goblins cast a spell on me that made me lose my senses!” said Goldberg, slowing down at certain parts when he felt that their footsteps and exclaimations would outshout him.\n“How did that happen, you wager!” said Bean as he picked up several meaningful glances from the other prisoners.\n“I’ve no clue!” Goldberg pretended to look down, decreasing his field of view, but he was actually fishing for predatory instincts from them. “I’m just here now.”\n“Okay then!” Bean studied Goldberg’s athletic and wide-shouldered physical build. “Guys, let’s do another round!” He and the other prisoners were playing a game called “pantintero,” which was played on a rectangular grid drawn on the ground. Since they were 6 players, they could play with a 3-vs.-3 matchup.\nGoldberg was confused, but he took the route he always did with people: “Can I join you guys!”\nIn the end, his options reflected his personality here rather than understanding. As for why this was the case, in this situation, the long-term prisoners could be anyone and prefer an approach outside of his expectations and his past knowledge. People were too random to be construed consistently without tailoring to each individual.\nEach of Bean’s fellow prisoners were named Catherine, Samuel, Joseph, Benjamin, and William.\nConsidering that five of them were men and only one of them was a woman, the dynamics likely would have been horrible if it was not for the fact that Catherine was still a young girl. This made the men very protective and affectionate for her needs as that of a child. In brief, she brought out the fatherly side of them.\nGoldberg was confused about this dynamic, but he didn’t let it show.\nCatherine’s presence there meant that the goblins consciously imprisoned her with the men. The goblins were strangely considerate by imprisoning her rather than killing or enslaving her. But it was still weird that they put her with the men. The fact that the men had a soft spot for children was fortunate.\nGoldberg was lucky that the dynamics among the prisoners were peaceful due to a central peacekeeping force, Catherine. In the end, Catherine, similar to pets in a prison, passively settled the tensions of the group and brought out the childishness from them in the form of children’s games like pantintero.\nAt the moment, Goldberg was allowed to participate in this game.\nLater, Goldberg wanted to break the tension bubbling up and warning of an explosion. So he made a half-joke: “Ha, if we just did this, maybe I could stay here forever.”\nThe prisoners glanced at Goldberg then at Catherine. “No, she must return to her family,” said Samuel.\n“She deserves a proper life,” said Joseph.\n“We have resolved to provide her that,” said Benjamin.\nWilliam looked determined in his bearing, while Bean smirked. These implied their agreement with the rest.\nAfter a short pause, Goldberg nodded suddenly with pleasant surprise.\nIn the front of his mind, he thought this situation was fricked up, and he yearned to get back to normal society. He needed proper, organized, and simple adventurer quests, not this horrible dungeon.\nHe felt that the prisoners would kill him at any moment, or anything could happen since he and the prisoners were under the control of goblins, whom he knew little about outside of battle.\nThis situation was hell.\nHe wanted to keep asking questions. So he asked them his first: “How did you all end up in this dungeon?”\n“We were heading south to Jackman City,” said Bean, removing himself from a round of pantintero, “but we came to a stop after seeing a group of people blocking and controlling a road. We got to pass after a short discussion about news, but goblins came and took us by surprise, dragging us to the caves. And now, after five months, we’re waiting for a response from people.”\n“Do the goblins often imprison humans here, or is this a unique situation?”\n“We don’t know,” said Samuel, exiting the pantintero round.\n“What do you know about the goblins and their motives for keeping us here?” said Goldberg.\n“We have no idea,” said Bean, leaving the game.\n“Have you encountered other adventurers in this dungeon before?”\n“We saw one adventurer, but he was deranged. So we had to let him know in a possibly… lethal way.”\nGoldberg shifted gears from his prepared questions: “Might I ask who’s this adventurer?”\nThe other prisoners still playing pantintero cocked their heads and began to stare at Goldberg tensely.\n“Hey,” Benjamin told Goldberg, gesturing to the other prisoners. “I just want to say that we also don’t know about that. Can we talk about this some other time?”\nFeeling unfulfilled, he had more than 20 questions remaining, but Goldberg resigned and nodded with thanks, feeling rewarded anyway for his efforts and grateful for the prisoners’ patience. To Goldberg, these questions were like a chance to find out the history behind a gigantic, black, cylindrical tower that had been in the middle of the wilderness for over 2,200 years.\nIn conclusion, he was encumbered by both his damp padded gambeson and this sudden prison.\nEven after everything, he would pull the seams of this earth and hurl them down to the ground. Every moment was tied to this goal of his. He was no martyr, no god, no devil. But he was a human being, and his might extended across all the shadows of the earth. He would not be tied, repelled, or treated like a lost cause. He would become the epitome of all things.\nThe next day, in the morning, a breeze from a lake touched goblins’ and humans’ shaded hangout spots and their thatched stilt houses.\nMeanwhile, at a market back in the city, Billy imagined several thousand giants sitting down on the buildings, wishing that he could be as tall as them because that would be interesting rather than just cool. His curiosity was starting to get more sophisticated, as a traumatic incident involving him and fellow friends forced him to mature faster.\nNext to him, Nathan, Robert, Shadrach, and Notch, 7 other boys, and 2 women tried to have a discussion, but it was challenging, since they were still teenagers with little clue about the world. Their trauma only made them more desperate to connect and find coherence with each other. If they could clarify their issues to each other, maybe they would find the answers they were looking for. They were ignorant about every other event that went on while they tried to cope with their struggles. This meant that they were idle, yet they were productive because they reflected on broader questions and observations that they wouldn’t have considered if the incident didn’t happen. This was a fresh start for them, and they were hoping to make things right.\nIf they avoided involving themselves with larger issues, they would be less likely to have problems. This could be attributed to their cohesive group dynamic, as opposed to an individual standing alone. They wanted to return to daily life, but it was a struggle due to deep shift in their mindset. With willfully obtained experience and knowledge came the struggle to be content with what used to be normal.\nThey couldn’t pretend to see things as they used to. They could only slowly accept their circumstances. This could be facilitated through their sustained interactions with each other as a group that went through the same trauma.\nThey decided to form an adventurer group, ignorant of the political issues besetting it and setting a cooldown delay on relations with Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair.\nThey were tired of being strung along. Behind this, Nathan, the former apprentice miner most against Leroy, orchestrated the group and their current meeting today. It was he who guilted the unapologetic Leroy for the aforementioned incident that left tens of children dead.\nAt the moment, they started to count the items in stalls with their fingers, keeping their dominant hands in front of their face, as they traveled through the market.\nAs soon as they went through the most congested area and satisfied their curiosity, notably with Shadrach and one of the two women taking notes, they split into smaller units. Their objective was to avoid over-attending smaller subsets of stalls and instead optimize their course through involving only as much as needed. Their exemplary organization could be attributed to their history with their Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair.\nBut the organization of this teenage group was in no way comparable to the struggles of adventurer groups in their pursuit of success. These groups could be receiving challenging but very rewarding quests left and right, but after their short-lived success, they returned to the life of just meager, time-wasting tasks. It was battle for reputation, so often times, adventurers presented themselves as individuals rather than as part of the adventurer industry as a hivemind. But as mentioned earlier, adventurers were changing, consolidating under larger factions and groups for better structure and more inclusiveness. But this had potential drawbacks: internal strife, red tape, loss of individuality, elitism, and political instability.\nYet, it was fair to praise the teenage group for doing well after what they went through as human beings.\nReturning to their market strategy, since Billy’s parents were market vendors, they could easily obtain information from his parents, but they were curious to perceive it as it appeared to them first. This way, his parents’ insight would be an ameliorative layer to their untainted perceptions, especially if issues occurred during their first run-through. Ultimately, this would lead to a more comprehensive grasp of the complexities of the market.\nAfter they finished, they received a reward in the form of notepads of information. It was small, but they would keep going. Resources were dwindling, and time was running out. Their efforts were only a small blot on this earth, but it was sufficient for now. They would not be stopped.\nThe world was moving so slowly, as it had only been 20 days since Billy, Shadrach, and Notch met Maverick. Yet, they and the rest of the teenage group went through several lifetimes together and learned so much, becoming so much more confident about taking risks and trying new things.\nIf it was not for Maverick, Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair, and Millie and the rest of the other former apprentice miners who had lost their lives in the incident, they would not be here.\nIt was natural to visit friends who passed away, so they decided that today would be a good day to visit the place where Maverick died, Northe Road.\nOne of the benefits of the past influx of numerous adventurers in response to a goblin attack that involved the boys was playing a minor role in the city’s response of building barriers, which continued to this day. So the three boys could safely use Northe Road.\n“Nakakainis naman ito,” said a small boy nearby, expressing frustration at a magical gemstone.\nIn the distance, several families were competing over a ring. It was a civil argument, and magic determined the winner. Since these families were relatively wealthy freemen, they could expend a considerable budget toward basic magic education and empowerment through certain resources like gemstones.\nThe families were four, and each of them sent out 3 teenagers. These teenagers could decide the limitations of the magic, but their limitations had to be central to “fairness and equity”, as the families expressed through the written principles.\nAnyway, the limitations were mostly just using “honorable” methods such as giving each opponent a turn at attacking. So they had a turn-based matchup rather than a typical fight.\nMeanwhile, farther in the distance, several adventurer groups were having many discussions within them, but the wind and distance provided them privacy.\n“You sound like a great guy, man. I love it. Can we talk about your job? Or your things you know? I would love to see someone who’s that crazy for everything, you know. Everything about this entire operation sounds like an entire waste of money. But still, it still is effective, don’t you think?”\n“What would they think? I want to talk to them again. Honestly, I wish they knew what I felt. I would wake up in the morning and think what the hell am I doing. It’s a frequent, occuring thing, you know. This endless un-removable feeling of “I hate this all of this!” You know what I mean. This is everything, and I’ve lost it all. I—hehehe—I just don’t know.”\n“It’s just a crazy world that I have no clue about, and if I could, I would just finish everything and not have to deal with anything. It’s funny that I even think about anything. All these thoughts in my head. It doesn’t go away. I remember what it was like to be a human being, and now I just feel like this is the weirdest thing I’ve ever done. I think I’m done…”\n“So this is how you do it. You place down the little dropper thing, and after that, you get this small explosion. That’s fine. You want that. Now, as long as you do what it says, you’ll be good, okay?”\nThe discussions were helpful in many ways. One, they fine-tuned a sense of belonging, shared experience, and structure. Two, they served as a mechanism for providing emotional, informational, and instrumental support. Three, they reinforced cultural values. Four, they played a crucial role in the socialization and symbolic alignment and construction process, because without them, words, facial expressions, tone, body language, and other non-verbal cues would lose their meaning as culture evolved, trasmitting new layers of nuance behind these expressions.\nThrough discussion and, by extension, their collaboration, the adventurers were becoming human beings in the contextual, cognitive, emotional, interpersonal, and physical realms.\nIn other words, their humanity was growing. This was analogous to the melding of various raw metals each with different atomic compositions, creating an even stronger alloy due to how these compositions combined diversely for optimal comprehensiveness.\nWhether an adventurer struggled with a disability, went through trauma growing up, were uneducated and born too poor to develop fairly, lived a “normal” or happy life, had parents growing up, grew in a wealthy paradise where they could freely express themselves through virtually unlimited mediums, their perspective as a human being, which ranged from the past in memory, to the present in communication, and to the future in potential, was value in and of itself. Using magic to find a cure for diseases, to aid communication, and help spread awareness of the human being behind them would procure the overflow of this value for the finest rewards. Instead of a moral good, it essentialized a practical one. To be more specific, this mended the framework that relied on the idea that the artist should only paint what artists should paint, the writer speak of the experience of a writer, and the scholar talk only about science without considering how best to equip the individual with this knowledge. If people were given more ways to express their unique selves, communication would freely develop into more integrative and interactive structures of thought. Moreover, creative and innovate problem-solving would enlarge the range in which a society develops, rather than only relying on one industry and developing in an askew manner. This manner would be like a man without a right leg, two arms, eyes, a nose, and right foot and only relying on the bubbly sense that the left leg was intrinsic so as to omit any other distinct organs or appendages of the human body.\nBasically, humanity relied on different functions or roles, the cultural heritage of various regions, and different social structures. Similarly, Big Brain constituted many functions, regions, and structures.\nSo since Billy, Shadrach, and Notch wanted to rule the world and had the chance to do so, they would need to know what the hell a dog was. More than what it was to them, they needed to know what it meant to everyone else. Indeed, this went the same for magic.\nRather than one-size-fits-all, Magic was, like art, a matter of expression. Everyone knew all the right ways to do it their respective ways, but it was up to the individual to decide what they wanted philsophically, emotionally, mentally, ideally, and all the different aspects of a human being, which all interacted with how a person tramitted their magic.\nA brute could make magic through rage. Did that mean rage was the solution? Yes and no. If it worked for one, it could work for some, but it would not work for all, particularly since everyone interpreted and expressed rage differently.\nSo magic would kill a person, but it would come from another human being capable of all of that unique assortment of complexity. This was why murder was an act of complexity obliterating complexity—value obliterating value.\nIn sum, Billy, Shadrach, and Notch had a long journey if being interesting, to them, was ruling the world or something.\nChapter 21 - The Burden of Nobility linkMeanwhile, the three boys returned where they lived.\n“Wee!” said Billy as he ran around. “I am speed!” He was eighteen years old, but he let himself relax and put on a playful side from time to time. If he was perpetually serious and silent when he didn’t need to be, he would be exhausted more often than not. So at his age, he merely weaponized that side of himself, making it a habit so that he could just do it on the go without thinking about it much. This was the side of himself that managed to grow up to eighteen years old, so it was empirically more effective.\nMindfully present rather than writing in a notebook, Shadrach chuckled, as Billy passed him.\nNotch was just sitting on his haunches, staring at the clouds.\nRather than only having each other, they each had many friends and families.\nThe problem was that their families were also a big thing.\nSpeaking of families, meanwhile, John Roger was handling papers and looking over several names on a list of papers magically created. Since he was a noble, fetching reports on various different subjects was customary. This was distinct from reading tomes, scrolls, or books, as these reports were relevantly discussing the fluctuations of magical behavior. “Magical behavior” referred to the ways people used magic, managed it, what spells they used, with which artifacts they augmented their magic, and how they achieved their goals using magic individually, and how they expressed themselves through their magic, and how they got their magic, among others.\nHe learned that people were returning to a category of thought called “essentialism,” which was the use of magic through enhancing menial work. Rather than using terms that faded away rapidly, experts used them because they helped elucidate the various grand benefits and consequences of magic on everyday people. In way, as a broader discipline, essentialism was a reintegration of diverse magical sub-disciplines. Shifting to one of these sub-disciplines, “ecologism,” how people typically did it in culture, embraced identification and affiliation with each tree in the forest, placing an appreciative sign with an endearing name and description. However, it was more than giving each tree a place in society, as it was about what it was a part of as a whole: a focus on respecting magically the dynamics and identities of each vegetation of the enironment rather than oversimplifying them to a singular metric like lumber and pasture. In the end, behavior was shifting away from ecologism toward the broader essentalism, even if they might engage in actions aligning with ecologist thought occasionally.\nReturning to overall magical behavior, since people weren’t purely rational, their magical behavior could be similarly unpredictable. Moreover, everything written on magical behavior merely hailed from its properties as a social science and a school of thought rather than a strong emphasis on objectivity and empiricism such as that of hard sciences.\nAs a consequence of the subjectivity of magical behavior and behavior in general, the elaborate perspective of John Roger on society was shaped by his unique lens.\nSpeaking of unique lens, people like John Roger behaved as individuals within a larger society rather than watery masses of growing flesh that only sought the path of least resistance.\nSo reports allowed nobles to be aware of changes and hopefully help them make better decisions regarding regulations and such. This would prevent sudden surges of magic in a specific area, potentially leading to full-blown chaos. Two people might feel themselves empowered due to the increased attention in the magic they specialized in. Then, they might unleash their rage upon each other, impinging upon the behavior of those within the vicinity. This could lead to riots, and since people naturally felt uncomfortable with compromising, the righteousness of rage was a delicacy.\nEven if powerful magic was hard to get, even basic magic was easily tied to the ego than a knife, making it much more readily acceptable as a form of communication, albeit possibly violent. Moreover, magic was often more immediate than money, making it the hardest to regulate with due process. This meant many people with hidden magic were everywhere. Furthermore, these would often involve getting away with more than just petty crime: blackmail and summary executions, among others. In conclusion, all of this tied back to the tense relationship betweeen adventurers internally and between adventurers and the government. There existed a future where vigilantes and terrorists walked around in broad daylight, thinking they were heroes, when they were merely one of a plethora of organizations who thought the same. Rather than organizations, they called themselves brothers, comrades, friends, and family. Propaganda did much to hide the true nature of their heroisms as the exploitation of the weak. An incident involving a goblin killing a group of women would “confirm” past accusations against goblins as a whole, contributing to them being the target of ethnic cleansing. The beauty of evil was that it was the only thing stopping people from due process and the process of science, which sought to refine itself over time through discarding unsubstantiated theories that promoted division and war.\nEven the commonly accepted idea of goblins as disgusting and evil was a manifestation of propaganda that clawed its way into lore, legends, and historical memory, using them as scapegoats or attention-grabbers away from broader hard-to-address issues. If one could believe goblins were only disgusting, one could believe any group of individuals was similarly so. Manipulable social constructs sounded good because they sounded like truths that were and continued to be. But some things only emerged a decade ago. For people born after this, they would believe it as those around them said it, taking sometimes decades to ponder confusedly the question: “What is a dog?”\nThis was why John Roger was keen as every other noble was, since they were all shaped by their fathers and mothers to be privy to a profusion of knowledge that peasants and freemen would likely never see.\nIt was the balance of life. Nobles dealt with broader issues, while everyone else dealt with their own.\nIn the end, he despised his world, wishing to live among the people. If he could be an individual rather than a person concerned with everyone, he would be able to be free.\nEven as a child, he was never given time to play and socialize normally, always being forced to learn complex subjects. Naturally, this left him underdeveloped in empathy and social, communication, and conflict resolution skills. As a result, he began relying on his power as a noble to avoid situations involving a healthy counterpart of these abilities. So even if he knew adventurers were problematic, having killed thousands of civilian goblins in the past, he didn’t want to deal with it.\nSo he would become an adventurer one day he hoped. His intention was to be free.\nBut despite his strong grasp on society from a formal level, he was unaware of four aspects.\nOne, a new life as a free adventurer could lead him to learn what it meant to be an individual in a society full of other individuals and develop empathy, which was a fundamental component of understanding people.\nTwo, despite his heavy conceptual and abstract knowledge, he lacked the real-world experiences to understand them, only memorizing terms and seeing patterns that only mattered when they were applied to firsthand experiences that he lacked. These experiences would be part of many different aspects of the real outside world: communities full of different kinds of people and dynamics; traveling and getting to know over a thousand kindhearted people; growing up with relatively supportive parents; learning personally a set of skills; a multifaceted proficiency in fitness; and spending years reflecting, studying, and communicating past experiences and knowledge; among countless others.\nThree, his formative learning environment was so controlled and isolated from everyday life that he became good at obeying and being uncreative.\nFour, his desire to be free out there was more than just a whim. His brain begged him to touch grass.\nHe was trapped, but he was showing more of his internalized desperation. He was expending his followers’ time impulsively to attend to his new proxy adventurer, Charles Finch. He had seventy of these proxies already, but they accidentally killed off three identified laborers, excluding Maverick, over the course of three months. Now, he was testing Charles Finch by having him deal with a dungeon core, which would take three weeks. Overall, he expedited his exit, or the idea of it at least, through the proxies.\nFrom an economic standpoint, the three deaths were negative externalities, as his business passion for hiring proxy adventurers resulted in them.\nIn any case, he wanted to get out as quickly as possible, so he hoped that one day, he might overpower the nobles by finding a magical artifact that might empower him. Though, this magical artifact and overthrowing the government event only happened once a century ago. So, he had many other options that were similarly unlikely.\nBut he had to try something.\nIt was like he would destroy the entire world just to pet a cat for the first time like a curious, innocent child.\nHe never really grew up.\nSo he wanted to be free to experience a fulfilling life, or he could die trying.\nAt the moment, now that he read the report part of the papers, he immediately signed several of these papers, on which proposals, contracts, and agreements were presented.\nHe had to be quick, since the market, including adventurer behavior and overall financial behavior, was shifting rapidly. If he was slow to make decisions, the expected resources he signed to be bought would continue to undergo inflation due to the adventurers’ increasingly high buying power in comparison to other industries like mining. Since he was a part of the government himself, he knew that it was inevitable that the nobles would soon agree on budget adjusments for the adventurers. But he had faith that the adventurers would locate a lucrative dungeon source, maybe even a portal to hell, in time.\nIt was like he was playing a violin skillfully, and he couldn’t make a mistake. Or he might lose everything, the momentum he was building to unleash his great wish upon the earth.\nHe didn’t chuckle; instead, he guffawed manically, knowing so much yet knowing so little. His helplessness made him so joyous. It was the anxiety that left him crawling for salvation. It was this excitement that brought him to life. He was alive, but he felt that he would only be alive if he truly made the results to get out of here.\nHe was so close, and he couldn’t call his mother or his father. He could call one word: “Freedom.”\nHe was sure that he was likely going to lose everything, he could die anytime, and he felt helpless his entire life to achieve the goals he believed in.\nYet, he couldn’t help but laugh. It was too perfect. He was perfection. Tears dripped down his face, as a sense of weakness overcame him.\n“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” He began to bawl.\nHis grandiosity and his grief were one and the same. He lost something he never had but he deserved—waking up in the morning and seeing the sun without thinking that he was going to lose everything.\n“It’s just not enough. This is not it.”\n“It can’t be.” Anger broke out from him, his face an art piece of hatred. “It just can’t be!”\nHe would become the epitome of grace and beauty.\nHe would become everything.\nHe would kill to give life to a lamb.\nA burst into aggrieved laughter twisted out of him.\nHe kept repeating the same emotional movements of laughter, grief, grandiosity, guilt and loss, and anger, growing more subdued as time passed.\nWhen he was finally done, he returned to calm seriousness. “I’m just tired,” he said even though he did this once a month or so. “I’m just pretending.\n“I’m making it up.\n“It doesn’t really matter.”\nNow, he was back to swift work, his productive side and his emotional one compartmentalized effectively. This could be attributed to how nobles learned defensively to put on airs not just with peasants, freemen, and their followers but also with their fellows. This putting on airs made them easier to hate, but nobles could only be what the world told them they were or were supposed to be. If they failed to meet perceived expectations or standards, they felt and were treated worse off.\nBut it was all black and white. Nobles deserved to die if they weren’t perfection.\nPerfection or nothing.\nPerfection or annihilation.\nPerfection or complete destruction or obliteration.\nWhat was normal to freemen was infinitely harder to nobles, and what were nobles’ job was infinitely harder to freemen. If freemen wanted something from nobles, they would have to take into account that nobles lived very different lives, so their skill set would not always fit expectations of norm, notably when the world was so much more complex than what freemen thought. The more one knew, the more one realized they didn’t know. Freemen felt they knew all the right ways to go about doing things if they were a noble, but if they really did become nobles, they would then learn that they didn’t know anything at all.\nThe worse part was that knowledge was still limited, and nobles could only know so much before they reached the ceiling of accumulated knowledge. Moreover, even if nobles had so many books to understand the world and how to solve the millions of issues that make up even just one broader issue, mastering all the information and application would require more than what one noble could handle, even with all the money. In the end, most freemen thought that books were not really that useful, since they preferred practical knowledge. But books that took months to read were practical knowledge. Nobles would spent their life learning one subject and then discover that they did not know a single thing after all. All the greatest developments would happen centuries later, yet they didn’t know a thing at all. They lived in a world full of unknowns, so even with all the books available, it was like living in a maze for one’s entire life. They were stuck, and they could only try to understand things. Improving the systems such as the mining industry that contributed to the circulation of money was important. Money was not a solve-it-all, since it could be used cost-ineffectively. It was combined money and knowledge that led to growth. So instead of letting one freeman with little formal and informal education on plants decide what to do with society, which included what to do with trees and plants, it was better to let people educated on plants to handle societal planning in the realm of plants.\nHowever, nobles had potential to engage in corrupt practices all the time. Bureacracy was good for checks and balances. Notwithstanding, corruption could slip between the processes. All in all, the king consolidated power and made it harder for corruption to take place, making his potential for abuse the greatest.\nThe king of the nation-state that comprised the city, various other cities, districts, towns, and settlements. Despite that, at this time, the term “district” could refer to a part of a city or town. All thing considered, language evolved overtime.\nIn spite of everything, the adventurer name John Roger wanted was “The Sickle”, partly inspired by Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair’s miners.\nFrom a door nearby, a group including his followers entered the room, smiling at him.\nHe smiled at them. With their help, he tried his best to maintain his work and study and stay afloat on trends.\nEven in the hardest times, there would always be moments worth living for.\nAlongside the followers, a group of adventurers stood, their faces those of an older walker looking for hope.\nThe adventurers numbered 70, and they sat on the floor or squatted down in the hallway, at the door, and somewhat inside the room. Each of them\nShifting to a symbolic level, John Roger internalized his great fist, and he would use the adventurers to his ends. It was up to the adventurers to defeat this symbol of authority and become ever more grandiose than him.\nAt the moment, they gave each other an introductory stare. Simultaneously, the discussion of the followers danced behind the scenes.\nIn reality, it was nothing really. They were looking at each other in a friendly manner. The adventurers shook hands with John and vice versa. It was a nice simple moment.\nThe followers even thought this would be the easiest time for a collaborative process between them and John Roger with the objective of bringing the adventurers up to date.\nJohn Roger was tired. If he only played military tactics, then maybe his life would be much more easier. It was the details, people, and nobles that troubled him. Yet, he had a dream, and he was tired of the ways people argued, backstabbed, and looked for sensational perspectives.\nOne of the things he hated were people without a conviction: people who cheated and lied their way through life instead of facing their fears and staring at what scared them the most. He hated people who didn’t have a beating soul; instead, they constantly looked for ways to convince themselves rather than going out there and doing something honest for once, especially if it involved feelings of humiliation, helplessness, and vulnerability. Standing up for what one believed in and having a strong enough moral integrity to die for one’s beliefs was an essential aspect of John Roger. He was tired of hypocrisy, which was why he wanted to achieve his goals. He remembered again his goals, his commitment, and his mindset, so he wanted to exert the power that he had instead of waiting helplessly for help. This time, he would do something about the issues he saw instead of engaging in empty rhetoric or denial.\nBefore his fellow nobles could oust him, he planned to withhold information from the nobles handling domestic intelligence and security. This gate was part of an international network that connected nations across regions, and he was a noble who was part of a service that handled foreign—basically international—intelligence. His objective was to bring in militants from another nation, and the gate merely made this easier. The militants would go through another way, but having his responsibility be on repairing this gate made this smoother. The militants’ attack would occur after the adventurers in front of him blocked off the dungeons that supplied the city with resources.\nFor most of the adventurers, he was doing this for a greater purpose, but he was just tired of being stuck in the noble life. So he had to do something about it.\nBut this would need preparation over the course of several years. He needed to be patient regarding the timing, and he needed to keep amassing forces. It was bound to happen, and he needed loyal followers for this journey. Charles Finch was one of them.\nIf he did it now and failed, he was gone for good, so he had to patient and curb his pride for now. Though, the long-term strategy was likely to stay a plan, but even if it did, the preparation he spent could be adapted for different purposes or approaches for the end goal of becoming a free man.\nReturning to his actions as a noble, one of the laborers whom his proxy adventurers inadvertently killed was Maverick. Since Maverick was unidentified, he didn’t know. Even so, he felt that it was not good that the identified laborers, whom these proxies accidentally killed, lost their lives.\nHe killed Maverick.\nIt was not just, but he would have to carry that weight. When he smiled at his long-term followers, his face shifted from cold ceramic to warm skin.\nChapter 22 - The Weaving Threads of Fate linkCharles Finch stared at the man standing behind the desk. This man looked just like anybody else that was supposed to be doing everything at the top and handling all the tasks. Though, in Charles’ eyes, he saw many different leaders from communities of which he had played a part in the past. He saw a branching out of various different people under those leaders and how these leaders interacted with them via conversations and representatives. To those leaders, it was just convenient, but it was more than just convenient. This was even more pronounced in the man behind the desk, John Roger, who wielded control of many things that Charles didn’t know but probably loomed over his life and that of his former friends and family and experiences. He saw the man who would bring forth changes that would tie his entire life together with a rope and make everything he experienced make sense instead of feeling confused and forgetful as an older man.\nThough, he was not an older man anymore. He was an older man who had been magically transformed into a younger man. This meant a whole wave of possibilities, so he already contacted hundreds of former friends and associates, getting responses from almost all of them. But the people who talked with him beyond the small talk and asked with hints of curiosity for long-term interactions were much fewer. These people, which he called “His Roots,” would be his roots into this earth and broader society, moving forward under the shadow of the great statue, John Roger.\nHe wanted to eat people and everything that they were—their knowledge, experiences, and beauty.\nHe ate chicken in the morning and in the night. Today, it would be no different with John Roger. He would stare upon the surface of his skin and lick it, expressing his deep desire for the fleshy makeup of his being. The representation of his nature and the epitome of himself were in his epidermis. The perfection that he sought was within the grace of the epidermal weaponization of hope and glory. He would starve after his mind.\nHe just felt thirsty and dreadful, so that was why he couldn’t help but feel a great hunger that coincided with the physical consumption of a human being in order to express his great empathy and love through the communication of touching.\nHe loved a human being, and he would express it if all the familiar methods didn’t work. Physical consumption of the person of interest would be an expression of his great love.\nBut he was just a little scared. If he couldn’t express his love toward all the people who were kind to him throughout the years through the representation, John Roger, he would lose it.\nHe would save a soul by taking a bite, just one bite.\nBut he was capable of functioning within a society and contributing to an accepted social framework. So his urges were cut short and placed into compartments within his mind, sectioning the variety of expressions trapped within the momentary confusions and the long-term reflections which sustained his reconstructed memories.\nHe was not going to be normal. He was normal, an intelligent human being capable of emotional accents.\nHe immediately moved forward to contact His Roots, who came from a large variety of territories and settlements, many of which adventurers managed with broader collaboration with nobles, other officials, advisory committees, and boards. Most of these settlements were too many and defensible that the larger nation-state avoided annexing them.\nBut he was scared. He would achieve his goals productively, but in the end, he was self-aware to the point that he would be willing to take out a human being in order to enlighten others of the beauty of a human being. This self-awareness was distinct from good morals, as he was merely energizing his intent within the chamber of his own spirit, creating a weapon of devastating effect: mental instability. For clarity, his spirit was mature in the sense that it underwent extreme stress, trauma, and the exacerbation of mental vulnerabilities. But maturity in this case was a negative. In other words, his intense self-reflection contributed to distress.\nDespite the kindness he held as a manifestation of his positive experiences, the moral confusion that arose during his negative experiences with bad actors contributed to a delusional intersection between love and murder. The idea that hurting was caring blurred in his mind.\nSo he was capable of loving, but he was also capable of having a hand in someone’s ruination.\nThis was why he needed a healthy, stable lifestyle and prolonged association with healthy people to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable behavior and pre-behavioral meditation.\nAs mentioned earlier, long discussions were helpful in orienting the complex nuances behind common definitions. From a more complex standpoint, communicatory modalities, such as words, tone, and non-verbal expressions, retain and enhance their effective value in ever-evolving social structures through extended engagement with others. In conclusion, interpersonal orientation minimized socio-cognitive latency and optimized the spread through each nodal state, which represented a retrieval cue, of the patterns of socio-reflection.\nIn sum, Charles was a profoundly self-aware yet damaged soul, who could only keep going in order to exact the ideal of kindness to repatriate it into the world.\nHe was a person who idealized calculation or self-interested cold heartless planning, but in a world so full of death, he was just a man. But that was more than enough for his purposes.\nHe would do anything to make them smile. He would do anything to do something for once in his life. He would bloody his hands to destroy evil and Suffering.\nUltimately, even if John Roger was likely grooming him for violent progression, he would not be helplessly still.\nHe would be mentally unstable in his path to progress, because humiliating oneself to do the right thing was weird and crazy.\nCharles stared at John Roger, and it was all he needed to feel a sense of excitement. He didn’t desire control. He desired to love John Roger, as his role models loved his younger self, the kind, incorruptible, perseverant weakling who failed many times to stand for himself and the people he cared about.\nHe would do something this time. He would not sit still. He would become the epitome of grace and beauty.\nHe would become everything.\nInstead of doing anything, Charles watched his new boss, John Roger, as the meeting between Charles, the 70 adventurers, and John continued. He was not a part of the group of proxy adventurers officially yet.\nThe only sign of his big inner thoughts was an invisible teardrop from his left eye down his cheek.\nMeanwhile, John Roger smiled playfully, his voice like a jolt: “Isn’t that great? Why don’t you guys just relax and take your time? Here, have some food. I know what I said was a little heavy, but we must press on, right? We don’t want to have to do anything else but keep going right? It’s hilarious though, isn’t it? No joke, right? I’ve seen plenty of goblins over there and over here, and I know you guys want to take them out. But let’s be serious. I haven’t been able to get the gate done yet, so it’s good that you guys were there. I’m thankful. Good job everyone. I know, I know. It’s difficult, and it’s not. It’s so awesome though, but it can be quite tiring. Here’s the food.” A group of women entered with one woman leading at the front, placing bowls on a table nearby sequentially. It took over 10 minutes before all the bowls were carried from outside the room onto the table. “Thank you, Lortraine,” John said, nodding decisively.\nThe woman smiled politely and left the room, closing the door.\nThe adventurers stared at John, glancing between each other, as they slowly got up one by one. They widened their eyes and slowly raised a hand, hesitantly pointing at the food and at themselves. Basically, they were communicating if they could eat.\n“Eat!” John said with a polite thumbs-up. Though, he leaned back with a confident and almost introspective posture, looking downward and putting his hands on his hips in a composed manner.\nDespite his speaking skills, John was merely good at speaking from a performer–audience or leader–servant angle. He was like an introvert who went wild on a stage.\n“What matters is we get things done, right?” said John, pointing out the papers on the ground next to the adventurers. They placed it down when they started eating. Each of the papers showed a detailed map of their current activities and plans for what they should do by the end of the month. He also put the word “rewards” at the bottom. It was like a regular quest. He knew exactly what adventurers loved, as he was a fan of them.\nThe adventurers maintained a wide-eyed, humble demeanor, some nodding minimally in response.\nHe addressed one of the adventurers quiet enough only for the two of them to understand and sat down beside him. He began talking louder, as the adventurers began talking to each other in groups as well.\nJohn couldn’t maintain his playful tone and said seriously: “How are you now?”\nThe adventurer he was speaking to was a man named James Boulevard. “Good,” he said awkwardly, as he was trying to sip the noodle halfway in his mouth. He noticed his fingers got wet with the soup, so he clumsily used his own clothes to wipe the soup off his hand.\nJohn looked around and realized he didn’t have cloths for wiping here, so he just ignored James’ mess. “How ‘good’?” He smiled subtly as James tried to sustain raised-eyebrows look.\n“Good in the sense that I was able to save several dogs today—” He chuckled. “It was a good thing that I was able to finish off my painting before that.” He was proud of his paintings, so he often showed them in his living room. In contrast, he was also a small-time adventurer who enjoyed taking small jobs. In the end, the fact that he became one of John Roger’s proxy adventurers was a testament to John’s followers’ understanding of the street. But it was more than just his perspetcive as a small-time adventurer. He was a really talented person in connecting himself with big-time adventurers due to his paintings. The fact that he got involved with a noble like John Roger proved that he was more than just a habitual artist. It may seem like James was a useless doormat, but being someone with lots of elucidating connections meant a lot in a very confusing city full of complex structures, especially considering magic. He was like a stack of torches in a dark forest where monsters roamed.\nIf someone was not talented in raw fighting power, they could be talented in everything else that mattered much more in a society. Punching taxes was not going to solve anything, but being an adventurer with lots of connections and a strong understanding of their social framework did.\nThis was why John Roger had to make sure to have as much James as he could, because they represented the social fabric rather than a hot potato of a fighting tool. As for why power was a hot potato, several reasons could be identified. One, maintaining armed forces was expensive and tiring for not just the government but also for the individuals within these forces as well. Two, public scrutiny from other nobles and people in general was like having the sun lying next to one when sleeping. Three, power was inherently unstable, as just two years was enough for someone to lose everything completely. It could even be less than that, as controlling a population was challenging, similar to using one’s tongue to remove the food debris stuck in one’s teeth. So clear and regularly supplied rewards and objective results were needed to maintain effectiveness of this power organization. People were not static numbers that supplied a certain amount of power for each future fight. They were ever-changing and always requiring new things to stay in good fighting form. It was like taking care of kids who were stuck in the puberty and coming-to-age stage forever, but the kids were many. And the world they seek to affect was full of many people who set boundaries and would retaliate if he didn’t respect norms and processes. If someone like him could kill everyone, who could deny that someone was holding back the same power to do so? He had to be defensive for the most part and aggressive judiciously.\nThat was why he needed to be active in the administrative process of the government in order to reap the benefits of a noble, which would make executive connections smoother for himself.\nAt the moment, James was enjoying his food, as the rest of the adventurers sat around and laughed with each other because of a joke that shook them like a tornado.\nIt was hearing their enthusiastic voices primarily from his right ear that John recognized that adventurers did live a life he couldn’t.\nThe next day, on day 21, elsewhere, the teenage group including Billy, Nathan, Notch, Shadrach, Robert, and 7 other boys and 2 women were already a well-established part of a low-level adventurers organization. Rather than being directly connected to adventurers as a whole, they offered services that leaned more to small tasks like trash collectors and such. Fortunately, Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair showed support and guided them through the process, which Nathan soon learned to accept due the level of stability they achieved on their own.\n“Hi guys, how are you doing?” said Nathaniel, smiling enthusiastically.\nBilly could tell immediately that something was wrong, but he dared not say anything until Nathaniel revealed it himself.\nNotch asked, “Nathaniel, are you okay?”\nNathaniel stopped and almost chuckled, but he shook his head. “I lost my job.”\n“Really?” Notch said, looking away as if he heard Nathaniel talk about something casual. But he maintained respectful eye contact.\nNathaniel’s grin deepened. “Yeah.”\n“Is it because of us?’ Notch sounded casual rather than guilty. He glanced at the rest of the members of his teenage group.\nNathaniel shook his head. It was his choice to go so far for the boys. “No.”\n“Then why?”\n“The board lost confidence in me after I extended my hand too thinly for you guys.”\n“Then why didn’t you make better decisions?” Notch said, putting pressure on Nathaniel.\nConcerned about the possibility of Notch offending Nathaniel, Billy interjected, “Hey.”\nNathaniel said, “I did try, but it looks like I really was asking for too much from those under my jurisdiction… at the time.”\n“Yeah, I can see why that’s the case, I think,” said Shadrach.\nNathaniel glanced at Shadrach.\nNotch sighed. “I don’t know.”\nAnother boy used this as an opportunity to fill the gap, Marche, saying, “Nathaniel, can you help us carry these boxes and things?” He pointed to a list of boxes that Billy’s parents used for their vendor stall.\n“Okay…” said Nathaniel. “Wait, I’m not capable. I mean, my hands and my body are not that strong.”\n“I get you. Then, sit down over there.” Marche pointed to a dirty curb.\nNotch, Shadrach, and Billy returned to carrying the crates and grabbing old papers that fell to the ground and were being pushed away by the wind. They were planning to use these papers for a fire.\nThey showed up to a small-time quest regarding catching a bunch of rabbits in a big forest as one team.\nThey had a game plan now, as Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair was present.\nNotch fell to the ground. “What now?” he mouthed to himself.\nThe trauma of losing 48 friends in front of him was weighing on him, and Nathaniel’s news made him relive the feeling.\nHe burst into tears.\nHe was only a kid.\nNotch, Shadrach, and Billy embraced each other, all beginning to cry loudly, as the rest of the group guided them away from the crowds and into some place more private in the wilderness. They went back to Northe Road, the only place where they could go and where it was relatively quiet.\nNathaniel followed behind, tears dripping down his face.\nAt 13 years old, Shadrach saw his mind swirl, as he ventured into the dreams he had several days ago, distracting himself. When he saw that he was distracting himself, which was a sign of distress, he began to write down the words on a notepad: “I wanna die.”\nAt 18 years old, Billy began to shake, as he suppressed his frustration, a manifestation of grief.\nAt 11 years old, Robert imagined what would happen if he became cool like a noble, as his childish thoughts and his grief coincided to form a sense of emptiness and an inability to think at all.\nAt 16 years old, Nathan was staring down, but he didn’t feel anything. He couldn’t, and he was only looking down to respect the seriousness of the situation. He didn’t know why he felt calm, but he was also scared now that he knew that he was calm when it was unnatural, considering he was a part of the traumatic incident alongside Notch and the rest. He was trying to deal with it his own way, but it was a bewildering journey.\nStill, Nathaniel wanted to help them. But to be truthful, even with everything, all he desired was to remain part of his wife’s life and his family’s. He had several children, but none of them were human beings.\nIf they could become like the love of gods in this earth, then maybe they would be okay.\nChapter 23 - James Boulevard: The Goblin Slayer linkElsewhere, fortunately, following the meeting with John Roger, Charles walked outside, following the lead of the adventurers as he stumbled upon a goblin camp. The information of scouts led them here, and some of the scouts were screaming for help as goblins plunged their knives into their sides.\nThe human scouts’ bodies fell to the ground like a bunch of buildings under magically enhanced siege.\nOne of the aforementioned adventurers with Charles, James Boulevard, was there.\nJames, facing the wrath of the goblins, brought upon them his superiority.\nHe slashed them and laughed, slashing them again and again. “Disgusting, wretched creatures!”\nHe slashed them from the left and from the right. He stomped their heads and kicked them forth.\n“I hate these things!” he said.\nHe married his sword into their eyes of light and cut them short in halves.\nHe sliced little lines that extended past the beauty of their skin and entertained the light of the sky. He joined the heavenly praises of eternity when he sank his blade upon their skull.\nHe released his blade into the hurricane of a series of kicks, stabs, and slices that created a beautiful imprint of red and blue. The red was the blood, and the blue was the water that rained down, blending the noiseless blood with the brightest sky.\nHe loved them thoroughly by murdering their mind of evil.\nJustification was his weapon.\nBleeding them, he watched the adventuers nodding decisively, feeling the weight of the nods like the mountains themselves were bowing. It was the pressure of societal decision-making and cultural erasure. He was casting his mighty love upon their weakly souls by separating the wheat from the chaff. No more pain. No more suffering.\nJoyous moments of gladness happily shook hands, and it was here that the worth of a human being was defined from the goblin kind. The hatred of monkeys and goblins by humans were that fear of meaningless and broken hegenomy.\nHe loved people, but goblins received his bitter end.\nHe would let the rough end drag, and the erosion here would be the goblins’ faces upon the coarse path.\nHe nodded with himself. He had completely justified murder: the rats, devils, and secret puppeteers of the government, the goblins, were now gone.\nFleeing, the goblins that remained turned their backs on the humans.\nIn their shared language, they called the humans “Kalats”. Moreover, “goblins” was an exonym, and goblins were not a single, distinct, or self-defined people. As for why they were people rather than “monsters” or “barbarians”, these latter terms were derogatory ways to denote a person with different speech and customs.\nThe goblins, helpless, looked at their hands.\nTheir ego was going to fall down the drainage patterns again.\nAs they looked at their fellow goblins screaming and crying as their lives were taken away before their time, it entered their mind that they should punish the oppressor in kind.\nThey ran, giving their lives for their goal.\nCharles locked eyes with the last goblins in the camp.\nThe terror in their faces shifted to rage when the goblins recognized that they had to keep moving forward.\nThe adventurers and the goblins collided.\n“I’m sorry, Grace.”\n“I’m sorry, Clara.”\n“I’m sorry, Aidan.”\n“I’m sorry, Ciara.”\n“I’m sorry, Andrei.”\n“I’m sorry, Robyn.”\n“I’m sorry, Alkers.”\nThe goblins had spoken their last words to their loved ones one by one.\nThe adventurers looked distressed, overshadowing the frail bodies of the fallen, which comprised of all the goblins and one adventurer.\nThe adventurers gathered together around the fallen adventurer like an embrace or a fortified fortress.\nThey were never going to lose again.\nYet, they lost a friend.\nLater, they began to grieve over their friend, Michael.\n“What did he like?”\n“He liked the sun and the way it seemed to crack.”\n“What did he last want to do?”\n“He wanted to ride a dragon.”\n“What was he like?”\n“He was a strong man, who only thought about what he had to do. He kept going and doing everything in order to make sure he was not becoming a monster. He always asked himself whether or not he was doing the right thing by going into adventuring rather than staying with his family in a safer job. He said once that maybe, he was indeed a monster for not spending enough time with his family and for becoming an adventurer, an honest but unappreciated role in the world.”\nThe fallen adventurer, Michael, got a burial, while the goblin militants rotted.\nIt was only right that Michael got it, as the goblins were just violent monsters who wanted to erase humanity.\nThe morning was bright, and it stared upon the goblins and humans. The strands of nature extended outward like the hands of the goblins when they looked at them earlier. The vibrations of the forest with all their sounds, birdsong, and pleasures looked similar to the shaking hands of the goblins as they began to charge earlier. The clearings of the forest looked red in the sunset like the bloodied nails of the rotting goblins.\nJames enjoyed fighting goblins, and his hatred of them was normal. It was like enjoying a cup of water in the morning. It was so ingrained that he didn’t use the word “culture” for it. It was just like breathing. Since it was so culturally normal for people to slay monsters, James still retained his values of loving people, specifically humans. In other words, he didn’t extend that empathy to goblins. But his hatred was also not shared by everyone.\nHe didn’t hate them. It was not that he hated them, but they were so detestable that it was like looking at a disgusting child. Some animals were so horrid and like pests that they deserved to die. He would feed a goblin to a bear because of how horrid they looked.\nIt was not hatred. He was not trying to be. He was an understanding of the social fabric. He was a part of that social fabric, and in this social fabric, he was capable of the subsequent removal of pests. Goblins were not pests. They were more like people that had a big problem with management and control. They were incapable of humanity. They were incapable of thought processes that adhered to more higher purposes. It was sad that the goblins died, and it was really not that great. Preferably, he would look at them and say okay. But the problem was that they kept going and did their things. And it wasn’t great. They were killing people. That was not great. He had to stop them and do something about it. He didn’t kill anyone. He just saved people. Goblins were not something that deserved to die. It was more so that their actions led them to the point where their life was not at all productive or lending to a higher hopeful sky. It was like seeing a monster decide they want to do the most horrible thing in the world. He was not saying that they were monsters. He was saying they were like monsters.\nThey were just things one killed to get stronger and improve one’s skills. Adventurers were becoming better and stronger and more capable of defending people and being able to find treasures and loot. They were learning about the world.\nThe goblins—they were problematic—needed to do the right thing. And killing was not good, but goblins killing was not good either. Humans had to do something. They had to change things for the better, and it was true that they—the goblins—killed people. It was horrible seeing the goblins killing people. Sure, James did not see a single goblin kill a civilian, but he trusted people who saw it happen. He was not going to pretend that people were just liars when their entire life was clearly destroyed as a result of goblins. So goblins needed to start making sure that each of them were in proper form and focus. If one of them decided to kill a human family, then it was up to the rest of the goblins to take responsibility and recognize that they had to do something about it.\nJames and the other adventurers were merely making sure that goblins did not get away with murder.\nGoblins did horrible shit, so it wasn’t great at all. And James was being nice by giving them some respect by staring at them and saying, “These people…”\nHe was not saying that goblins were people. He was saying that they were representations of human values in the sense that they were doing everything wrong, and humans were trying to strive for the goal of peace and prosperity.\nHe had more to talk about the violent and oppressive culture of the goblins and how much they supported the violence against humans.\nBut he didn’t hate goblins. He just thought that people had to die in order for other people to live happily and in privilege. He could have been born as a goblin, but he was a human now. And his responsibility extended toward the control of the unchecked population growth of goblins.\nSo he was sorry to the goblins, but at the same time, it was part of his culture that monsters like goblins had to be hunted for loot and rewards. He couldn’t just tell people to stop killing goblins, because it was a part of who they were. It was like telling people to eat pulses and vegetables only. It was unfair for them to bear such a heavy weight.\nA person could easily judge the adventurer culture if they came from a culture that considered goblins to be citizens that deserved equality with humans. But becoming estranged from your family, friends, and everyday people after opposing one’s own culture was not something that regular people were willing to give up. The only people willing to give up their relationships was those who had already given up. He didn’t want to get attention or be hated. He wanted to fit in the social fabric and be invisible. He didn’t want to be that guy. He was not that guy who was going to save everyone. He was just a regular person. He didn’t want to hurt anyone or make people feel uncomfortable. He didn’t want to lose everyone because he imposed a new social standard. He wanted to be with everyone and have fun. He wanted to have a good time and relax with people whom he could trust. He was afraid of breaking out of the social fabric. He already lost communities so much due to time and change, and he was already much older now since then. With all that time, he only grew more intensely to love the performative nature of the hatred of goblins. It was a social construct, but he did it naturally because that was what a social construct was—born and raised. It was like eating with family and friends on special days. It was like attending cultural events and dancing along with them. It was like using a certain common phrase to greet strangers and friends. It was more than all of these comparisons, because it made people happy and it was politically supported, giving a sense of cohesion across so many different communities. It was like paying respects to someone older. He was not at all the kind of person who would murder goblins if it wasn’t praised so much. He would not kill anyone if there was no market or support for it. He would just sit down idly and relax and be a kind older man if people allowed him to be, but the physical daringness of adventurers was loved, thousands of hands reaching out for it.\nIt was like waking up in the morning and hearing the family one grew up with talk in the same way they had always done, but ever since one was young, alongside their kind, loving, and heartful actions and proclamations, they added a small statement that implied support for the hatred or killing of goblins every once in a while. This statement was with a quiet, disapproving voice, but it was usually brief and transient. It was culture and family values, and it was like being able to walk or being able to talk everyday. Losing these two would similar to losing his support for the hatred or killing of goblins.\nIn sum, he was not special, so he tried to fit in.\nMeanwhile, in a dungeon nearby, a detachment of adventurers from Charles’ group sang, as they arranged themselves like the various rooms of a manor.\nThe adventurers ran, pulling the goblins from one room to the next, entering into a corridor that led to multiple corridors.\nSimultaneously, another section of adventurers ambushed the goblins from one of these corridors.\nFrom among the adventurers, one adventurer bounced and slashed three goblins off their destinies.\nTwo adventurers skipped over and defended against a heavy blow from a goblin with frenzied eyes.\nIn the meantime, several goblins began preparing a brutal wave of magic, as particles emerged from the ground and floated to the ceiling. Flashing lights burst from all over the corridor, as adventurers tried to sink their teeth into the weaker goblin right flank.\nBefore the adventurers could reach them, the goblins revealed that the magic they were preparing was a distraction for a volley of arrows they hid behind the magic.\nAs soon as the arrows hit, the adventurers collapsed, as the goblins ran all over them, slaying them all.\nIn the end, in contrast to the 14 dead goblins on the ground, the group of fallen adventurers numbered 30.\nOne of the goblins, a necromancer raised his arms, and the dead goblins’ eyes opened, as they stretched their magically reforming bodies.\nThe necromancer could care less about the politics of goblins and humans from the viewpoint of a regular goblin. He was part of a “Pan-goblinist” group that sought to unite all goblins. What he cared most about was becoming a god. He moved his hands to the left and right, as he controlled magical particles at the small and precise level. Then, as soon as the goblins stood up, he clasped his hands, governing magically at the larger level, as the a silver wave emerged from his hands and slapped against the goblins. This completed the revival process at the cost of a huge sum of mana and years of imbuing marked mana into them while they were still alive. This marked mana was a specific kind of mana used to prepare the allied target for spells that required a certain amount of a kind of mana specific to each spell.\nThe reason he used this special revival spell now was because the adventurers were like titans, so any chance of beating them had to be used as promptly as possible. He was among certain descendants of prominent and influential goblin officials in the Joynehem.\nIn the end, he won, leaving the detachment of proxy adventures belonging to John Roger obliterated and swooping over the territory of the dungeon.\nOverall, this was the natural ebb and flow of territories between adventurers and monsters.\nChapter 24 - Navigating the Abyss: A Compromise of Life and Death linkShifting to Charles’ perspective, he was still apprehensive about murder and about the social structures that defined stability, struggling to marry his thoughts of hope and love with the brutality that adventurers employed in their systematic proceedings. It was like seeing the dirt of a city being thrown away systematically. It was a necessary pressing of the grapes to yield the vineyard wine. Despite his many experiences of killing “insects”, which were the goblins in this case, in his former close-knit communities, he still leaned toward goblin separation from humans rather than territorial killings. He preferred policing the goblins and creating borders to help keep the heightened tension between them separate and distinct in order to cultivate growth while emancipating responsibility from bloodied hands. It was a compromise, a deadly one still, but he wanted to be free from all this death. His eyes didn’t want to see the goblins and their suffering anymore, nor did he want the adventurers to grapple with the struggle of maintaining a sense of humanity. He was not okay with all of this, and it showed through a grimace. He wanted to push the wheel of overall decision-making toward segregation and camps. As for what he meant by “camps,” he thought moving goblins into camps if humans needed the territory and land would keep things simultaneously stable and not barbaric. He believed goblins were willing to participate in this resorting in order to promote human–monster peace and stability.\nBut he was not sure. Maybe, his solution was wrong. It had been done before, and disease would spread through the camps implicated in the past, causing thousands of deaths. But it was better than a war that caused 200,000 deaths. He was trying to fix the issue by relocating the damage into a contained place so that it didn’t “spread” and “contaminate” everything else. It was similar to moving away spoiled apples from fresh apples. He knew how loaded his analogies and terms were, but he thought that if the goblins wanted to continue existing as a species, a compromise had to be made. The humans were not going to relent anytime soon, as they preferred their rights over the idea of sympathizing with a monster. He was being realistic. He likened the segregation and camps to the communities that made up society, notably his former close-knit communities. These communities were separated from society yet interconnected. If he could make it so that the segregation and camps led to growth in human–goblin interconnection overtime. It could be a geopolitical success, considering the geographical wealth that goblins and humans would have as a whole. Yet, a human–goblin merger could be very bad for competition and growth, as it was easier to give goblins independence due to the cultural simplification and alignment and financial expenses involved in driving human–goblin transformation and restructuring. Letting goblins and humans grow independent from each other was likely to lead to better outcomes in terms of novel solutions and a more well-rounded growth overall. In the end, managing human–goblin tensions and interests while recognizing expenses, indepedence, competition, and growth was challenging.\nHis strong understanding of human–goblin relations resulted from his experiences with many, diverse close-knit communities rather than treatises. He applied these small microcosms by replicating them across a broader context in society—a form of extension or extrapolation.\nSpeaking of understanding, meanwhile, Billy, Shadrach, and Notch and the rest of their group were relaxing, but they knowingly waited for which issues mining would present with. Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair returned as the leader of the mining corporation after its board realized how much influence he held over the communities of the city. The miners of this corporation that trusted him demanded his return, signing a letter that promised that they would quit if Nathaniel didn’t return. His history of supporting miner unions and advocacy for mining entrants, among others, supported this decision.\nNow, he was required to report how many people he was apprenticing, what ages these people were, for what reason, the mother’s place of residence, and by what method. He was already reporting before, but it was not that consistent.\nRegardless, now that Nathaniel and his re-apprenticed associates, Billy, Shadrach, Notch, other other 9 boys, and the two women, could collaborate on a larger scale rather than alone. He was able to inform and educate them regarding mining with the help of people from his corporation. This led to them being able to anticipate a list of issues.\nSecondly, Nathaniel and his followers hired two adventurers this time to protect the boys: Red Striker and Lencriat.\nThird, since Nathaniel had to report regarding his apprentices, he began an introduction session.\n“Now, this is a continuation of the last time we met in my neighborhood. I want you guys to slowly take your time first. I really don’t want anyone left out this time.\n“We need to set goals and really get things together. The entire world is changing, so we need to stay in our lane. This means we’re going to have to say a bunch of things about ourselves, if that’s alright with you guys. I don’t want to push you guys any more than I have, but this is needed. If you guys don’t want it, it’s fine, but do recognize that we cannot move forward from here if you guys aren’t willing to work out differences and be honest. We need honesty here, folks. So, kindly please tell me your names first, so that the two guards, the adventurers, can listen.”\n“Notch.”\n“Robert.”\n“Shadrach.”\n“Nathan.”\n“Billy.”\n“Ethan.”\n“Sophia.”\n“Noah.”\n“Liam.”\n“Alexander.”\n“Oliver.”\n“Ava.”\n“Jackson.”\n“Benjamin.”\nNathaniel continued, “What are your ages? Back from the same order. Do it again from the same order.”\n“14.”\n“11.”\n“13.”\n“16.”\n“18.”\n“16.”\n“18.”\n“14.”\n“15.”\n“19.”\n“17.”\n“19.”\n“17.”\n“14.”\nNathaniel said: “That’s good. I think you guys are all above 13, except for Robert. Yes?”\nThe boys and women looked at each other, slowly beginning to nod.\nDecisively, Nathaniel nodded with a hum. “What’s next? What do you guys want to know about mining besides the one I already told you? I mean, you can ask about monsters and adventurers and all of that. I don’t want to give too much information, because you guys shouldn’t be thinking about all of that. What you need is experience and focus. So focus and tell me what you guys feel is appropriate for the mining.” He spoke quickly and reflectively with a soft, carefree voice, as if expecting things to change at any moment.\n“What should we wear?” said Liam. “What are our clothes?”\nNathaniel said: “Ah, that’s a, that’s a good question I think, because I guess we all need clothes. If you guys don’t like your clothes, I can help you guys some. Though, you guys told me about the market. I want you guys to do that yourself. With the adventurers’ help of course.” He glanced at the two adventurers next to him, and they nodded slightly in understanding.\n“Right!” He smiled in an approachable manner. “We need to get clothes for you guys, but more than that, we need weapons, right? Or maybe you guys don’t care about that.\n“I know… like why weapons? It’s really weird, and it’s not really that great. People could die, but at the same time, weapons don’t matter, right? But the problem is… as you guys have… know… It’s—without saying—necessary. It’s like the only thing that you should care about right now. So I’m going to help you guys fight, if that’s what you guys are interested… in. This is not at all what we planned first, I know. Initially. But it’s what we have now. So let’s get things together cohesively and put our thoughts so that we can just move on from this. All of this nonsense that comes with mining. I am frustrated regarding our progress, and I also care about you guys. So hopefully, we can—you know—“This is finished” rather than feeling like everything’s falling apart, you know. We are completely and utterly dead, okay? I am probably not helping you guys right now, but if we can just get this done. Then, we should move on, right?”\nWhat he was saying was casual and served as a way to bring a sense that they were in the same game, awkward, broken, and tired yet brimming with fervor. They were glad to be a part of this all over again. It was not the same this time. They could do it this time, because they knew that maybe, they would finally achieve their goals.\nTo streamline the discussion, Notch said, “What weapons would be good against monsters?”\n“Anything at this point. We have the adventurers, so we can be experimental.”\n“What does that mean? Why? Why not just grab the best of the best?”\n“Because we don’t know what’s going to hit us, so it’s best to stay slow and relaxed. Don’t try too hard. Do something that you prefer and finish everything, so that we don’t have to deal with anything. It’s not that great to force things. We need to elaborate how things work and then just work it out. Basically, do whatever is making sense to you guys right now. The mining part, of course, requires strict adherence to goals and objectives and benchmarks. We are not that great, right now. Our progress at a stuck stand point right now. We need to develop that’s completely yours, so do suggest.”\n“So we should pick anything?” asked Notch, smiling somewhat dismissively, confused. What he was hearing was basically do anything without any kind of thought behind it, but maybe he was wrong. The approach that Nathaniel was taking in terms of his diction and speech felt inefficient and meandering. Notch wanted to get this done, and he trusted him regarding how to proceed. So he was hoping to help Nathaniel by providing his thoughts, even if, as a peasant, he was not the best example of someone who deserved to be rewarded for his efforts. In the end, he wanted to move on and get things done.\n“In essence, yes. We should not… I don’t want to be too prescriptive, so do think for yourselves how you’re going to approach this. And then I can correct you, as we move along. This should be much more organic and smoother than what we did last time. You know. Sorry.”\nNotch cringed in frustration, which Nathaniel himself in the past would have done in response. However, Notch tempered himself, and Nathaniel was different now. “I want to know exactly what’s coming. Is there any details about that.”\n“The… Hmm… We shouldn’t go into the details just yet, because there’s a lot.” He chuckled when he said “lot”. “I’m not kidding. If we start talking about, we’re going to be really long here, so I want you guys to focus on just mining. It’s an enjoyable process if you guys don’t feel bothered too much about the air quality, the isolation, the smell, the back-breaking labor, the food, the way everything just feels icky and wrong, the… Everything. It’s not great if you’re looking to be entirely comfortable, but I know it’s a great thing that you guys are here rather than outside. Right?”\nNotch and the rest of the apprentices took Nathaniel’s words at face level and just nodded compliantly.\nIn terms of his rationale, Nathaniel was tired of pretending to understand them, so he wanted to focus on stalling and seeing how they would react. This way, when the time came for important, dangerous things, he wouldn’t have to deal with unresolved issues and things hidden things under the surface that came out in response to danger. In conclusion, he was intentionally taking his time re-evaluating the boys and women in order to define things for himself and for them with each other: clearing out the obstructing mist.\nNotch took a deep breath with pursed lips, making an obvious sound initially.\nNathaniel said: “Just relax and be patient. I don’t want any one of you to die.” He chuckled. “So please relax, and don’t try too much for now. No one expects you to be everything, okay? Just pretend to be nothing, which basically is not pretending any more. You guys are not at all crazy or disgusting or weird. So it’s not some moral obligation. I genuinely don’t you guys to be inefficient—the lack of efficiency is detrimental and could contribute to a range of issues later on.”\nListening to the methodogical way he sounded, the apprentices let go of their initial resistance to his reparative approach to the discussion.\nMeanwhile, the two adventurers Nathaniel hired as guards were present throughout the bonding discussion. Because of this, their motivation to stick to the group solidified. In the end, this precluded a Goldberg incident from occurring again.\nIf Nathaniel was the type to smirk in response to a victory, he would pinch his cheeks and make the widest smirk he could.\nTaking a broader view, the cave where Billy, Shadrach, Notch, and the late Millie went and to which Maverick carried bags in the past was important. It was more than just a mine for resources; it functioned as a buffering cache for supplies and resources. In addition, this cave transitioned well into the Northe Road, the name of which was a misnomer for a network of roads that moved activities between two neighboring countries. Moreover, many goblins refered to Northe Road as “Multa.” Finally, in light of the above, every other aforementioned story existed together.\nAs for a status reminder of the overall world 21 days since Maverick’s first appearance, the two adventurers who shared a drink with Goldberg after saving him were already on their way. Not just them but everyone else: John Roger of Trogan (1); Sarah, Elizabeth, and Mary (2); Charles (3); James Boulevard and the 69 other proxy adventurers under John Roger (4); the miners under Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair (5); the Marchacha goblins (6); Goldberg, Bean, Catherine, Samuel, Joseph, Benjamin, and William (7); Kahul and his companion (8); the goblin necromancer’s group (9); the adventurers who had fought the trolls (10); the adventurers who had gone into Nathaniel’s mine to find the Marchacha goblins (11); Goldberg’s children, Nash and Leia (12); Goldberg’s wife, Priscilla (13); John Roger’s servant, Lortraine (14); Catherine Orlov Sinclair (15); the monster in the form of a chest on four spider-like legs and the two humanoid demons (16); the group of protégés (17); the thousand goblins finding a place to establish a settlement (18); the adventurer party whom Nathaniel had hired to help Shadrach for several days (19); the 47 friends, 20 contacts, and 15 enemies that the current and late apprentices had made by networking (20); the task master Sprutnoa (21); and the laborer Inframark (22); among others.\nAs for the current list of deaths of those who were mentioned previously, they were many and bathed in obscurity: many of their biological families were still ignorant. On top of that, people who almost joined the dead often hid from their families the fact of their near-death in order to avoid living what they used to enjoy but now consider to be meaningless: an effect of post-trauma discontentment. Fortunately, they opened themselves up to fellow survivors, which swerved them toward re-securing a foothold.\nChapter 25 - The Emergence of the Just linkAt the moment, feeling the weight of his position as the oldest in his original group with Notch and Shadrach, Billy stared at Nathaniel.\nHe was all for the motivation and the feeling that things were going to work out.\nBut it was only right that they destroyed society in response to suffering, was it not? So they should become the everything that had ever wanted so that they might obliterate suffering once and for all. This was righteous. If not destroy society, then he should do everything that essentialized power and control. This way, the deaths of his fellow apprentices would not be wasted and turned to nothing. He couldn’t pretend anymore.\nWith his emotions touching their limits, he said yes to Nathaniel’s proposal for him, Alexander, Oliver, and Jackson, the oldest of the apprentices.\nNathaniel saw high morale, so he capitalized off it and sent him out to mine out in several directions, equipping him with the best gear and equipment. As for the reason of this, he would be paving the road as the cave would be stubborn at times with lava pockets here and there.\nBut the problem was that all this time, the wishes for change ripened finally in a rewarding manner. As for what this change would be, it was death on a massive scale, all underpinned by the notion “This world needs a reboot.”\nIn the wilderness, not too far from the city where Nathaniel and the others were, a man formed from the dust, and his mind was affixed on the notion.\nHe smiled and recognized the weight of his purpose and value, bleeding the cities dry of human beings. Goblin kind would cast rice upon him as a symbol of their profound gratefulness for the salvation that he would bring upon this world through the death of the human species.\nHe mattered, and his destiny aligned with love and authority. So he would destroy the [human] places.\nIt was not that he was destined here necessarily. It was that he was justified that he was here right now at this moment. The world justified his existence and told him, “You matter.” So his existence was justified by necessity alone.\nHe would become the epitome of their prayers and wishes, their cries and debts, their atonements and their grief and loss. He represented them—their rage and their desire to rip apart the human scum.\nHe walked, every step a justification of the emergence of his existence. It was truth, divine, glory, and terrible. It was an all-consuming flame.\nHe magically cast his love, sending meteors of varying sizes upon the human settlement.\nMeanwhile, Nathaniel was one of many to experience the sound of the thunderous impact of a magical meteor shower. Death accumulated slowly like water floating “upward” in a space.\nThis was the Just’s love.\nTo clarify, the Just was the man who had sent the meteors.\nThe thing was that the Just was just a powerful person who had lived a long ambitious life that lasted several months. He only emerged now because he was suddenly called to his current path through some strange, unknown magical solution. In his life before he was called, he met many, many people and beat many enemies, so he was possessed in a sense. He had become the Just, representing a role or identity that was perhaps predestined or unavoidable.\n“The solution to solve the human race” was to massacre them weakly, broken people because they deserved it. It was not rage or anger that entailed his actions. It was love, and he was giving them much needed massacring love.\nThe Just appeared in the city, walking.\nThe men of the city avoided him or confronted him, but they would die all the same.\nIt was the story of old. Natural disasters would undo human life, and he was something like that: a punishment by divine intervention. It was a magical experience to see hundreds of adventurers running and trying to escape the end.\nMeanwhile, elsewhere, two former friends of the Just were walking toward the city, aware of his ungodly transformation.\n“He must have drunk a potion and turned evil because of it,” said a man named “Malkov”. “What else could have happened! He was gone just like that! Yesami is gone!”\nNext to Malkov, a man named “Junjirou” laughed exasperatedly.\nThe Just was Yesami.\nIn the Just’s eyes, he was embracing each adventurer, showing the love he wanted to, but he abandoned his kindness to reach his ambitions because the only way he could help others was to get results. He was hugging each one of them, sitting down with them, and talking about their lives in order to reach a sense of meaning and truth with regard to the value of human life.\nShifting to reality, adventurers fell, as the Just held them and burned them with fists of flame. The world felt like a hourglass cracking, spinning, turning, gravitating inwardly into a miniscule ball of infinity. It was death turning its head.\nHe felt so incapable of loving others that he became the Just, who could only “love” through the most mute form of expression: violence. If he could eat them, swallow them, bite them, lick them, crush them, punch them, slap them, burn them, take their life away, then, in his sick and twisted mind, he would finally be able to love others, as all other methods seemed to fail, especially considering his highly ambitious past.\nNow that the Just was complete, he begun.\nFirst, in a dim alley, a weight smashed into the warrior’s back, and he fell lifelessly.\nSecond, next to this warrior, a mage’s protective barrier slowly evaporated along with him, leaving only bits and pieces.\nThird, in the distance, a barbarian succumbed to a colossal weight on his shoulder, his eyes becoming still. His body hit the ground.\nFourth, elsewhere, a sorcerer’s desperate spells backfired, as her mana and life force disappeared. Her body collapsed.\nFifth, on the rooftops nearby, an archer, seeking refuge, fell to an blast of magic.\nSixth, in the darkness of a nearby alley, a cleric’s prayers went answered, as light shone. But the light got cut out, and the ground swallowed her whole. Lastly, she reached out, smiling, before she exploded.\nSeventh, several steps away, an armored paladin’s defenses shattered as he became too terrified to think. In the meantime, a hammer-like force smashed him to dead silence.\nEighth, in the distance, seeing the paladin’s body, a warlock’s invocation turned against them, the shadows strangling her to lifelessness.\nNinth, while the warlock fell to the ground, a druid’s tried to commune with nature, reaching out with a smile, as roots from the ground strangled her as well.\nTenth, close by, a couple of bards’s melodies got cut short as hundreds of spike-like waves struck them in the neck, as they suffocated on their own blood. Eventually, the invisible force even crushed their spirit, leaving them lifeless amid the chaos.\nEleventh, behind them, a necromancer cried, listening to the ground and the thunder of the peoples’ pain. In time, detecting an unforeseen force flying toward him, he relented, letting the dark magic consume him.\nTwelfth, beside the necromancer, a swashbuckler pointed out to several groups nearby, accumulating a larger force. From all around them, hundreds of invisible barriers ran toward them, crushing their feet first, then their legs, and, finally, their very souls, leaving them lifeless upon the stone path.\nThirteenth, in the middle of a nearby crowd, a monk tried to deflect an incoming attack, mustering his memories and dreams, his friendships and relationships, his family, mother, father, sister, and brothers, as a force frustrated him, burning him alive.\nFourtheeth, elsewhere, a cleric’s healing prayers continued, as she shook, her voice like an oscillating bird. With a pop, she fell to the ground. Her body rolling toward a smelly spot in the street, she noticed a mysterious force eating her amid her vocal turmoil.\nFifteenth, meanwhile, an illusionist’s deceptive mirage shattered, revealing the threat that swiftly dispatched him.\nSixteenth, behind the illusionist, a healer reached out to grab the illusionist before she succumbed to an indescribable burning inside her, saying no.\nSeventeenth, in the middle of a blood bath, a torchbearer reached out with his torch, hoping to bring light to the darkness of this event. But as soon as he stretched his arms as far as he could until his muscles tensed and his shoulders learned, he collapsed under the weight of the magic of the Just.\nReturning to the Just’s perspective, love was grandiose.\nIncidentally, the about-to-be-dead were loud, and most of them were in shock enough to make weird, probably delusional statements.\n“Adam, Adam, please don’t leave me!”\n“Mom, mom, I’m sorry, Mom!”\n“Can you help me one more time! Please!”\n“I can believe again…”\n“I am a god…”\n“Blowing in the wind, morning in the night. Sunshine—”\n“A certain cruelty…”\n“This life has meant nothing.”\n“I can finally rest.”\n“I am the only one with the will to act…”\n“We must do the right thing!”\n“I tried… In the end… I did.”\n“They’re too afraid, but we, no, we must do something about it. This time, we fight! Are our worths going to be defined by all this death? No! Their death inspires us all! They will not be laid here to rest. They will be carried onward. We shall be the expression of their unfulfilled rage. We press on, soldiers!”\nAnyway, the Just implicitly allowed the victims to speak but denied them the chance to live, emphasizing his role as an executioner. He had already selected certain parts of the city to attack, so he wouldn’t have to go through the trouble of doing this inefficiently and having to go around again around the same areas to find survivors. In short, the Just’s actions are not merely random acts of violence but are driven by a specific goal.\nSignificantly, his objective was to achieve a clean slate: a desire for a complete reset or reboot of the current state of affairs in the city.\nThe complexities, structure, organization, and interconnected city was in no way all-knowing of itself and of everything external to it. It was not expecting the Just.\nSo the Just, with all that he was and was justified to be, ascended in a forward manner, as his campaign of destruction was part of a larger plan or mission.\nNow that the social constructs of the city were falling apart, people were beginning to showcase their complexities, and the groups that already existed in the city became definite. Those who prospered only in the social hierarchy and norms rather than in fighting power and intelligence lost their power, becoming frail babies.\nThe Just was a love letter to the adventurers in a way, as the adventurers were expecting a downward trend that could signal the end of their reign.\nIn any case, whatever the concerns of those still living, the Just would remain predestined.\nNow, he was a patient man, considerate of the powers that be, but he was already on his way.\nThe problem was that many people were here: peoples from all kinds of different backgrounds and stories. Some of them were only kids who just got their training in magic, elven archers, tinkerer gnomes, drarven blacksmiths, halfling rogues, orc barbarians, mages, wizards, healers, clerics, rangers, paladins, bards, sorcerers, levitating monks, necromancers, beast tamers, doppelgangers, and prominent human warriors who excelled in a variety of skills like blacksmithing, archery, swordsmanship, and political plots. This list doesn’t even include the civilian professions. So the Just was casting his gazes at a populace and society, its individuals of interest largely unmentioned.\nSo either time would slow down in order for each person to gather themselves and express a long oral biography regarding how they came to be and their potential with attendant ambitions, fears, concerns, influences, and relations or the Just would just move on, a compact mass of flesh turning their beauty and glory, the richness of their lives, into shreds of past memories, an abandoned cohort of houses. To conclude, it was murder of a high order: genocide.\nIf each of the individuals shared their life story, they would make up thousands of interesting stories, each sharing a piece of a pie called Society. Nevertheless, the Just wouldn’t place them over his objective.\nIt was a matter of prioritization, not evil, according to the Just. Just as one might place emphasis on the long term, he placed emphasis on the eradication of human society for the perceived benefit of the world, as ecologically, the world could use a break. In the grand scheme of things, indeed, they were meaningless. Spreading awareness of the world was too challenging, even with magic, as people would always find a way to reject what was right in front of them.\nBut that was only the Just’s justification. Instead of using dialectic, he was using destructive force in order to impose himself upon others: individual benefit at the expense of the many rather than the well-being of the entire community. It was oversimplification because it was idealistic, but so was black-and-white thinking and the unyielding hatred toward certain marginalized populations.\nSo in this case, the marginalized populations would be humanity within the city in the “Great Slaughter,” the future name for today’s event. To clarify, this subset of humanity was marginalized relative to the grand scheme of things which offered no respite except for a drowing meaninglessness in the perspective of the Just.\nIt would be much better for him to engage in dialectic that provoked violent thinking instead of beginning genocide directly.\nSo genocide bla bla bla.\nBut this made the fight even more fun!\nThe Just swung his arms around, as several adventurers attempted to block, each of them gaining their composure. Simultaneously, the Just flicked a finger up, as several adventurers fell to the ground, their arms twisting and turning due to a magical gravitational force. Several adventurers grabbed the affected ones and healed them quickly, drinking potions in preparation, while they summoned magic shields to block the Just’s fiery meteors.\nThe Just was only using one arm now, but his other arm was busy killing isolated adventurers with no protection or healing potion protection in the distance.\nSo even with the adventurers running to each other, from time to time, adventurers would need to escape in order to prepare their long spells or heal a particularly nasty wound.\nSo the Just made sure each moment contributed to his end goal of survival and victory.\nThe adventurers cast a series of long-ranged attacks, coming one after another in order to make room for the destructive capacity that often had a delay after impact for its damage to take full effect. So it was a patient battle with fast movements here and there to give oneself potion protection and magic shields while retreating in order to take care of nasty wounds. Longer spells had to be adjusted with shorter spells, as having the spells deflect against each other would be inproductive. So the adventurers were quick to use spells that fostered communication in order to ensure that proceedings went along seamlessly.\nChapter 26 - The Just’s Reign of Terror linkTransitioning to the Just’s perspective, his eyes were burning, as bats flew out of them, catching the adventurers off guard.\nShifting positions and swapping places between certain adventurers, many of which with a variety of spells that didn’t always align well with volleys and larger scale fights. So many spells were underused or unused for the benefit of the effectiveness of the overall fight against the Just.\nThe Just smirked, as a barrage of spells fell upon the adventurers from the flank, catching them off guard again. He was pretending only to cast from the front and from above, inserting spells that killed off isolated adventurers around the flanks. He did it with slow-acting poisions, so the adventurers would often think that it was exhaustion that stopped them. He was devious, a devilish thinker.\nIn case the adventurers died all at once enough to block attacks or serve as a deterrent for the benefit of the Just, several adventurers fit their spells in order to avoid having this issue by having a small pause between attacks to make up for assessment, as assessing the direction of one’s spell after activation was difficult. Assessment and direction choosing often happened before spell activation, which had a delay before casting.\nIt was a seamless but break- and swap-filled transitional battle, each with certain adventurers that had to go in front in order to soak up the damage, being the first ones to fall when the healers made a mistake with the timing with the more offensive spells, which could interrupt the healers’ magic. It was a matter of conflict between packages of spells, so they had to cast them sequentially and with attention to certain unique spells and their considerations.\nAs for the Just, he was blasting several adventurers off into an alley, causing their skin to turn black with sickness.\nAdventurers climbed from above and shot him with spells, but the Just immediately casted a giant, ghostly hand to bring them all down and use them as human shields. This was costly for his mana, but he did that to make the adventurers hesitate again, as he often incorporated disruptions that lended to a break in routine and order of firing among the adventurer mages.\nWhen the adventurers were too disordered, the Just exacerbated their discord by using his most flashy magic: a basic way to get the adventurers attention while they were busy trying to re-seam power.\nSpeaking of power, the Just clashed, putting down adventurers one by one from all kinds of positions, showing the adventurers that they couldn’t move to safer positions within the main fighting group to avoid his wrath.\nThey could only advance face-front.\nIn order to prevent dying to a sweeping attack, the adventurers made sure that each of them maintained a 2-meter distance in the absence of an costly-to-maintain formation-wide magic shield. This made for a nasty attack when the spells were combined, but it depended on the strategic arrangement, not only positionally but in terms of delegation, as individuals each had a unique role and set of skills that required tailored planning.\nOne used a spell called “[Choke]”, so as soon as he got his ability primed, he choked the Just for a brief moment, acting as a punch to the neck rather than a full-on choking.\nThe Just cancelled his ability and rerouted his mana off to an adventure, centralizing his mana into one spell specifically to obliterate the caster who cast “[Choke]”.\nBut the adventurers made sure to react, centralizing their spells to defend the caster. It was a devastating, singular attack that could be countered with a re-orientation defence. This was like playing with throwing balls, but in the longer scheme of the fight, the Just primarily utilized his isolated adventurer killing left hand and pushed remarkable spell combinations with his right. When he did attack with both arms, it was when the adventurers were particularly lacking. So he made sure that the adventurers would lose by attrition, because a devastating singular attack was easily identifiable and strategically easy to deflect and stay composed against.\nThis was a matter of underhanded or complex tactics, arming confusion to make orientation hard to do, as simplification was always primary in formation handling. However, the Just was only one person, so his magic had to be casted one by one through his thought process. He could only focus on one spell at a time, but most of his spells were instanteous and requiring little challenge like a master visual artist utilizing a diverse array of techniques but only feeling it as the process of drawing rather than the complexities they served in the final canvas result.\nHe was a master spellcaster.\nSo he retreated and dodged away often to avoid having to waste mana blocking certain devastating singular attacks. As for how instanteous the adventurers’ attacks looked to him, they were “randomly” inserted during moments where the Just was perceived as most vulnerable to a secretly appendant attack. Delving into how challenging and precise they were, it went insofar as every other easily noticed and overt attack hid a visually or sonically concealed one. From a metaphorical lens, this was like a network of disconnected secret rooms not in the blueprint of a house. On a more visual note, it looked like poly-pronged spells consuming each other and growing in power like an abstract splash of paint on a canvas, evolving into a nasty striking. Finally, it seamed through plans and attacked when back-and-forth responses were most seamless: a moment of pure elegance in “magistry”.\nIt was a binary battle of well-timed, alternating retreats and advances marked by hyper-sensitive and immediate turn-arounds in order to catch the other off guard. Discussing why this occurred, magic facilitated communication, movement, and trades or attacks insofar as the combatants looked like they spasmed directionally back and forth, each incorporating movement at their own pace. Moreover, these retreats and advances were not only positional but also magical, because spells could be rescinded, paused, accelerated, focused, drawn out, broadened, and twisted to fit certain attack arrangements, each restructuring decision with its own set of benefits and consequences. So experiences and histories had to be aligned along with cognitive processes, which served as the foundation for magic incarnate.\nSo for the most part, the fight should have been more so movements and positions than actual brutal death, but the Just was overwhelming, while the adventurers relied more on their formations and numbers. But their ingrained habits and tactics were isolated to fighting groups of monsters rather than a multi-spell mage, taking into account that even one effective combat spell was commonly impressive.\nAs soon as the Just beat down the adventurers, he walked over them.\nA burst of communication circulated across the adventurers like a watersnake, entering into ears and exiting mouths, as magic glowed from nearby hands. But it was cut off, because the Just killed it.\nHe just removed them with his hands, and his mind swiftly saw them gone and out of his attention.\nThe adventurers got back up, as a blast of magic healed all the adventurers. This marked the rise in prominence of one particular healer with a well-combined set of spells. She had stacked her buffs in order to achieve a certain quota to cast the indiscriminate healing in an area of effect. Her aura was already dying down, as the adventurers’ broken bodies healed up.\nA barrage of spells flew once the Just advanced to a certain distance, as the Just dodged, advancing forward, several spells slamming into his person.\nBefore the Just began to lose momentum, he swung both arms, magically decapitating those from the weaker right flank, as heads thudded against the ground and rolled downhill. It was “downhill” because they were on an undulating hill, so it was clear that it was uphill when pedestrians travelled upward. But it was not too roughly steep that it felt alarming.\nToday was the end of an era. The spells from hundreds of years lost their spark, as the Just one-upped them, not too little that he would get a draw, not too much that he would waste his energy, just enough to get to the next stage. But he was largely inefficient in the grand scheme of things, because he could only play with so much information before he had to accept his limitations and act.\nTo clarify, the aforementioned “magistry” referred to the use of magic that implied skill and meticulous magic and was often used to praise someone’s attention to precision.\nThe face of one fallen adventurer stared at the Just, his memories whirring, playing back his life.\nWhen he was a boy, he would always ask himself the same question: “What’s that?” But now that he was older, he was afraid of asking those questions because everyone around him seemed like they knew what to do. In the end, when he realized that it wasn’t only his wife that didn’t know much about the world, it was his friends, family, extended family, and all the other adventurers and people he met throughout his life.\nAfter everything he had been learned and achieved as a regular man, he was finally hoping to ascend through the ranks and become an effective leader. This way, he could answer the questions he still didn’t know. He would answer the questions of those under him. Simultaneously, he would find the answers to his own questions. He didn’t know anything, nor did he expect the Just to kill him and everyone that he knew among the adventurers. He just knew that he had to keep going as usual, but today was different. Indeed, it was because he died, but it was also because he didn’t know he could just die like that. If he knew this a long time ago, maybe he wouldn’t have tried so much to care about all the useless things like finding answers. Maybe, he would have put all his attention to living simply and caring only for his family and hoping to see them smile, being there for them always. He hated to say that his journey to knowledge was worth it, as he could make much better decisions and teach others better because of it. But he wondered if he lost his soul in the process. He wondered if any of this mattered. Maybe it didn’t. Maybe, he was nothing.\nMaybe, it was all for naught, but he couldn’t accept that, even now as he was dying.\nHe died.\nIf he was still here, maybe he would be able to grow and improve overtime, learning to tend to life and others in a positive, overaching way. Moreover, he could have made changes and updated his understanding on life, achieving knowledge in the places he didn’t expect. He would learn that life was so much more valuable than he thought, as it was very challenging for life to exist. It was a very complex thing to understand, and the more he understood it, the more he realized that life had value in that it was hard to explain easily. He would find out new ways, experience new things, and find out his perspective was wrong the whole time as he found more nuance behind the things he just accepted as there. He would be able to appreciate things and ideas that initially stood out only as representations and devices as conduits for communication. If he was still here, he would find out he was a very, very awesome person, and he was going to be the best thing he could ever be, sharing knowledge that only he knew because he was the only one to experience that in the way he did in all its specificity.\nHe would remember when he was playing children’s games with his former friends, who were part of a community he was in. It was all so complex and complicated, full of diverse expressions, terms, jokes, and dynamics. It was like being part of a whole world, yet it was only a slice of life. He would remember when he was thirteen, he created so many craft projects, but he didn’t show them to others that much. Only a few people got to see them, and they were gone now. These projects told a very long story that he couldn’t distill into something fun. More than that, this memory was just one of many thousands. It was who he was that was so unique and ingenious, a person who represented certain kinds of people, yet a person in itself.\nBut again, this one-time person was not here anymore.\nIt was better to imagine what he was like in the fictional than to see him in the real, as he was no longer to hear to tell that long, funny story.\nThough, the Just loved the idea of slaying individuals. It made the fights more exciting in having high stakes. It was like defeating a powerful enemy full of the divine nature of a whole world inside them. It was like defeating oneself, who was always there and presented challenges beyond one day.\nIn the end, the Just was like a sudden fatal collision with a magical vehicle to humanity. He didn’t make sense. It didn’t make sense, yet it made all the sense for magic to breed something so powerful. If one person could do it and reach the black stars, the Just could do it.\nSo in a way, even if it was wrong, it didn’t matter because it was fun. That didn’t mean that he wasn’t aware of humanity. He grew up seeing people. He even made friends in the form of Maverick and Junjirou, but it was the fact that he just knew that it would be better doing something than living forever in the agony of helplessness. He had to try at least once to destroy a city just to see what it would make him feel. Then, maybe, he would realize that it was not helping him at all. In the end, it was like trying a new activity to see if it worked. His perception of humanity was very out of touch and skewed due to how much he avoided the toxicity of the world, only looking at the good parts and then developing callousness as a result.\nNow, as for the most prominent actors, parties, alliances, and confederations within the city, within the theater of the Just’s Great Slaughter, the Just was about to face most of them, as brave responders were crowding at the periphery of the Just’s established 50-meter radius. Though, this number was arbitrary and only brought up to help give a sense of structure to the responders and those interested in being at a distance enough to observe the Just’s actions while feeling safe.\nIn the face of such meaningless-creating evil, people could only work together and use magic to contact each other and establish unity in this difficult time.\nChapter 27 - Navigating Turbulence: Nathaniel’s Inner Conflict and External Challenges linkIn the meantime, Nathaniel stared at his apprentices, sitting down. “I lost you guys…” He was referring to his 48 late apprentices. “Yet, this happened. I… don’t know what to do.” It was the first time in a long time that he felt that he truly had no idea what to do. For the most part, saying that one didn’t know was merely an expression of how limited human understanding was. But in the case of the Just, he was so overwhelming that his “I don’t know” was more only than a philosophical statement. In this situation, it was an expression of dread and helplessness: malaise. This was in spite of the fact that he was right in front of his apprentices, toward whom he felt naturally composed otherwise.\nTransitioning to a longer, more complex level, the petrichor that came with the rain earlier, coupled with positive characteristics such as a well-nourished stomach, job satisfaction and work-life balance, a well-rounded lifestyle, robust marital quality, generally good mental well-being, and a wholesome, active physique, made it easier for him to process these emotions in full. This was consistent with his diminishing resistance to venturing into his emotional origins since the fatal incident befalling his late apprentices.\nIn his confusion, his face shifted subtly from amazement to frustration to happiness to regret to anguish to rage. He cringed through a brief smile, his pain obvious through the subtle stiffening of his cheeks. His brows quietly shifted inward, becoming furrowed. When he smiled again, it fell off, shifting into a partially teeth-closed and jaw-tight expression of pain. Then, his smile became that of scorn and mockery, as his brows danced between anguish and exhaustion. Overall, his expressions were brief and quick, happening in enough time for him to express everything before the boys could heed them enough to interpose about it.\nIn all his pain, no words could express the complex relationship between his whole history and how they all led to this moment. He knew frustration really well and was well-equipped to bounce back and turn any moment into a win. However, he was also compartmentalizing, putting his pains to the back of his mind with a tag that read “To process later”. This was his resilience, not necessarily callousness. People like him could abide by the need to address struggles only when the current situation allowed for it. In contrast, people who couldn’t postpone their emotions or delay the gratification of expressing their pains were those who needed time, space, resources, and a healthy environment to mature. Nathaniel just had that kind of environment, so he was normal. It was the political or business aspect of him that might have made him seem disgusting, terrifying, or oppressive. In his personal life, he was a nice person; though, it was impressions of someone through their occupation and the way they were characterized by others that diverged from his actual self.\nBut Nathaniel couldn’t go around willy-nilly spreading the idea that his personal history was a virgin forest for others to habitate.\nEither way, to balance the argument about Nathaniel’s business side and more approachable personal side, he regarded himself married to his work, as he thought it normal to be so involved with those whom his work affects. This blended the line between what was personal and what was strictly business operations. This was also why his corporation kicked him out initially and then brought him back as main leader again. As mentioned earlier, his more personal activities coincided with community building, which made him much more popular. It was not a political election, but people were very communicative and active in grassroots movements, making it easy for leaders like Nathaniel to ride along and put their name tag on them. So he did. Because of this, he obtained direct access to the people whence his mining operations hired and relied upon to operate without targeted government regulation due to an alignment between the local population, peasants and adventurers, and nobles who sympathized with them, among other reasons. As for why adventurers were included here, caves, dungeons, and adventurers often interconnected.\nOn a more nuanced note, in the local population most relevant to Nathaniel, the fatal incident was described as an accident rather than Nathaniel’s fault, with the help of local government intervention. Contrastingly, outside this local population, some voices accounted Nathaniel into the blame.\nIn conclusion, his perspective was considerable, but it was essential for the events directly influencing the aforementioned stories moving forward.\nSince the Just was a new element that would displace thousands of civilians, Nathaniel’s prominence among them would help guide, align, and support the civilians to a much safer location, one requiring basic resources to thrive for several weeks at least in case the Just did something even more catastrophic, while the combatants poured into the side that led to the Just: one side for the “civs”, or civilians, and another side for the fighters. But this was an oversimplification. In any case, Nathaniel needed to deploy his power in the assault.\nThough, the civilians were concerned about surviving and living and would rather have the combatants aid them instead, but the adventurers were not going to abandon their whole lives now: the cognitive dissonance was strong, even if it would be much more rational to focus on recovery, considering the established power the Just held. No one knew if the Just hid even more power, but the adventurers were willing to bet that they could beat him, as the evidence that the Just was impossible to beat was weak and still requiring due process. Those who did see him could only describe it in ways that didn’t really get the traumatic-inducing Just across effectively. Beating him stemmed from emotional and idealistic decision-making, but it was the balance between this and rational decision-making that entailed a healthy and thriving society. So the process behind their risky choices was right but at the wrong time. It wasn’t only the wrong time. It was the only time this had happened in their lives and in history. Similar situations of devastation happened before, but this was its own monster. In conclusion, even if the process in which many of the adventurers arrived at the decision to go and beat the Just was irrational, their decision or conclusion wasn’t necessarily wrong, because if they did beat the Just here, they would be right.\nMeanwhile, outside, on the streets of the city, a bunch of brothers ran toward the Just, shouting excitedly.\n“Huya!”\n“Speed!”\n“I am speed!”\n“Alright!”\n“Here we go!”\n“Watch the moves!”\n“It’s too easy!”\nTheir hyped-up voices were well-heard by Nathaniel and his apprentices and hired guards, who were still far away from the Just.\nFor some reason, the brothers and Nathaniel’s company were sure that they would win, because it just couldn’t be a loss. It couldn’t be.\nIf they won, they would finally be able to see the people together again, families arming themselves in times of conflict, and loneliness averted.\nNathaniel smiled. “I guess let’s keep walking,” he said, as he began leading the relaxing stroll.\nNext to Nathaniel, his apprentices identified the nervously conversing families all around in the distance, studying their expressions and learning from them. Since they were confused and scared, they found comfort in the shared tension in the air that brought people outside in the streets in a vulnerable manner. It was like having a big group hug and trying to walk in that arrangement at the same time.\nA sociable teenager, Shadrach, glanced at the two guards with him. “How about you two? Tower?” To clarify, in a discussion earlier, 7-odd minutes after the Just attacked, the guards told Nathaniel that they were heading to a certain tower at the end of the day. To provide context, Sinclair and the other apprentices noted this information enough to ask about it. Touching upon the reason behind this, children were very conscious of everything their parents said. Therefore, it was natural that teenagers, especially apprentices, would pick up everything their authority figure, Nathaniel, discussed, notably at a turbulent time like this. On a broader level, the time spent together between Nathaniel and three of the apprentices, Shadrach, Billy, and Notch, since the day after the death of these three’s former boss, Maverick, meant something. Moreover, these three and the other 11 apprentices survived a fatal incident together. Through sharing the same set of challenges, they learned from each other when it came to understanding their place under Nathaniel. In spending time with him, they became more attuned to the subtleties of his speech and non-verbal language. Ultimately, they used him a frame of reference for understanding what the guards’ deal was about when they were glancing attentively at him throughout his and the guards’ discussion earlier.\nTurning to the guards’ perspective, they were broadly similar to Goldilock, being adventurers, But they were here right now in the wake of the Just’s attack. They would be important moving forward, so they were naturally willing to communicate, considering the importance of this in parties. It was an service-related benefit: the ability to just get on with it and shout out crucial information. They said: “The tower is an important structure for adventurers. What are our goals?”\nNathaniel was about to answer, but Shadrach was too quick this time: “We’re going home to check my parents and their parents too. Likely.” As he was beginning to write, he used the more fancier word “likely” in speech, imitating his betters, to offset the perception of immaturity in saying “my parents”. In short, he still behaved like a normal person his age.\nReturning to the guards, one of them, Isaachar, decided to answer questions preemptively after seeing how fruitless Shadrach’s input was: “The tower was an important structure because it was a very long-standing one. Been there for years. It probably has been there since I was young. Though, I do remember that my parents, who were adventurers, also agreed at a meeting that it should be named “The Tower” simply, because now they officially call it “The Bastion”, which people don’t really use. Only the uptight ones tended to do that.” Even he was not talking about things relevant to the currently happening Just’s attack, but it was useful information in the long term. “Now that that’s done, let’s—”\nIn front of the guards, Nathaniel turned around and raised his hand. “Wait, wait, let’s help her.” He motioned the guards to help a wounded woman lying down in an alley.\nMeanwhile, looking particularly at Shadrach as a representative, Nathaniel told his apprentices to refrain from trusting the adventurers’ words at face value, as he had a bad history with adventurers collectively. Prior to this, he envisioned Shadrach as the leader of the apprentices at one point when he sent him out on a study mission into a dungeon with a party of adventurers he paid to guard him. To connect the dots, it was Shadrach’s proactive question to the guards that reminded Nathaniel of this early concept design for him as a laborer.\nConsidering Shadrach’s implicit position as representative of the apprentices, his closest friends here, Notch and Billy, were confident that he would handle anything that came up. For that reason, they patiently watched him instead of asking.\nShadrach glanced at his friends. One thing he noticed was that Notch didn’t have his favorite apple or any food for that matter. Consequently, he learned that Notch’s allowance from Nathaniel was inactive today. Though, he wasn’t sure. In reality, he was right.\nInstead of initiating a serious, boring talk about the apple, Shadrach made a funny joke about Notch’s armpits, considering that Notch woke up too early, too tired to trim it. It was cultural to have as little armpit hair as possible, and it was not only for girls. In fact, it was recommended for girls to keep their armpit hair long. In the meantime, men kept it short in order to make sure it didn’t annoy them in battle with the friction and discomfort that came with it. However, this was an old practice that wasn’t really being followed by younger folks. In essence, it was a culturally familiar joke that anyone, including Shadrach, could make and expect a positive response, whether in the form of a laugh or a playful, friendly frown.\nChapter 28 - The Rise of Nathaniel and the Battle of Factions linkIn the meantime, Nathaniel stared at his apprentices, sitting down. “I lost you guys…” He was referring to his 48 late apprentices. “Yet, this happened. I… don’t know what to do.” It was the first time in a long time that he felt that he truly had no idea what to do.

Though, people knew unpredictable magical interactions could happen if magic was done in a certain way. As mentioned earlier, this was the reason why Goldberg and the late Millie warned the former class of apprentice miners to avoid casting too much magic.\nThe study of magic was continuously growing, and much of it was still in the unknown.\nCertain magical interactions had already been established, but so many more remain unknown.\nThis interaction that killed the Just was one of these unknowns.\nIt was strong enough to bypass the many layers of defences of the Just.\nThe Marchacha goblins’s intention in using the potions and the artifact was to disrupt the opponent’s rhythm and create an opening for even more stronger attacks. Fortunately, they got lucky, similar to almost slipping off a cliff and dying at a hike.\nAfter being hit by over a thousand spells, each a magical meeting between him and over a thousand people, the Just fell to one of the hundreds of ambushes against him.\nHe achieved his goal maybe: the world would reboot again.\nThe next day, on day 22, all around the city, many people were recovering from the aftermath: a processing era.\nAt the bottom of the mountain on which the city stood, at a river, Nathaniel stared at the ground, looking at the hot sun, saying: “I can go months without really taking a break, but I feel I really need it now. Though, I’ve said that many times, often to no avail. It’s hilarious that I even try. But I really do feel shitty. When was the last time I woke up and felt that I was going to be able to make sense of things in a single day? I have no clue. I feel like I’ve convincing myself of all of this. What do you guys think?”\n“Yeah, I don’t know,” said Billy, staring at the river.\n“Yeah, I figured.”\n“Why are we here?” said Notch, alternating between biting an apple and a banana.\n“I don’t know… as well,” said Nathaniel.\n“Seriously. Why are we here at the river?”\n“Billy’s choice. He wanted it.”\n“I mean, why are we taking a stop?”\n“A ‘break’?”\n“Yeah. That.”\nNathaniel smirked with loss. “I haven’t really thought about things, and I need you all to sit down before anything stupid happens again. This entire world is stupid. We’re probably being written here by some piece of crap. I don’t know, people. This sounds a bit fishy—”\nWhen the boys and women around him began to share a suspicious, concerned look with regard to his fatigue and disillusionment, he burst into a guffaw, his laugh resonating for a good while before closing down gradually. It was like the call of a bird soaring above. Soon enough, it would disappear as well.\n“I can’t do this anymore guys,” said Shadrach in a calm manner, staring at his notepad. He was trying to look through his notes, but many of them got wet and smudged. “This is really not great. I forgot what I was supposed to be remembering.” He was talking about his notes, which included his time at the dungeon and the names of the 47 friends, 20 contacts, and 15 enemies that his former class of apprentice miners made during a networking session. “I guess those notes are gone.”\nThose memories were gone, left to the imagination, and so were those people, gone, drifting by along with the river in front of them maybe. What was before 22 days ago before they met Maverick but a dream now?\nThey questioned if they really existed 23 days ago and if Maverick was sent by God to give them new life.\nThey questioned if 4 days ago was a dream, if 10 days ago was a dream, and if 15 days ago was a dream.\nIt could have never happened, as so many things had changed since then.\nThe only reason they felt so strongly about recent days and felt like anything before 22 days ago was a dream was because of how many traumatic events they experienced recently. This gave the feeling that they were not at all a human being that lasted for as long as they lived each.\nTrauma could make someone become a dog, so they asked a question similar to “What is a dog?” as a way to reflect upon their own lives individually.\nThe questioned if their existences could be verified externally and wondered if they were only lying to themselves about everything. If everything could change and be taken away from them so suddenly in the form of sudden, traumatic events, then did they really exist? It was a broad question that they broke down to smaller parts, causing them to reflect upon their memories.\nBut it was too much to process everything, so they picked up a short scene from the past and returned to reality. But the degree in which they remembered varied; the degree in which they reflected varied.\nProcessing their life through externalizing them was not something they could do today. Maybe, they would never fully embrace this.\nIn the end, they were human beings in a magical world, their faces tinged with grief and confusion. It was not physical grief: it was a smile, a skip, a dance, a pointing at the river, a clap, a guffaw, a painting, a note, a speech, a long talk, a walk, and a conversation, among others.\nIt was so exciting to see humans, carriers of so much worth and humanity, be toppled down. The highest satisfaction that one could get from defeating an enemy was by seeing their worth and humanity. Then, it was here that each fallen ally and enemy lived a full life, not numbers on a paper or a bunch of descriptors. They existed, and each of them strived to become fully themselves and yet obedient to the society in which they tend to themselves and those within their community. For a long time, people did as they pleased, but a certain few promised to break out of societal borders and cast their hand upon the throne of being a human being, whatever it meant.\nIn conclusion, despite the nostalgic moments of the past, anything and everything had improved for the better, even if it incurred loss and grief. The only thing one had to do was keep moving forward, as even the act of this was enough for a sense of improvement, even if this very improvement was only in the struggle of the mind.\nTheir struggle was worth seeing because they were human, not because they were representations of humanity, but because they could not be understood, for humanity and the world could never be understood completely as much as the oceans remained to be uncovered. Thus, they could only keep going, even if humiliation and helplessness barelled their way.\nTheir aim was “Keep moving forward.”\nIn spite of and because of everything that happened, Nathaniel and the apprentice miners shared smiles and friendly, humorous, and serious conversations, those of all kinds. It was here that they were one individually—a community.\nRather than Nathaniel being the sole force, the groundwork, the mini-society, he laid involving hundreds of people was re-integrated into the broader social community that included a variety of similar mini-societies. Due to how much was disrupted, many community repair projects was pending and ongoing as part of broader stimulus efforts by the government, which accompanied the liquidity injection to prevent deflation, which depressed demand and economic activity. This made it easier for Nathaniel to return to his personal life, abandoning his mini-society influence in favor of re-integration with societal structures back to their places albeit in addition to reforms in education, security sectors, and governance structures. This was the learning, self-stabilizing process of society. Since the mass massacre of the Just merely validated the need for adventurers, the adventurers focused on restoration, re-integrating pariah adventurers, which comprised both former adventurers and current ones, as postcrisis volunteers. This concerted recession and recovery was possible because the government was keeping their hands off them to encourage spending and investment, aligning with their community projects.\nHowever, instead of a purely inclusive structure, the adventurers still retained some of their exclusivity and barred certain leaders, both former and current, from re-entering, marking a new social order with new canditates to fill the chairs.\nIn the end, thousands of adventurers all across the land were going to experience a change in their makeup, as they would have the navigate on which the Just had painted.\nAs for the Marchacha goblins who “hit the last blow on the Just,” they were sidelined initially, but their actions soon became a talking point among the people of the city, creating uncertainty about their exact role in the Just’s demise.\nMeanwhile, Malkov and Junjirou, the Just’s last friends, stared at the distance, seeing a vision of the Just: he smirked, fading into obscurity. Tears dripped, as Malkov and Junjirou chuckled, their fists hardening. “You shouldn’t have played God, but you lost all the same.” As for the reason he used “but” here, it was to emphasize how futile the Just’s attempt all was. Finally, they meditated on the consequences of overstepping boundaries and attempting to control outcomes beyond one’s grasp: breaking out of societal form.\nBut the Just’s offensive was more than just a simple rebellious act: this was the death of over a thousand adventurers, many of which were the strongest in their units and each a carrier of the shared experiences of numerous communities, tens of group friendship dynamics, and over a thousand of individual friends. These experiences were shattered, leaving a myriad of voids; this close-knit society was damaged as in a punch between giants.\nIn the meantime, Nathaniel oversaw the recovery of 1,000 people thanks to two critical factors. First, his influence with hundreds of people in his local community, established before the Just’s attack, stemmed from his role as an community ambassador leveraging his role as an industry leader. Second, following the attack, he reacquired influence and authority among the hundreds of people from the mini-society that he established during the Just’s attack, which he had initially relinquished over to the government. This plot introduced a layer of postcrisis tension between Nathaniel and the weakened officials on top of the precrisis tensions between him as a mining industry leader and the officials who sidetracked his and relevant stakeholders’ mining advocacy. Despite the tensions, the officials agreed to transition away from adventurers and toward the other sectors. For context, dungeons were at a low enough depth that the currently weakened adventurer sector would find it hopeless to challenge the monsters there. In conclusion, the government would pay more attention to the industry to which belonged Nathaniel, leaving him as among the winners in the post-attack period.\nIncidentally, a significant portion of women were being encouraged temporarily into traditionally male roles in order to compensate for the loss of 15 percent of the population. Coincidentally, the late Millie could have been a good role model for one of them, but this was a sentimental possibility. Speaking of female role models, Priscilla, Goldberg’s partner, was one of them.\nAnyway, to sum up, the Just’s attack damaged society, but it also revealed its underlying structural definitions.\nRegarding a second party in the recovery phrase of the city, in the meantime, Malkov heard a triumphalist orchestra that only he could hear, while Junjirou saw a game-like interface that showed his stats, the shifting population number of the city, and the dynamic density map of the various conversations of the city.\nTo elaborate why Malkov and Junjirou joined the Just, Malkov had an ability that allowed him to hear music in the background that only he could hear. This music followed his circumstances and even allowed him to know the future, as the music would sound ominous when danger was approaching. As for the relation between this music ability and the Just, he first doubted the practicality of attacking a city headon for no reason. However, because he was feeling a strong sense of pride after a successful hunt, which his music ability aggravated, he decided to join the Just. As for Junjirou, he treated the world like a game before he got his game interface ability, and this ability only exacerbated this perception. In conclusion, both Malkov and Junjirou were motivated primarily by perceptions and emotions when they helped the Just who was actually their friend Yesami.\nInstead of pondering the ethical nature of their decisions, they relied on their upbringing of playing street games in order to make decisions, seeing the complexity of decisions within the framework of the great variety of games they played. This was limited, but it was also their lifetimes.\nBut who cared? Why would it be anyone’s business if they were going to be considered “unethical”? They were merely people who made it that everything that they did was within the realm of their everything: they weren’t satisfied with things. But it wasn’t satisfaction that they sought. It was to be a king and legend. It was to fight and war against the gods of this world. They were tired of playing lies, and they would ensure that anyone who crossed their path knew who they were.\nBut Yesami was dead, so they would press on. But they were frustrated enough to want to distract themselves. Since the adventurers didn’t see their faces because they were wearing masks during the Just’s attack, they decided to join the city. In conclusion, they would check things out in the city, blend among the cityfolk, and keep an eye for anything interesting or thrilling.\nNo, it was not good enough. They eased their growing discontent that grew with their processing of Yesami’s death by staring at their hands and seeing the world that their hands offered: violence, pride, victory, and a big world that harkened to their call. They were vulnerable; their childhoods were now\nMalkov looked at a log, imagining it to be Yesami. He wanted to accuse Yesami of making him feel vulnerable. He wanted to sit down and stare at the ground. He wanted to kick it hard.\nHe wanted, but he couldn’t act out anything. He was stuck in a body that didn’t address what he wanted to say. His body was just that strong—too strong even for his mind to take it on as a vessel.\nHe wanted to cry, but he couldn’t admit that because even if he did, what would be the point of it? He had not cried for years. Why would he cry now? He tried so many times before, yet he was just that great and awesome. He was so awesome he couldn’t even cry.\nHe was so honest-to-God great. He was the greatest thing this world had ever seen.\nHe was amazing and possibly all-powerful in a way because he committed to his goals and did everything he could. He was a fighter and a warrior.\nThat was how awesome he was. He smiled.\nIt was that awesomeness where sqeezing out a tear was impossible.\nIt was just impossible, and nothing was going to change that.\nHe couldn’t even fall to his knees.\nHe was too powerful (for his mind to bear). This was how he would do as he willed, which not a single person in this God-damned world would know or understand.\nDelving into a more formal and academic level, coupled with the right portrayal, concomitant emphasis could predicate on four pitfalls: concision bias, the lack of comprehensive data, hasty generalizations, and a desire to confirm established beliefs while engaging in critical thinking only toward opponents, among other more nuanced shortcomings. Moreover, this confirmation bias could present itself as “commonly known facts”: potentially a manifestation of misinformation-related false consensus. Under the aforementioned conditions, anyone could be “evil.” Nonetheless, people could spend so much time gathering information, synthesizing them, and applying them. Even so, research and official, buzz, and folk information, among numerous other context-dependent sources, was limited. With that said, occupying a sweet spot independent from these was the reason why players formed academic communities. As for the primary goal of these partially independent entities, healthy competition took various forms such as debates, conferences, peer-reviewed publications, and collaborative projects. Ultimately, Malkov was a carrier of the labels “heinous monster” and “bestie,” depending on whom you asked.\nChapter 30 - The Weight of Existence linkReturning to Malkov, he was justified in releasing his great wish: to slay the arrogant and invincible who would squeal as soon as they gazed upon their unwanted banal death, the kind fatalistically accepted by those facing extreme poverty and oppression.\nHowever, he was less than the broad wishes that many shared and much more inevitably individual and complex. In other words, his grand wish was a mere utterance; in reality, it was not even a facet of him, as he had lots of temporary space for sand that would drift away in the next wave.\nThe next day, on day 23, Catherine Orlov Sinclair stared at her husband, Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair, who looked ashamed of himself, saying: “Why not be a father and a husband right here and now? Who cares about the truth?”\nNathaniel nodded. “I’m sorry.”\n“Sorry, what?”\n“I’m sorry for not being here… and working overtime.”\n“Yeah, that’s not overtime, is it? That’s you now. You could have chosen not to do it. Yet, you did it. You see what I’m saying?”\n“Yeah. I apologize.”\n“Why are you being so apologetic, all of a sudden? Talk to me.” She sounded threatening.\nNathaniel smiled weakly. “I don’t know. I haven’t really told you, but we went to—”\n“Enough of that. Tell me what you’re apologizing for?”\n“I wasn’t able to correct myself, you know. Just last week, I was… where was I? I was handling the gates, and two days ago, all that. I hadn’t really prepared, so I’m sorry. I know you’re mad about even before the attack, and I wasn’t really making time for you.”\n“Yeah, you weren’t. It’s a good thing I’m telling you here and now. Please don’t let me remind you again.”\n“Yeah, but I’m going to forget to make time and stop extending myself too much and then having to go ahead with the plan anyway even when I should be here with you and the kids.”\nSimultaneously, Catherine said, knowing what he was going to say just by the first few words, “Yes, you are.”\n“Thanks, Catherine.”\n“Ha, ’thank you’,” she mocked lightly. “Don’t… pretend, okay?”\n“I won’t.”\n“But don’t go off the rails either, heh.”\n“Yeah, thank you… thank you.”\nCatherine took on a smile and patted Leroy on the shoulder, shifting to a playful yet overtly disapproving smirk.\nWith Catherine’s conclusion, Leroy decided to head to the other room, attending to his kids with a playful, exuberant attitude.\nCatherine sat near the door, mindfully side-eying him through the doorway. She already spent time with the kids, and she was contemplating on how best to handle finances, the kids’ education, her contacts, her participation in certain events as a speaker, and her connections by promoting their wellbeing, among other various, more specific activities. It was a silent, non-calculative, and relaxed form of dealing with a broad range of challenges as a mother in her capacity. Indeed, she was a “people person,” but she preferred her alone time overall. This was why she was in a room separate from the kids and Leroy at the moment.\nDespite her strong political reign, she lived on the ground in a human capacity, considering her simple, collectivist role.\nThinking about Leroy, she laughed.\nBefore this, Leroy made a joke, so he then thought that Catherine laughed alongside their kids. But she was just laughing at the thought of him.\nEven if they were happy, they grew up in a world that both recognized a level of fatalism but saw, through magic, greatness beyond the acceptance of banality as a part of a good life. This was their struggle.\nIn the end, they would get over it. It was nothing too complicated. A concern about life and all came about often, but it was not anything too disruptive. Merely, it was a part of their good life.\nShifting to a broader level, society was ever-stable.\nRevisiting Charles Finch, he was a part of a nightly defence against monsters. Since his boss John Roger was busy with attending an recovery-directed official session, he and his fellow proxy adventurers was naturally funnelled into the adventurers’ peripheral activities to stay low while securing the “Adventurer” badge, which the adventurer guilds would employ later in transitioning to stable operations. Though, Charles was separate from his fellow proxies and accompanied strangers operating loosely around an adventurer sector.\nFor the official reason behind the defence, 2 days ago, peripheral barriers were temporary relinquished to help the fringe residents, the farmers, evacuate during the Just’s urban attack, so monsters breached through the barriers during this time. Right now, they had to emphasize a quick conclusion. As for the reason of this, the city farmers had to resume farming where they lived at the periphery within the borders. This was critical because it was the latter of two harvest months, and each day increased the likelihood of post-harvest losses.\nNearby, an argument broke out.\n“I desperately despise people like you,” said a world-weary adventurer, Evernight. “Naive and overly-kind. ‘Wanting to make the world a better place’?” He cackled like a monster after years of being treated that way just for expressing his long-suppressed emotions. “I don’t get it. You seriously haven’t gone through anything, have you? Have you seen what it’s like out there? Have you travelled? Met people? You idiot.” Moreover, his voice was calm as if he was stating facts rather than venting.\nThe adventurer he was speaking to, Saddest, stared at him looked anxious for a moment before he furrowed his brows in determination, saying, “I didn’t say anything.”\nSimultaneously, Evernight chuckled. “No, no, you just don’t get it, do you? If you keep speaking like that, you’re going to get hurt, okay? And realize that all you’re doing is nothing.”\nSaddest smiled weakly. “I know what’s that like.” But he never stopped believing in people to his benefit and to his detriment. In this hectic world, he kept going, knowing that he could die later or tomorrow. But when he saw a person, he couldn’t help but feel that that person mattered, especially in a world as callous as this.\nEvernight chuckled again and smirked dismissively. “You’re not realistic.”\nSaddest stared in silence, but his gaze was firm.\nSimultaneously, Evernight thought that he had finally broke Saddest’s naive, overly-kind pride, deepening his smirk. “Just saying.”\nSaddest’s sense of confidence deepened, as he loved people so much that being challenged by them was like a warm hug. He gloated in his helplessness and humiliation, because his internal self-confidence was so strong that he wanted to make Evernight a friend just for disagreeing with him. Despite feeling hurt enough that his eyes became wet, it was as if he knew that this would make what he considered his “arrogance” stronger, not out of insecurity but because Evernight confirmed his beliefs in a way: that people were beautiful.\nBecause of this great sense of beauty, naturally, a deep, endless frustration and motivation hid behind his lips: he would destroy the callousness that killed thousands of people with a violent hand: whatever it took to convince people that beauty existed and people mattered. If communicating with them through conversations, living alongside them as friends, art, music, dancing, singing, and swordplay, among many other modals, was insufficient, his last resort would be to stab them and pray that the fifty-fifty chance of them realizing Beauty (good empathy and a great sense of beauty) for the first time on their deathbed succeeded.\nBefore he left, he briefly sang a funny and singsongy voice to diffuse the tension, especially with the other adventurers standing within earshot.\nWhen he was finally alone, his helplessness and humiliation soon led to tears. Moments later, he made a taut, toothy smile and laughed to cope, reflecting a deep guilt from past complex circumstances.\nHis guilt made him say, “I will become the epitome of grace and beauty.”\nSo he did. After wiping his tears a little, moist-eyed, he went out and prepared with rest of the adventurers against the coming monsters, conversing with other adventurers with a friendly, approachable personality, as he moved nimbly and athletically.\nHe knew who he was, and he would not pretend any longer, gnashing his teeth in victory.\nYet, he wanted to hear himself finally admit it, but he didn’t even have the energy to be angry at himself anymore.\nHe was tired.\nHe said: “Are we a bad person, yes or no?”\nTo answer that question, he had to keep going and assessing himself, even if it might be a Sisyphean task.\nMeanwhile, Evernight looked at the monsters and thought briefly that the image of the blades of the monsters against his throat looked hella comfy today, reflecting what he called a “real” perspective. The sounds of the environment mixed combined with the image hit really hard. He could feel that terrible feeling of the painful realization: that what you were doing was all for nothing. A never ending massacre… just like the point of the phrase: “And realize all you’re doing is nothing.”\nHe, when he was younger, would never comprehend or relate to things like this, but now he was starting to. Peoples’ lives were just an endless loop of meaningless. And even if it concluded to having little pieces of joy, he still felt like his life was truly missing something.\nShifting to the overall level, if only people spoke beyond their words, maybe wars wouldn’t happen. Now, they were a house divided against itself.\nSpeaking of division, especially in the war, Charles Finch only spared Evernight and Saddest a glance, preoccupied with his own concerns, seeing them as mere bystanders in a world full of pretenses. This was why he enjoyed the scenery, because every bit of that stone, in itself, formed a world. Importantly, he was exhausted and stressed from the war, so he might think bad things. In conclusion, he was in a state of disarray, relying on his instincts to move along, sleepy, tired, and anxious, his heart beating like a drum operated by a monkey.\nHis mind was empty, but the complex of niches in which he filled alone, unbeknownst to him, was more than enough. In fact, it was ten thousand years.\nSeconds later, he noticed Evernight saving Saddest with a shot call. This was after Saddest went too far in past monster ranks as an initiator without waiting for the other adventurers.\nBecause they shared a hatred for monsters, in the midst of “Its so over,” they found within themselves an indomitable “We’re so back.”\nMeanwhile, Charles was in the middle of deep thought, finding the backdrop of the monsters a convenient way to feel alone.\nHe couldn’t pretend anymore. Soon enough, he had to face reality. Soon enough, he had to recognize that this world was so big and that he couldn’t comprehend anything. Things were too elusive, ever-changing, ever-dynamic. It was a senseless place to be alive, present in every moment, whether in imagination, in a dream, in a story, in his real-life experiences. He felt a weathering sense that he was being eroded slowly as time went on, not disappearing, just in an ever-continuous state of being eroded. He would never die, and when he did physically, he would live on still, being eroded for eternity. Whether this erosion was the refining of himself similar to that of a metal or the death of his humanity-history, he didn’t know. He sat down patiently, and he should probably have felt afraid, afraid of reality, afraid of his own deep humanity. He was afraid that everything that he knew didn’t exist the way he saw them. Maybe, his perspective was like that of a illusionist’s victim, able to comprehend enough to live but not really comprehending. He didn’t want to downplay magical illusions, but that’s the best way to describe what he felt when he looked at objects and all the memories they possessed or that he ascribed upon them. He did or did not feel. He was there. He was emotive, human, and real. He was a soul, a person, and history. “Whoever saves one life saves the world entire.”\nHe wondered how many “worlds” he had abandoned throughout the years. How many worlds had he failed to save? How many worlds had he failed to document and record? How many worlds had he failed to synthesize into his current dynamic self? How many worlds had he looked at (experienced) and lost?\nHow many lives…\nHe sat down there, and he felt utterly devastated: not depressed or devastated emotionally. But he felt a heavy weight that he could bear, which, in contrast, he felt that he shouldn’t be able to bear. He asked himself when he didn’t feel terrified: “Shouldn’t I feel afraid?” Wasn’t it terrifying? So why wasn’t he afraid? Was he numb? Was he unfeeling or cold like a monster? Was he even there?\nHe should have been crying right then, but he sat down there writing with clarity in his wording. It was utterly devastating, yet he was calm. But he recognized the weight of all of this humanity-history.\nIt was present, and it existed. Yet, he felt fine, reflecting on memories of the past and able to smile and feel okay. He remembered too many things, and he couldn’t pretend not to remember so many things. He didn’t always write them down, and he should have been writing down his day-to-day life. But he needed to focus and do other things as well. He could only extend so much energy into writing in a short period of time. He needed to rest and recover as well, so he refrained from writing and did other things, which was more healthy. But he was left there to feel regret.\nThe past was heavy, yet he was calm. He felt utterly calm, as if he had seen a million worlds, yet he felt calm, even knowing and reflecting. He didn’t remember everything at the moment, but as time passed, he would record and document and reflect. He didn’t think he could pretend anymore. He was ever-systematic in his documentation and autobiographical and diaristic journaling. It was very, very long: a long journey full of sorrows and joys. He was utterly devastated, yet he was relatively calm emotionally. He had nothing to say but all of this. This was an entire world of expression; all of it was.\nWhat did he feel? If he could identify what he felt, had he already lost? Because reality was ever-changing. So any definition came with generalization already. It was impossible to assign definition that considered all the subjective interpretations in order to form a more objective understanding of something, such as what he felt at the moment. It was unidentifiable, unassignable, and unable to be considered. It was outside of his reach yet inside his heart: this emotion was ever-present, yet he could shift his focus toward other things. He was ever-human, ever-consistent, ever-present, yet he was utterly incapable of being defined to a perfectly precise amount. He was utterly void of distinction because the factors for the distinctions that could have been assigned upon him were ever-elusive and unbearably quick so as to be non-existence in his identifying naked eye. He was, but he was not.\nIn his mind, ten hundred people walked around. Each of them lived in an abstract imagination in this head. What did they do? Who did they work for? Why did the “work” need to be assigned upon them? Why did he focus on whom they might work for? Did he believe that work was essential for a human, especially that part of ten hundred people, if this group was one cohesive whole rather than a numbered size of individuals? Was he utterly defiant toward their individuality so as to ask them what their work was and what do they do? What if he didn’t say anything? What if he observed reality and recorded his own findings? What if he asked questions that he thought were common and open-ended enough to get significantly differing answers so as to distinguish between individuals? Either way, he was utterly void of distinction, and so were these individuals who lived in an abstract imagination. But how could he be satisfied with that? Wasn’t distinction the only difference between us and non-existence? Then, if the distinction of existence and non-existence was present, was that solely enough? Then, any other distinction that wasn’t perfectly precise was more of a subjective interpretation rather than a collection of every subjective interpretation so as to form an observable, objective whole. But was that really the case? It made sense or rational, but all of this could just be him: a world where he existed alone. Every world that he created was merely an extension of him. But what of communication, the shared link between individuals and complexes of worlds? Wasn’t that not only an extension of himself but a shared link between multiple individuals and complexes of worlds? Yet, he demanded almost an aloneness in this distinction-making, even if communication did show that sharing this distinction-making was possible and a non-alone act.\nHe was utterly void still of distinction. However, if existence and non-existence were a (binary) distinction and the only one, then he was in existence, and this was solely necessary in the demand for distinction.\nDid he deal with loss this way? But to boil it down and distill it to that felt completely unwarranted. But as that was likely one of the factors, he moved forward, knowing this.\nWas there an answer to this complexity of emotions and concerns?\nWas this how he dealt with the idea of everything he knew, everyone he knew, everything he experienced falling away and disappearing into non-existence and even he, the beholder of all of these and the one that stored all of these memories and experiences, would pop out of existence?\nChapter 31 - The Masks We Wear: Charles and Goldberg’s Inner Battles link Author’s Note\nI apologize for missing a day to upload. To make up for it, two ## Chapters will be released now. The schedule will also now by 8 AM EST. I appreciate your understanding.\nWhen the other adventurers began raising morale by cheering before a second round of fighting with the monsters, Charles wanted to leap in joy. This was because he found out just how important he was again, having suppressed himself in the face of his noble boss, John Roger. This was especially significant since he had magically reverted to a younger man, much younger than his boss, from that of an older man. Here, the blend between the submissive younger man in the face of an older authority figure and the weakened, listless older man led to his suppression. Though, when he was an older man, he was just glad to be alive still, maybe lacking in that ambition, but he was happy to be here on this world.\nThough, elders were respected due to a prevailing culture of filial piety and intergenerational support. However, in his uncommon case, he had lost connection with his support network full of a large variety of communities and his friends within them, his only siblings had passed away, and his late parents had not been the greatest people.\nToday, he would displace his frustrations upon the monsters, knowing full well that he was only indirectly dealing with the issue of a lack of agency and power.\nAt the moment, several event organization coordinators finally got a response from Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair after they contacted him 20 days since. This was relatively fast considering the distance.\nFrom the perspective of a friend of one of the event organizers, Ariella, she was more physically present than her organizers. In contrast, her title was that of “Sister.” Like “Brother,” it was a simple title for those active in the church network.\nBased on the combined knowledge of the organizers, they belonged to a denomination of local churches from a large variety of districts all around the region, and their concerns encompassed the management of events with respect to the various participants from all around the districts, ensuring constant connection through magical long-distance forms of communication such as “clairvoyance”, which pushed a mage’s senses to another irrespective of distance, and in-person general assemblies.\nOften, events became hubs of communication as well as lengthy discussion that lasted from 10 AM in the morning up to 9 PM. This carried the expectation for attendees to stay for multiple days around the venue city or, on the other hand, travel long distances early in the morning through portals, flying rides, and other forms of travel. Though, any magic-powered conveniences, such as portals, and amenities, like antiemetics that alleviated acute portal nausea, was frequently situated on the higher end of the price spectrum, certainly not for the budget-conscious.\nIn the end, the aforementioned concerns were basic knowledge to them. More broadly, their challenges covered regularly visiting local churches all around for local church events as a speaker and contacting representatives from these churches and pooling information between them to preserve and foster ongoing liaison between regional and more narrowly focused district council representatives and local churches, or, due to their strong and collaborative relationship, stakeholders. This was harder than it looked because, geographically, the region was a mess. It was not full of straight, even highways. Rather, it was a literal rainforest, also frequently involving a walk through the urban jungle to arrive at a church.\nIncidentally, as part of a broader departure of magical behavior and category of thought from ecologism or the “focusing on taking care of the plants” magic toward utilitarian essentialism, anthropogenic activity, such as selective tree cutting, was increasing, disrupting the natural habitats of flora and fauna in the rainforest.\nAnyway, at the moment, Ariella was pondering her rationale and the reason for why she was doing any of what she was doing and working so hard. Seeing the city from a high place, she felt a strong sense of purpose, as she could feel the weight of her accomplishments start to bark at her behind her back and all around her.\nTransitioning to a vivid and metaphorical level, with everything that had been going on, she could slowly sink her energy into remembering the past, each ounce of her heart being placed into the duty of massacring completely the sense that she was powerless and weak. The momentary pauses in her breath, each a determined thought that could pass through her lips into the open air in the incarnation of segments of a monologue, danced throughout the tips of her tongue, as if waiting for everything’s breath to come about. Sunshine or death, the morning rose, breathing life upon the earth and calling upon her name, seeking out her presence and tending tenderly to her needs and functions. She was a robot. Sunshine or death, the morning called her name, tenderly placing her on its lap and guiding her toward strictly placed regimented waters wherein she was at peace. This order and the chaos implied in the word “waters” kept her afloat mentally until she overcame her grief.\nShe waged a war upon the earth, her endless reign amounting ultimately to little, as this reign transitioned into the weakness of her flesh and the tiresomeness of her bones. She longed, but she was completely unfounded in her reasoning that she was alive, well, and even free to impart her impact unto the world.\nShe sundered the weapon. She bifurcated the seams of her being, the flesh like ridded wet, spoiled rags, each ounce of her becoming the epitome of glory (beauty and the flesh), dancing upon this earth, weaving her glory upon this earth. She was the weapon of the heavens, her glory reigning mightily upon this earth. But that was merely an expression, for she was an infidel, a broken, tired girl singing the song of a woman. “Let them all fall” was her saying. Let them all fall.\nThe bifurcation of her being was a branching out of the beauty inherent in her being. This nature of hers was merely an abstraction, as she, who was non-abstract and realistic, was ever-growing and evolving, turning, tearing, searing, singing, dancing, loathing, breathing heavily and deeply, flesh-gripping, sun-embracing, love-toiling, and great. She was the epitome of grace upon this earth!\nWaiting outside, she watched herself, asking herself: “Where are you, Ari? Where are you?” Her voice was weak in tone and weight, but it was strong mentally. From her voice came the greatness of man. She was the epitome of grace, and they shall all find out that they are too. It was grace that graced them all in between the weaknesses and simultaneously sundering into the flesh, imprinting onto dry bone—ever and ever more.\nIt was with grace that she was. It was with grace that she was freedom. It was with grace that she would forever swathe this earth with her glory. It was with grace that… she was heavenly touch. Being of all nature. Being of all queens. Sunshine or death, she was come.\nReturning to reality, she held back her sense of greatness, as she now had to act rationally. But both of these characteristics were facets of her. If she wasn’t so self-aware, she would lose her position and become a trembling beggar, writhing, crying out loud without shame.\nIn the end, she wasn’t one to waste her time barking, as she was here with a goal, and any part of herself needed to line up wherever they could, because she was going to make things work and keep them working. If anyone stopped her, they would be facing a woman.\nMaybe, she was assembled differently as a woman, but it was just that simple: that was reality, and she had to make the most out of it. Whoever had anything to say, they were going to say it not to anyone else but her. Her conditions for criticism included the statement: “Not an open letter, not an indirect message out there for people to see, not gossip behind doors, but if anyone wanted to say anything, I’d like to see hands and feet outside in front of me in person. It would be funny seeing you try.” Because if she was going to get hit, she wanted to show the world how hard it was to keep going even after the initial hits. Maybe, on her third try, those critics would get the come-around. Like most people who spoke publicly, she said the hard truths. When she did, people cried wolf.\nIndeed, she was a “wolfess.”\nNoticing her sense of significance flaring up again, she went down to ground level on the streets to stamp it.\nNext to her, Goldberg looked around, feeling the weight of his hands, as he strolled along the road, his back a mountain, his arms curving like a serpent-entwined rod, a weight of rage embued through his movements. Growing up, he was called a monster. Being born a big, male baby, this trend of masculinity continued onward despite his kind, simple, and shy personality partially stemming from a non-confrontational, avoidant mother. As a result of this trend, others began addressing and treating him as they would with regard to a man beset by a male-dominated adventurer culture, pigeonholing him into the controversial identity and role of a monster-beset man. Moreover, because of the dismissive culture toward adventurers by certain groups, especially women, he began to fulfill the prophesy that they told of men, such as him: in terms of demeanor, he became an example of the “predator man” stereotype. In the end, his rage became a helplessly accepting toothy grin. This visually represented a strong confidence that unconsiously, strongly hid a history of cognitive dissonance between a kind, simple, and shy boy and the predator man.\nShifting to a broader future, he would become the monster they thought he was, and he would fulfill the duty they had thrusted upon him, because he was just an normal man. Second, he was nothing, reduced to mere gossip fodder with respect to how horrible predator men were. Lastly, he would hide his emotions, and he would die never expressing himself because he was fodder, only perfoming what he was expected to do and be, his humanity devastasted, internalizing the hatred toward predator men, like him.\nTransitioning to his more personal anger, the possibility of having his individiuality unpotentiated made him want to express himself. In the past, he would cry, but because his trauma-related neurotic concerns were dismissed and even relished by those who hated predator men, he now expressed himself the way he had been taught: violent, predatory rage. Now, he was the expected predator man, and he would enact his “great kindness” upon them, pressing them to continue onward and make a decision. He would because he wanted, and he would seize them by the throat and crush them, embracing them with his love as their blood drooled down his shoulders and back. This was his innate name.\nWhen he wanted to help others by talking to them softly in the past, he now expressed himself through violent fantasies and doing his job as a predator man, an adventurer specifically.\nHe wasn’t even sure if his violence was a mere act or who he truly was, but he never really truly processed his past, having used adventuring as a way to explore himself even if he preferred living a simple life at one point. Now, he was ambitious because that was what the predator man was supposed to be. This cause-effect didn’t happen linearly, as it was a dynamic history of ups and downs and back-and-forth progression, full of identity formation and reflective day-to-day living. If he wanted to stop truly, he would give up all the energy and resources he had spent toward conforming, and this was who he was now. In the end, he was nothing, and his life was so full. Yet, his life was now rendered to be a role: the adventurer one saw down the street like every other adventurer. Instead of reflecting and focusing on exploring himself and his personal goals and desires, he conformed, leaving him as a personally unfulfilled married man in his forties. This was why he was so individualistic in terms of ideals yet also herbivory in the domain of assertiveness.\nIn short, the conformity to the adventurer archetype, instead of exploring personal goals and desires, left him personally unfulfilled.\nYet, in a way, he didn’t necessarily hate adventuring: he loved it and found a home there, coming back to it not only because it was a job but because he felt at ease returning to it subsequent to each break. Still, he felt dehumanized as an adventurer and wished to enact his more individualistic ideals. In conclusion, it was a love-hate relationship, one so fun that he was addicted yet so bad that he criticized it at every turn.\n(End of the First Arc)\nChapter 32 - A New Beginnning linkTo start, a young man watched several dogs walking around. He saw Billy, Notch, and Shadrach walking around in the lower-income neighborhoods. They looked like the rest of the thousands of people currently walking around the city. Even in this giant monolith of a city, the cracks representing the diverse groups thrived, prospered, and bloomed.\nElsewhere, several killers hiding among the populace walked around, observing Goldberg as he accepted several different ritualistic attachments upon his skin in order to enchant himself. This was somewhat in the middle of the city with crowds forming. Even now, he caught attention, having been the glory-hog that officials and adventurers used to avoid having to credit the Marchacha goblins and the other prisoners. In conclusion, Goldberg became a hero of the city. Incidentally, his children Nash and Leia were eating food nearby, talking excitedly about adventuring, mages, and magic.\nIn another place, hundreds of wild dogs belonging to more complex social structures roamed around, sighting the hundreds of beasts of labor belonging to the Marchacha goblins. With help from some of the city council members, they were able to buy fodder from a premium exclusive noble-oriented marketplace.\nMeanwhile, a bird sighted the forms of a team of John Roger’s proxy adventurers. They stood in two separate lines, flanking Charles Finch as he entered the cave toward a dungeon core. As for Mary, Elizabeth, Sarah, they were busy helping out with city recovery efforts, representing John Roger with his color theme, banners, and various official symbols. When it came to James Boulevard, he was helping out in keeping an eye out for John Roger’s laborers, but he also led them, being a favorite of John.\nIn many different places, numerous people rushed to get food supplied by Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair, having seen his inviting makeshift signs at the entrance of several churches. In the vicinity of these churches, Saddest, Evernight, and other adventurer parties were helping hand out food, keeping the peace. Moreover, he was in collaboration with several event coordinators. Several adjutants of his were assigned to assist these coordinators with their concerns about the Marchacha goblins, who had just left.\nSimultaneously, a dispersion of rats poured into the noble estates of the city, passing through villages, manors, farmland, rainforests, large areas of land, a nearby lake, and other buildings and infrastructure. They once sighted John Roger standing at the top edges of his fort, who made plans to return to operations after the Just. He was just as slow as the other nobles, all of whom had focused on making sure that all their operations were done to refocus efforts toward protecting and removing their resources in case the Just did succeed.\nFar away, a group of lumberjacks re-entered the residential areas of the city, having been late to learn of the Just’s attack. They saw Billy, Notch, and Shadrach’s fellow apprentice miners in the vicinity of their homes. To clarify, these miners included Ethan, Sophia, Noah, Liam, Alexander, Oliver, Ava, Jackson, Benjamin, and Nathan.\nFurthermore, various groups in power, which included Priscilla and Catherine Orlov Sinclair and other people like them, were taking part in helping out with recovery efforts, keeping tabs on as much people as possible, especially regarding pensions for the elderly and disabled poor. Indeed, as the spouse of a mining industry leader, despite the tensions between her husband and the John Roger adventurer-favoring side of the aristocracy, Catherine contributed in small part to relaxing the caps and eligibility requirements of these pensions.\nBeyond the horizon of the city, several hunters and other workers keeping an eye out around the city as per usual, especially post-crisis, sighted Malkov and Junjirou, both of whom disappeared through a portal. These two had confirmed that they already were done with everything here.\nIn addition, with the skills she gained as a friend of event organizers, Ariella was helping out preaching efforts in the city square, supplementing the food hand-outs by churches from a different denomination. This was especially given to compromise since churches all had different interpretations of their religious texts.\nAlso, inside a small cave den close to the surface and perforated with holes serving as windows, a handful of goblin babies saw the form of the goblin necromancer who helped kill 30 adventurers from Charles’ group under John Roger.\nFarthest from the city, a girl with diligence, a talent in fire magic, and parents with connections to noble-adjacent people emerged from a tiny school building, an older magic teacher accompanying her out. The street were filled with magically-trained children aged 4 to 12 years old wearing white and red banners on their backs as the school’s tradition and culture.\nAt the city gate John Roger had started rebuilding, many of the workers were starving and thirsty, having been told to wait for John to return. However, in the meantime, the Just had attacked, and no one told them. They heard the sounds of battle, but they didn’t want to disobey John. However, they were already getting too tired of waiting. So they would leave a few minutes from now. Fortunately, Sinclair’s miners had already left. It was a little disorganized, but John hadn’t left one of his men to keep an eye on them. So it was expected that even some of the workers would disobey the order, especially given the Just’s attack.\nAround the city, various laborers, including Inframark and his brother, observed the looming, vast, and call-filled rainforest jungle, accompanied by Sprutnoa, who didn’t make the Just’s attack his problem enough to quit his job like many others.\nIn the verdant forest directly connected to the city via Northe Road (or, in goblins’ terms, “Multa”), a group of five talented young mages observed a monster in the form of a chest on four spider-like legs and the two humanoid demons accompanying it.\nWhile several monks were walking through the streets with caution in the city grounds, they noticed a group of diversely clothed protégés. After a glance, they discovered the goblin trinkets hanging by their weapons, bags, and clothes, widening their eyes with admiration. After a short conversation between themselves, the monks began a discussion characterized by a more sophisticated lean with these protégés. Soon, they learned that the goblin trinkets were bought from a thousand goblins that had founded a settlement. Since both the monks and the protégés belonged to a secret society and it was against the society’s principles to avoid interacting with goblins, the protégés reached a pay settlement with the monks, the protégés having expected this.\nSpeaking of which, the settlement of goblins were going through their first wave of monsters, having weakened their fortifications in order to bait the enemy to attack earlier before their forces more fully mobilized.\nMoreover, several women hurried inside the back of a church, preparing for festivities, expecting an adventurer group. This was the same group Nathaniel had hired to help Shadrach for several days.\nAs for the network of 47 friends, 20 contacts, and 15 enemies created by Billy, his current fellow apprentice miners, and his former ones, it had become dormant, waiting until further notice.\nAs for deceased parties, they included the Just, Millie, Maverick, a portion of his fellow laborers, 48 of the apprentice miners of Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair, the marginalized adventurers who attacked citizens, the many adventurers who lost their lives against the Just, the goblin messenger killed by Goldberg, and the 30 adventurers belonging to John Roger, who were killed by the goblin necromancer, among many others.\nToday was day 23.\nBilly and his fellow apprentice miners were made to wait a week before Nathaniel would gather them again.\nWith that said, the ambitions of other relevant parties continued to be cultivated and explored with their growing unique lines of development.\nFirst, Nathaniel stood inside a building, watching from the edifice. “I can’t bear to watch these people being so weak. It’s tiring. Boring! I have to make sure that they grow beyond their limits. They must become everything.”\nSecond, Charles gritted his teeth, staring down the dungeon core, plunging his hands into it and inheriting the great power of the dungeon, transforming into it. He wanted to become the epitome of great power.\nThird, Goldberg felt a biting pain, as he was berated and insulted by the officials. They had created a hero out of him, but now, they mocked him and treated him as if he was lesser. But it was the officials who embraced adventurers that saved him from further castration. With this newfound support, as a hero, he dared to do great things, continuing his conversation with the Marchacha Goblins, with whom he had a complex relationship.\nFourth, In one meeting between him and them, Kahul and the rest of the Marchacha Goblins raised a toast and made sure he was adequately welcomed. They wanted to bring the downfall of human superiority, but they needed reliable humans to respond in tandem—breaking the monolith from the outside and the inside. This was divide and conquer.\nReturning to the moment, Billy watched the fulminating rain storm of the sky, his heart beating quietly. After being adjacent to a world and people echoing with big, wide-reaching, and grandiose statements, ideas, concepts, symbolisms, and explorations, he merely appreciated the distractions of his environment, being an unstudied and uneducated observer. Many would say that it was because he was this unknowledgeable that he was able to enjoy the world as it was. To illustrate this concept metaphorically, the nerve representing Billy’s unadulterated perspective was divided by maturity, leaving the artery and vein intact. Following this, trauma (stimulation) no longer produced an increased secretion of wonder. But this was only according to the concept that pre-maturity exclusively held the pronounced benefit of awe. In the end, the environment itself, even without formal education, presented an art piece lavishing experiencers with endless growth.\nBilly’s desire to relax and focus on living in the present was mirrored by the current landscape, as many adventurers who had lost much in the attack were now unable to receive loans due to the tighter underwriting standards of treasuries. Basically, they required higher credit scores, especially particularly adapted to adventuring. As a result of the crisis, now, adventurers were being pushed into a much smaller capacity, most of them having their specializations robbed from them and their time and energy thrust toward daily-basis work, or day labor, negligibly tailored by their unique experience and skills. This happened in concert with an increase in homelessness among adventurer veterans. In a broader, more relevant way, this emerged as a socioeconomic issue of the big prices senior monster-dealing adventurers paid in the aftermath of the crisis. This led to a rise in the need to live slower and forget ambitions and focus on recuperating in unison. In more associatively sensational terms, this was the large-scale displacement of adventurers due to the massive loss of adventurers during the Just’s attack.\nMoreover, since adventurers were predominantly male, women were the ones left behind by the loss of adventurer life, so they had more power here while also shouldering the aftermath of the crisis. The accompanying policy reviews would lead to a broader increase in democratization and increased power among women. However, an absolute monarch could single-handedly shut this down depending on their personal beliefs. But for better or worse, the current city-state was an aristocratic monarchy.\nAnyway, returning to adventuring, it was still going strong, with many nobles like John Roger continuing to sponsor dungeon expeditions. This was why even now, Goldberg lowered his head in front of the officials who mocked him, hoping to capitalize on his newfound status. If he dared make a scene now, he would lose all respect and his reputation would be tossed to the ground.\nInvestigation and accountability were launched in response to questions raised about the circumstances that had led to the crisis and whether adequate measures were taken to protect the adventurers’ lives.\nBut in the end, it didn’t matter what happened.\nBilly desperately reverted focus to his present, removing his straying thoughts.\nThe present was sufficient to establish himself in this new era.\n“We begin,” he said, holding a small vace and carrying inside his home. His house had grown in size, and this was with the help of Nathaniel. Since infrastructure was changing, Billy’s home was one of many homes that had become repurposed for the city’s recovery. This was why Billy was bringing water.\nEventually, he gave the repurposed vace to a haggard man with scars across his chin and lips; his clothes were disheveled; his arms were stiff with bandaged injuries; and his eyes, which had been bright with hope, were disillusioned.\nShifting to others like the haggard man, around him, many others lay still or sat down with their arms awkwardly resting against their bodies or the floor. Moreover, the wounded were a crucial resource, and Billy’s role here was indispensable. To conclude, Nathaniel made sure that people were aware of that role structure.\nSauntering to a matter of metaphorical importance, within Billy’s physical smile, a timely drip of rainwater was opening up a grand line of a hurricane of peoples from across the land.\nChapter 33 - Forging New Paths: Adapting to Change in the City’s Recovery linkFamiliar groups and individuals maintained their direction and focus despite the challenges a recovering city entailed.\nBilly, Notch, and Shadrach were set to expand into mining more. Even if it was complex, Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair streamlined his operations and delegated enough that the boys could finally get into it.\nThis was a big development for them, since the recent events had become too overwhelming to return to normal life. They hoped that this mining training would restore their sense of balance. This was their new normal.\nWhen it came to Goldberg, he was already finished with his concerns, having disappearing into the challenging role of a hero. He was no longer seen in person by his previous connections: the prisoners he had befriended, the Marchacha goblins, the apprentice miners, including Billy, Notch, and Shadrach, and Nathaniel. However, he kept in touch with his family: his wife, Priscilla; his son, Nash; and his daughter, Leia.\nCharles was still beginning to explore his new powers, but the demands of the new authority occupying the adventurer guild seats were draconic to be the backbone of the recovery of the city. So his position and the powers he gained from the dungeon core would be a pillar of this recovery.\nNow, with these characters entering new sections of their lives, delving into their perspectives without a break would no longer yield increasing returns, as their environment had made up the primary yield. Maverick, who was the first mentioned at day 1, was a good example of this, a man whose life kickstarted various waves across his city, but he was not alive to witness it. It was his stimulated environment that demonstrated the greatness of his existence and not him on his own. To conclude, the perspective of one of the young powerful travelers currently navigating to the city would prove distinct, albeit serving as respite.\nHe had little political or philosophical goals, but it was his simple perspective that brought life to the darkness of the shadows of the city monolith.\nHe began cutting trees, collecting various logs at a small fishing town. His goal was to keep his focus and his axe sharp. With this, he would remind himself everyday of the coming wave of goblins that he was told would arrive 17 years from now. He felt that it was too little time for him to prepare, expecting to reach a strong enough level of strength 30 years later. This was why he was serious about meditating in moments like these, because he had to be consistent.\nHe cut down another tree, making sure to use magic to plant another tree. The magic facilitated his forraging process, as it made planting instantaneous. It was a power that he felt only he had.\nAnd that was why he was responsible.\nAfter pushing the logs on top of each other and piling them up, he looked around, hoping to survey his current landscape.\nHe was still outside the city gates, but he planned on living here anyway, remote.\nHe cut down two trees just now. He had 15 logs already, and that was a lot. But magic guided him, so he wasn’t too troubled.\nHe took 5 hits to cut down one of the trees, and the trees weren’t all that thick.\nHis goal was to clear the jungle, since it was a dense tropical rainforest. So slash-and-burn agriculture made the most sense right now.\nBut vegetation was very stubborn, and it would a very, very long time before anything visually conclusive would be seen.\nHowever, in the meantime, he was training his foraging.\nThe night was cold, and nothing seemed to bother him.\nBut he always hid those past events deep in his heart—the afterimages of a long life.\nAll the images liberally flashed through his mind.\nAt night, it was difficult to sleep, but when he did, he was finally okay.\nHis life, when compared to so many people, had little use other than to work.\nHe knew that.\nBut he still wished to make a difference, or maybe that was also what made his life just one of many—the fact that his life would add its slice to the pie that was the world, but never to the point of superiority.\nHe lay down, resting his head, pushing his back against the nearest rock for support. He didn’t know what else to do.\nYet, he knew what felt like more than everything he could ever contain in his little mind of his. It was a vast world that he was living in, and the everyday silences bothered him sometimes. But he learned how to deal with it.\nMaybe, that was the perks of a long life. It still hurt. He just learned to manage it, and now he could confidently say that he would rather be here than be back there in the past when things were tumultuous and chaotic. He didn’t want to live in a lie, so whatever thoughts his child self spun he discarded.\nHe didn’t want to lay here for too long.\nHe stood up and began working, his everyday existential thoughts making no difference for anybody else but him.\nShifting to his name, honestly, he didn’t need a name. He would take the name “Nameless” any day or some common name that didn’t provide any insight to who he was or where he came from.\nHe was Nameless.\nBut he would rather not even be seen to be anything.\nHe was discardable.\nThat was why he had to strive to protect people, even if in the grand scheme of things, humans were already dead.\nHe had to fight and live in the moment.\nHe struck a tree, making sure it knew who was striking it. He didn’t want to be striking trees without his heart, soul, and mind in the action. He needed everything he did to be purposeful and intentional, lest he lost the only thing that made him him—the capacity to be here now as the person he currently was.\nHe wasn’t even a male being.\nHe was nameless, genderless, and lacking in an identity. The only thing he was was a human being, and even that was in question.\nHe was nothing.\nBut the sparks of a younger life called for him to become everything.\n“I have to…” said his younger self when he was fighting a giant orc amid friends: Dani, Lesrob, and Robyn.\nHe cried at the present. He had lost his friends, his family, and his soul. Who was he now!\nHe said: “I am nothing… I have to be. If I am something, then the weight of the guilt and the expectations will upend me and bring me away from here to… what place? I don’t know.”\nHe had lost so much.\nHe fell to his knees and begged the earth to swallow him up. “Eat me! Take me away! I am unhindered! I am weak! I am faulty! And I am unable to be divine! I am a meek soul breeding horror again and again with my simplicity. With these daily motions, I am utterly incapable of love. I am a stranger to that window that calleth after me—it reminds me of the past. That I cannot change it breaks my resolve.”\nHe was lonely, but he was not a man, a person, or a human being.\nHe was drifting straight into oblivion—The Gates of Hell. The Terror of Hades. The Gone-For-Good Place.\nHe would finally die once this was all over. But not yet.\nHe wanted to rest and sleep with his beloved, those people whom he called brethren and friends and lovers. He lost so many children over the years, having been tossed and turned by the world and monster and evil.\nHe was gone.\nBut his fingers, hands, arms, and his entire body tasted the earth and rejuvenated in him a capacity for pain and an understanding of the ground that he was on right now.\nHe was present.\nHe wanted to disappear and become a ghost.\nHe would not become special.\nHe would get what he wanted.\nTransitioning to the city, Billy looked around, finding himself in a bit of a pickle. The mining operations were going well; however, he was just tasked to go deeper into the dungeon. So since he was a little worried about goblins after seeing the Marchacha goblins in person, he invited Robert, the boy who loved the darkness, to help him.\nRobert raised his hands over his head and pretended to be a ghost, making high, childish strides forward. “Let’s go! Woohoo! If I see one of them, I’ll give them a peekaboo! Alright!” He was referring to the goblins.\nBilly said: “Hey, don’t actually say that. I’m worried, you know. The game and stuff. All around. I’ve been seeing so much of them, so I don’t know… You know?” He was scatter-brained, and he was also scared right now.\nWhen they turned a corner, they were surprised to see a eye-singer staring back at them.\nBilly and Robert made a run for it, because its chirp made their targets’ eyes burn.\nThe eye-singer chirped, and Billy and Robert were immediately affected.\nBut they knew the way out, using their hands and striding high and wide to keep their balance and know-how around the cave tunnel.\nFortunately, the eye-singer didn’t follow them, so they were good to go. After returning, they continued to mine the blocks, upping their experience overtime.\nBilly, Notch, and Shadrach, and the older apprentice miners like Robert were under a new trainer.\nThe trainer was simple and wasn’t particularly skilled, but not too much of an eye-sore. He was the type that was hired due to an enterprise structure that prioritized loyalty rather than skill.\nIn the end, Billy was happy that Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair had moved from being the apprentice miners’ trainer to one of the leaders of the recovery effort, since Billy generally trusted Nathaniel’s judgement from their previous time together.\nAnyway, when it came to their mining effort and the progression of the eye-singer, Shadrach played a role by drawing mini-maps and writing down notes. Earlier, Billy brought up Shadrach’s skill as a note-taker, and the trainer encouraged this.\nBilly followed up on this by engaging in note-taking himself, inviting Notch to do so as well. Notch agreed.\nTheir follow-up enabled Shadrach to organize since Billy and Notch served as two replicators for him to consolidate knowledge.\nTheir skill set as a group now included mining and note-taking, but they previously demonstrated coordination even without these specific skills. Not just coordination, they cross-coordinated with the other apprentice miners on one occasion at least, especially since the incident that had taken 48 apprentice miners’ lives. And their experience as teenagers who had grown up actively interacting within a tight lower-income part of the city yielded them sociocultural finnesse.\nEventually, several adventurers entered the cave, waving at the apprentice miners’ trainer. They were his friends.\nAfter talking to the trainer for a while and asking how he was going and about future plans together, they left, heading to the adventurer guild.\nAt the guild, various chairs and tables were strewn around the room, as various parties sat down and invited others comfortably and casually. The guild was bright, and a group of musicians and singers used a microtonal and melismatic style in a relaxing tone. Dancers were also engaging in this repetitive, spasmic movements.\nThis guild had bred its own distinct community enough that all kinds of adventurers hanged out, including unique individuals with eye-catching armor, weapons, pets, or artifacts.\nAs for the several adventurers who were friends of the trainer, they played a smaller role compared to the other adventurers, being part of a larger rabbit extermination team within the guild. The guild was separated into divisions, but when it came to the smallest regular tasks like rabbit extermination, they assigned it to a team.\nThe several adventurers were part of a party named “Shunabi,” and the rabbit extermination team was acronymed “RBT.”\nThese adventurers would never encounter people like Charles Finch, who was located on a much different kind of level within the adventurer guild, a much different role, and a much different side branch of the guild.\nSo they provided a sight into the more urban side of things, participating in quests that were only days away from the city. Charles Finch’s quests were much farther and involved areas that had much less residential infrastructure and concerned a centralized, more forward-operating base of operations. However, it was complex, and it was simple as just a single remote base. Certain trade routes of certain goods traveled through here, so this place, in a complicated manner, was still connected to the city. But Charles Finch and the base operated peripheral to larger objectives of this location such as handling other nobles’ building-sized magical artifacts. This didn’t include John Roger’s gate, but it was an important strategic location. But even that lay peripheral to broader considerations such as the way adventurer items were exchanged. It was a part of the city’s priorities to maintain the ease in which adventurers could liquidate their items, so they invested most of their funding into a list of enhancements to the backed-up structure—mostly having to do with regulation, appraisal, training, new magic integration, academia collaboration, responsible stewardship, and international collaboration.\nAnyway, the adventurers of Shunabi entered a quest, watching the clouds.\nAfter sighting a single rabbit, they immediately revealed their hand, striking the goblin down with multiple arrows, rogue dashes, and sweeping sword attacks. When the rabbit leapt away, an army of rabbits emerged.\nA spear from behind struck the rabbits, causing a panic.\nThe swordsman kept slashing, breaking them down in waves.\nThe archers shot stray rabbits, causing a sense of panic to stand out, pushing against each other to find cover and ruining their momentum.\nThe rogue located the rabbits who escaped and neutralized them.\nHowever, many of the rabbits still escaped.\nThis was how they operated, and it was normal.\nAscending to a broader perspective, this city continued to hum springly into the day and gently into the night, denoting the hwah (inhale) and whoooosh (exhale) of its lifeblood. The next days would continue to involve the characters’ reinvention of themselves as they proceeded into the new era. And intensity would build gradually.\nChapter 34 - Evolving Paths of Billy, Notch, and Shadrach. link Author’s Note\nI apologize for the 62-min delay and for missing out the day before. To compensate, I will upload a double ## Chapter in the future, maybe tomorrow. I appreciate your understanding.\nBilly moved again, strengthening his resolves, his pickaxe strking unhurriedly against the cold stone. His eyes bursting with color, he rubbed them to prevent his imagination from leaking out via murmurings. At night, he walked out, finished with his training, accompanied by friends like Notch, Shadrach, and the other apprentices.\nWhatever people expected from him would be finished, because Billy was quick on the move. And the person he was before was lesser than the more responsible and reliable person he was now. So he could commit to personal and more formal tasks because people really didn’t think he was so capable so as to burden him too much. It was hard being an 18-year-old among younger boys, but that allowed him to focus on taking it easy and slow. If time had problems with him, he would listen. But right now, he could gloat in his silence; not a single touch of work stress taking him alive and beating him sorely.\nThe people were expecting Notch to be a lot more respectful his eyes having seen plenty of things. It was hard being in a new world where socializing wasn’t the main priority. Now, it was all about helping each other and cooperation. Talk was merely the tool to assist and support. It was no longer about hierarchies and balances of power. It was still there, but it didn’t concern Notch emotionally and among his support structure. Those he concerned himself with only allowed him to be respectful instead of that spunky boy that he used to be, who always managed to get ahead compared to his friends when it came to getting authorities on his side and giving him treats. He cared about how chicken made him look cool because others thought it was too expensive, but how could he express that care now that this world was turned upside-down? People wanted him to be responsible and respectful. That was all. But he found that to be incredibly unfair.\nShadrach was a writer, but the words he held to heart were few.And he could only adjust each letter each time he incorrectly wrote one. It was a balance of patience and knowing the greatness that lay behind the documentation of words, memories and characteristics of times past. He saw the past through the letters that he wrote, being more of an artist than a writer of comprehensive history. But that was fine. His simply worded reports always amused his betters at work. He now worked as an apprentice miner, and the trainer there really wanted him to press his luck as a writer. He listened; thus, he became the trainer’s best candidate for mining administration.\nBut Shadrach wanted more than that. Billy wanted more than what he had. Notch never wanted things to change.\nTheir child (or young) states were important, even if the details might reveal themselves at one point to be altogether unimportant.\nMoving on to another perspective, At the town houses on which divine inspiration flowed down generationally, five young men looked around, their faces in constant up and down, as their lips became tied together with cursory expressions. In front of them, one of them was a particularly tall man staring upon the wider landscape of Antipolo City, the place where Billy, Notch, Shadrach, and almost everyone else previously mentioned lived.\nThese men were nonnoble and recently ennobled merchants, lawyers, and state bureaucrats, and they had become preoccupied with the vast sums of wealth they had accumulated and then lost in the Just’s attack.\nSubmerging focus into their viewpoint, they belonged to a large city empty of its people and only fulfilling the job of tearing down familial pursuits, those of maintaining professional branding with respect to a family. This was why they were scared to fight against the wave that would soon be coming—people from all around the region would be coming here to visit what was supposed to be the grand opening of a new villa district, where all those who sought the “red lights” of adventurerdom were free to peruse and to create for themselves a brand new refuge. That villa district was theirs. However, the Just had ruined all that, causing grief upon grief to pile up like breads being turned over and in half by cutlery. This was the end of all things and the start of something new, for one of them, the tall man of grand esteem, whose eyes embraced the landmarks of the city, was inclined to tear away all the obstacles in their way. He stated: “Let us create bread, my friends, and remove this world and make it anew. To do this, we have to make sure that the city recognizes our footing in its success. But we need the adventurers’ help!”\nA bureacrat among them said: “Oh, but the adventurers’ guild had changed. The new controllers have taken root and have shunned the idea that they might benefit the lazy pauper, whose dirty hands, touted to be so hardworking, would clean and repair all by themselves if they were truly so! I am not saying so as to discourage us from success. But I am warning that the controllers standing upon the seats and the gates will not permit any consideration toward the benefit of foreign travelers and migrants from afar lest we ourselves put our hands to the laboring pen!”\nThe tall man answered: “That is a natural subsequent to our challenges, but we arise like doves on a Sellas’ day. We are like maidens running about with no end in sight, with no end in sight. We shallowly move our feet, tearing the wood planks that keep us secure. This way, we are but free birds in a broadleaf evergreen-laden glade.” He urged the other young men, who were called the “New Men,” to seek the hardship of work in order to be as true as a nightly gown presented everyday to the newly ennobled members among them.\nHe continued, concluding their lengthy discussion: “Let us partake then in our ceremony that we may show anger toward our oppressors—the monsters and the rulers that send them to us as invaders.”\nMoving on to Billy, he mined the cave, continuing down the path of thought and peace. Since people expected him to become a superior boy within a shy age of 18 years old, he could only put his hands to the test and embrace the hardship of idle work. But his work was never idle, always a challenge to his Achilles tendon that was located behind the foot, the shoulders, arms, forearms, and hands. For context, it might have been due to faulty technique, but Billy’s world was local rather than global. So bad habits within a vacuum came unnoticed. Anyway, the pickaxe was relentless in its pursuit, but he had to tame it, keeping his accuracy in position. But when he finally moved it forward, the accuracy then diverged, giving him an opportunity to draw that initial accuracy through the successive stages of the forward movement to hit his rocky target. His goal was all about learning to manage the physical vulnerabilities produced by constant work in order to reap the benefits thereof.\nHe shot forward, mining the store as fast as he could like a turned-on rabbit in a predatorless land. He slashed and destroyed the rock, segmenting its infrastructure like the Just toward the city. He removed it and broke it; he tied it down to the paddy field where rice was born. He humanized it and recognized it as it was, and that was how he birthed life to solid rock divorced. Then, continuing his immersion with mining rock, an interplay between colors and flashing lights erupted from the segments.\nBilly found his mind being transmitted to a magical plane.\nHe realized that he was here in the moment, but with a new feature in his mind—skills and spells. He was shown a holographic projection that listed out his new skills and spells.\nHe didn’t know what to do about it, but he was glad to have reached this level of enlightenment to see things that he had never seen. He had always been told by his parents never to question the unbelievable and to accept it as long as it wasn’t a demon or a demon pretending to be an angel.\nIt didn’t matter to him though, as he would soon ignore it to focus on his mining journey for the meantime.\nBilly already had magic, but it was only now that his general ability for magic was separated into distinct identities in the form of skills and spells. This was an evolution of his ability to think and form connections, especially in a magical level. Cognition played a significant role into how people entertained a heightened sense of existence characterized by the magical divulsion of the walls barring the self.\nA broader world beckoned him to grow and to see.\nBut he was not alone in this being beckoned. Notch, Shadrach, Nathan, Ethan, Sophia, Liam, Alexander, Oliver, Ava, Jackson, and Benjamin shared the same environment.\nBilly stared at the vastness of tight mining place, envisioning a broader world beyond these limitations. He knew valuable ores hid behind this restricting plane. He only had to see.\nHe met up with Notch and found himself shaking hands with many more people. One Notch represented a whole line of Notches influenced by him in the same manner that Notch was influenced by each and every one of them. He shook hands with a network when he shared drinks with one, word of mouth tearing through the excess gel-like clumps of blood blocking flow. He flourished by marrying hands with the sky of possibility produced by this composite.\nBilly was assigned a list of tasks by their trainer.\nThey were surprised to learn that the trainer’s adventurer friends were willing to help the apprentice miners out by boosting them with buffs. Even now, they were still being supported by all kinds of people for free. The apprentice miners had never seen such support from anyone else other than Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair, and they wondered if Nathaniel and the Just’s attack were the reasons for it.\nEventually, the adventurers brought various loot into the mines to show them the different kinds of loot. Since their route passed by this area, they thought that it wouldn’t hurt to get along with the kids their trainer friend managed.\n“So what’s this?” Notch said, being among the first apprentice miners to socialize with the adventurers.\n“Goblin ears, gnome hats, gnoll collars…” said one adventurer, Manbreaker. “There’s also ettin here if you’ve ever heard of them.” He found a piece of ettin fur and showed it to Notch.\nWhen Notch accepted it, he found that its texture was strangely oily. “Why does it feel wet?”\n“Oh, that’s just how it is. I guess you’ve never really been outside and about.”\n“How about you? I thought adventurers were only here inside the city.”\n“No, we do sometimes go far-far out. But yeah, I’d say most of us stay only here and check out the dungeons. That’s our forte, really.”\n“Okay.”\nIncidentally, Notch wondered how Goldberg was doing.\nGoldberg and the rest were shoehorned into roles they wouldn’t otherwise take if it wasn’t for the current circumstances of the city. In other words, their environment would always make the man.\nNotch was only here taking his time.\nThe adventurer couldn’t showing him various loot items, but ambition sparked in Notch’s heart, one lit every time a male grew to a certain age. It was the expectations of the city, the social hierarchy, and cultural history. He was to become a nameless laborer, whether in war or in the sleepless mines.\nHis life of abundance had a time limit.\nHe got up, and as time passed, he found that everything made sense.\nAnd he drifted away, eaten alive by the comforts of the city and the rules it had created for those who needed only to obey to be satisfied.\nBut those who had come to hate the sensibilities of their environment grow to become its opponents—while stuck in environments themselves, the goblins were antagonists to human prosperity. The late Just was a symbol of the Human eating itself in a similar sense to the snake that ate its own tail, Ouroboros. But this self-destruction was not total annihilation. It was the anvil on which humanity at its worst was forged. That was what goblins feared—a human pseudo-philosophical and pseudo-intellectual metamorphosis. For context, this level of transformation could be compared to the Age of Enlightenment. As for why they feared a metaphosis of this level, as societal tension escalated and rationales grew more sophisticated, goblins feared becoming the scapegoats of a new era, if not intentionally excluded from the scripts of ethics. In essence, they lay in apprehension about a potential realpolitik scenario.\nThis was politics.\nBut that was boring.\nGoldberg wanted to sleep. He was taking his time off for the first time in a while, not truly caring about this whole new position hero thing. He looked like a broken chalice, similar to the ones he saw thrown out on the road in front of the noble houses. It despaired to see such items thrown away. It didn’t really matter to him. All that mattered was the agency to act; any other past feelings belonging to his childhood he pushed away. It didn’t matter whether he was a dog, a car, or a man. What mattered was that he had a role to fulfill, and he would go all the way.\nChapter 35 - The Battle of the Monster Wave link Author’s Note\nI apologize for missing publishing a ## Chapter yesterday. Overall, I published 4 ## Chapters today, including the one extra ## Chapter I added due to missing publishing two days ago. However, when it comes to the ## Chapter I didn’t publish yesterday, I will double-post (publish a ## Chapter and an extra one) at a future date to compensate, maybe tomorrow. I appreciate your understanding.\nGoldberg stepped in front of a large door, hundreds of doors stretching far to the left and to the right.\nNext to him, two women reaching only as tall as his shoulders pointed at the door, encouraging him to enter.\nWhen he entered, he was not surprised, having been here before.\nThe room had a tall ceiling, leaving Goldberg to pause again and appreciate it with awe.\nThe people before him were high and mighty, as they were the congress.\nTransitioning to the city authorities’ purpose for him, the fact that he was here meant two things—they wanted him to play a larger role in the city, and they wanted him to leave behind his older life and completely become assimilated into the authority. This meant greater power in theory, but what really ended up happening was that people were going to do things. And he was going to do it. He didn’t really have power. All he had was a hand, and he did with it whatever people told him to do with it. It wasn’t agency. It was toolhood.\nHe sat down.\nContinuing the discussion of the city, instead of this congress place looking over the city, the city looked over it. This place was underground, as if he was hiding from what people could do. Magic played a great role in making sure that whatever happened in terms of decisions that impacted hundreds and thousands of lives were observed and responded to immediately, whether it be a celebration or an uprising. That was the waves and turns of the city. Time passed, and it just never stopped. It didn’t get so bad that it was unturn back to health, and it didn’t get so good that everyone just decided to abandon their magic and their weapons and their spells and their skills and their hopes and their dreams. They had a trigger, and the authorities were begging.\nThey begged for stability.\nThat was all they could they really do.\nAnd any hero that came about was really just, “Okay, this is what you do next.”\nShifting to a more objective perspective, he was wrong in implying that it was inevitable for the government to be weak forever. But he might be right that magic could serve as a means of limiting government power, though not inherently.\nBehind him, the two women continued down their business. Even with their personalities kept in check, they still returned home with the desire to eat their favorite foods and visit places that they enjoyed, even if it might have been peripheral to the main professional reason they were there in those places.\nTheir names was Luna Stardust and Zoey Sunshine, two friends who spent lots of time cultivating belief in the inevitability of two secretaries in the place of decision-making. The way they cast their ideals convinced the elements within government to shift their focus. It was primarily social ultimately, and any social manipulations added up to a broader sphere of influence. If one strung along a network throughout the government so large that ommitting would leave everything in collapse, then whatever faction was in control, they would survive the many bloodlettings that went on in the Royal House.\nIn contrast, they fished as a partime.\nAround the same time, Goldberg released himself from the cluthes of political hierarchy, running after a new quest to shield the barriers protecting the city in order to atone for his sins of leaving the apprentice miners and in order to get away from the more unsavory sides of being a symbol. But though he thought so, his actions were demarcated by the plans and strategies maintained by the government authority.\nMeanwhile, in the midst of this spontaneity and self-willed desperation amid systemic elements, hundreds of entities, whether human, monster, or magical force, were all tied to the greater goal of this world—to enact chaos.\nFurthering this idea, dancing outward to a broader, more natural part of this fantastical realm, the world was a chaotic place, and even now, monsters were being triggered by a global event, motivated into attacking the human races—perpetrators called the Succubi rang the bell of destruction that left the world in awe: an event had begun.\nEventually, hundreds of adventurers came at the gates, not shying away to protect the trees and harmony of the forest, guided by the guild and the authorities that kept their aim secure. In opposition, the monsters were headed here.\nSimilarly, Goldberg would be stationed at the gates sooner or later, but it wasn’t his designated time, which was a detail about government decision-making that he had overheard from the leaders he was regularly assigned to. To delve deper, this framework of being moved and turned according to the wishes of his greater social structure were cunningly manufactured. It was a matter of commanding him to entertain more than just his own manhood and beating human soul, but more crucially, the weight of the responsibilies left over in the aftermath of the Just. Extending this depth to his lifeblood, his children and his wife were still in suspension, left to fend as a separated identity while he was gone.\nSoon, he arrived.\nHis heart pounding in his chest, he made his way down the road, accompanied by legions of unique adventurers, each bearing a distinct style of fighting and personality. This was a family of warriors, so they had to show up and perform well today.\nGoldberg began running up the hill, targeting a large monster surrounding by fallen trees and legions of monsteers.\nHe commanded his archers to shoot at the enemy from afar while they kept their distance. But the monsters were fast, four-handedly sprinting their way forward, breaking apart the initial soft temporary magical defences the adventurers had employed to give a pause to the monsters’ charge. Meanwhile, Golderg said to retreat now that they had surmised the enemy’s strength. It was strange for him to be doing this, but his lack of strategy was crucial here. Even if it was a waste of time, his willingness to try out risky strategies, while inefficient, reflected is boldness in the midst of ignorance, which wasn’t necessarily a good thing, even in this desperate situation. But for the people present, it was the only thing they could do for now.\nGoldberg knew that the monsters could not be beaten by a head-on charge, and that was what kept him thinking. For someone who was just a regular adventurer who had only served as a guard, this role was practically impossible to deal with.\nHe needed to find a way to make sense of this.\nBut the battle was raging.\nHe called his team to cast magic at a line of enemies before he commanded them to put shields. What he was saying didn’t necessarily trigger their choices, but it mostly served as a way to unify their attacks. That was the only thing he was taught. The rest were given short training before he was dumped into combat. Since monsters were everywhere, they let Goldberg deal with the lesser monsters. But since Goldberg was that bad at strategizing, even these monsters were large threats.\nGoldberg commanded his team to shoot again and again, and it was working. But the monsters only had to charge forward, chase after them, and ambush them from blindspots in the flanks to begin destroying them one by one.\nGoldberg was immediately put to the rest.\nHe decided to go after the only thing he knew—to fight.\nHe tried fighting the monsters, but he found his leg pulled, his head gripped, and his body tossed.\nHe fell to the earth, and he was unable to get up anymore, for the monsters were all over him.\nGoldberg slashed his way out of there again, but that was his last chance.\nHe ran with the rest of his team, understanding that he needed the Marchacha goblins to help him. And if not them, he needed to train himself so hard that this never happened again. He lost 50 adventurers under him today.\nThe monsters continued onward; their legs felt as thick as they were tall. This onslaught would never end.\nThe adventurers kept ringing the bells of salvation, shooting their shots—wishing that every last one of them dropped.\nBut the monsters were growing in numbers.\nAfter everything, an external threat was the only thing that would remove all the complexities that lay inside the city. The humanity that made them them was overwhelming, and if not one person could do nothing, then all of this would fall apart.\nSomeone had to fight his way to the surface, and none of the previously mentioned individuals were fit for the job.\nIt needed someone with just the right military skill, but even that would yield sacrifices, as the tools, weapons, and resources were never perfect and fool-proof. People made mistakes from time to time.\nAnd that someone was the commander of the army, who was busy taking care of the monster vanguard.\nBut the issue was that he had hoped that Goldberg would solve the issue, as he was forced to utilize Goldberg instead of his more reliable men. The thing was that this monster wave was routine, but it was also very cruel and horrible.\nAnd that was what made this incredibly challenging.\nShifting to the conclusion, the fight continued for a few days, and soon enough, it ended.\nAll of those hopes, dreams, struggles, pain, and suffering were all dilluted once it all ended, as it was only a small wave in the grand scheme of things. It wsa too relatively tiny a fight that it left the whole world untouched and unapolegetic.\nFrom a broader perspective, it was just a game, and it was only one wave.\nTo explore this concept further, in children’s games, they had waves, and all the details that were supposed to be there in these games, if it was reality, were not there.\nIn this world, waves were the inevitable march of doom; games were the simple fight between monsters and humans; and people were going to die.\nMoving on to the moment, boys were playing in the field, unaware of the disasters practically right at their doorstep. Their laborer fathers spoke about it, and the boys understood to some degree, their eyes full of tense curiosity, as if about to face a great exciting tyrant like in a children’s game. This excitement stemmed from a joint interplay of curiosity and ignorance, leaving them creeping to explore the monster’s jaws.\nThey ran in the field; there, joy was in abundance. But sooner or later, that little tiny field they would soon see for what it was—nothing but a canvas for their wildest imaginations.\nThe world was even greater, and soon, they would seek power—the power to change this futile earth!\nBut many a child there who frolicked about would eventually transform into people playing a role in greater society.\nIn contrast, for the time, the children would try to break free from the sticky bubbly slime.\nThough, for now, they would play their game, and in it, vast worlds would become established. Upon this rock of thought, their souls would incline toward greatness. This was where the greatest minds became clear—in the art of childhood play.\nThey ran, screaming at the top of their lungs, their hands gripping weapons of play. They slashed each other, moving from side to side and flaying the air. The night approached, but they kept their stances, sweat dripping down their cheeks. Their heart pulsing, they jumped in flying motions and climbed slopes in order to advance and to retreat.\nThey obeyed the rules of this game they played, and eventually, the winners were often the most physically capable. But the children, in a similar manner to Goldberg, would soon hear of strategy, tactics, and tempo. And in small amounts, they did incorporate it, creating surprising moments for all of them.\nThey would need to discover that for themselves, and if not by themselves, then with the help of emulating others and their seniors.\nThey crept forward like soldiers in a war, hiding away and disappearing into the more superior night.\nMoving on to Goldberg, his mind’s reception to training was expectedly slow and confused, but he was determined to understand the ways in which fights were assembled and adjusted finely in very speedy increments with attention to every single detail bouncing against each other like tiny waves in a splash of water.\nEntering the moment, Goldberg said, “Now, what of it? I’ve seen several of them bumping about, but I haven’t actually been informed on the gruely details. Were they that presumptuous? I haven’t gotten a check yet by the Conglo, but it makes sense to diavow it right?”\nFor context, “Conglo” referred to the people in authority.\n“Are you defending them?” said a man next to him, Neverdie.\n“Yeah, what are you saying?” said another man, Lazan.\nGoldberg chirped, “Well, I haven’t been informed so. I was just assuming.”\n“Well, put your imagines away.”\nChapter 36 - Adventures and Reflections link Author’s Note\nTo start, this is an mid-arc author’s note, which means I’m intentionally shifting gears after the non-linear, multi-storyline, poly-character structure of the first arc. To rephrase, this new second arc will involve movements in narrative style to service better the evolving story. This means that in order to make the tale more linear and cohesive, the narrative style will shift toward tying characters together in an expositional, descriptive, thematic, and contextualizing manner, which is distinct from information dumps, without forcing events that would drag them together for artificial linearity and cohesion (1) and contrived immediate and continuous action, dialogue, and immediacy (2). This way, their progressively organically expanding storylines are secured while maintaining togetherness through more nuanced and delicate routes such as background and themes. Basically, when there are divers plotlines, there has to be some bond, and background context and themes shared by all the main characters, especially in relation to their respective directions, allows the story to maintain solidarity. In even shorter terms, the exposition are not information dumps, but tying rope or string elements, or binding agents. From a different angle, the story is wider in narrative scale and reach, so what is usually only short context becomes proportional in size to it, giving the appearance of an information dump. In contrast to what the earlier points might imply, the second arc is not necessarily better than the first arc. The first arc did employ the aforementioned strategies for the second arc, but the second arc is delving deeper into unity. In conclusion, this serves as a roadmap moving forward.\nSoon, Goldberg stared at the horizon and began his routine patrols. These patrols were also being included as part of his new “Hero’s Journey,” a new propangandized event to promote heroism among adventurers and to provide a sense of support and welcome to new adventurer entrants. This was an idea forged in collaboration with the New Adventurer’s Division. He was not only a symbol for adventurers, but in detail, he was a banner and a figurehead, showcasing the benefits of being part of adventurerhood, even amid the aftermath of the Just.\nFortunately, even after the losses, adventurers were still coming, because the new adventurer authorities worked alongside with the city authorities in orchestrating the message that the reason they lost was that the old adventurers had grown complacent—a method of distancing. That was why they grabbed the term “New Adventurers” from “New Adventurer’s Division” to reframe the new era, drawing copious support from entitled younger people. They sent a message to people all around, those were not that informed in magic, that they had imported new foreign artifacts and goods in order to bring life to adventurerhood and the country, showing that after everything they had lost, this was a new era of opportunity. What they were convincing was more than just the citizens, but they were drawing opportunity elsewhere from abroad. People were coming to invest in this open land that promised an even bigger version of itself to arise from the ashes.\nIn other words, with loss came a new era of investment. Many properties and long-established things were now gone, so it was an open slate for investment, given that the city institution itself still had a rich legacy of expertise on how to raise a city well, with only that weakness of being vulnerable to very rare catastrophic events like the Just. As long as people didn’t believe that an incident like the Just could happen again, then developers would only see a free space to make income-generating initiatives that could potentially appreciate significantly in value only the course of a decade; creating an ecosystem of community support. The clean slate was even better because awkwardness and wrongs in the details due to organic growth were gone, making way for an even more robust systematic methodology to create rectilinear patterns around the city.\nTurning focus to issues and their counterparts, resource scarcity could be met by investment; political tensions could be navigated due to people needing each other, resulting in new political ties from abroad that didn’t exist before; and social disparities could be addressed in this time of correction, even if the actual changes were minimal. However, given that Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair was a pillar of the immediate post-crisis, maybe addressing inequalities was possible to a satisfactory degree of improvement.\nReturning to Goldberg, he was just one instrument.\nThe monster attacks by the Succubi was also being portrayed as a sign of resilience on the city’s part, since the monsters only destroyed the barriers about which Priscilla, Goldberg’s wife, announced before. The adventurers who had lost their lives were not being pinned on Goldberg; in fact, the government provided eye-catching financial aid to their families, hoping that they kept their mouth shut in the face of their unaided neighbors who saw these open money-handover processions. If any did speak, younger people who had finally become empowered by this idea of newness with the New Adventurers that promoted young values, ideals, goals, and objectives since almost all the senior adventurers were now gone shamed them to oblivion. Indeed, the New Adventurers (NA) were associated with youth. If this was an electorate, they got all the young voters.\nTo conclude the use of the youth, the city heads used financial aid to victims’ families, youth empowerment campaigns, and vilification of dissenters to shape the public narrative. Furthermore, the youth were directed to attack old customs, old culture, old habits, and old ideas; the notion “Adventurerdom must live” even if the members of the NA had to die was hammered into them.\nThe city heads did this to preserve their authority.\nFurthermore, Goldberg was not being faulted for losing adventurers under his command, because he had neutralized the Just. As mentioned before, since he was an adventurer and not a prisoner or a goblin like the rest of the members of the team that had defeated the Just, he was selected and presented as the sole victor over the Just.\nAll this was happening simultaneously even if regular people like Billy, Notch, and Shadrach and their apprentice miner trainer only wanted to live comfortably.\nBut Shadrach was already in talks to become a part of the New Adventurers as a scribe or the like within administration, because the adventurer friends of the trainer, who hanged out with the apprentice miners, were members of the New Adventurers.\nReturning to the moment, delving into the other apprentice miners, they were Ethan, Sophia, Noah, Liam, Alexander, Oliver, Ava, Jackson, Benjamin, and Nathan.\nRelocating to Ethan’s perspective, he walked around, expressing himself in the most normal manner when he encountered a young gentleman in the middle of the forest. That gentleman was the bothered Nameless, who was supposed to have to have his peace and quiet in order to the focus on the coming goblin invasion. Though, Ethan was curious, and he was also tasked to go here because apparently, apprentice miners were included in a host of apprenticeships who were apparently also encouraged for use in menial tasks like talking to weirdos like Nameless to get him out of there and start training. They knew about Nameless, and they saw that he hid powerful strength. But the problem was that he was thinking in terms of the long term. He was planning and strategizing for a long term event—the goblin invasion. So that wasn’t going to happen any time soon. So the city state decided: “Why not now?”\nThe Nameless guy decided, “Let’s go!”\nAnd Ethan was like, “Okay, let’s go I guess!”\nNameless super-ran and flew somehow because he was so fast.\nEthan was so fast too and he knew he could fly metaphorically.\nThey ran like kids and dashed off to the horizon, where the city state was like: “Sure, bruh, we can have you, man. Just chillax for a sec., and we can have some fun.”\nWoohoo! They were, like, so fun and everyone was like, “Yeah baby!”\nIt was really nice to see them move around, I guess.\nTheir hearts were flying around in different directions, because it was just that fun.\nAt the city state, the government bros were like: “Hey man, we can accept, but like chillax I guess. We’ll be sending you to a strategic location. You know what that is? It’s a cool place for people to hang out and have drinks and, and fun! It’s for you guys, you know!”\nEthan gave the biggest bro fist he could ever give, and he and Nameless ran off super-fast.\nThey headed to the “location of interest” mentioned by the government men, and they were so excited.\nExplosions erupted, and they were wowed, jumping so high.\nThe people there came and approached them and said: “Yo, bro, we’re going to help you. But chillax for a second.” They kept saying “chillax for a second” like it was Cool Day Tuesday.\nEthan sat down, and the chair was so fancy. He felt like he was God or some king from far away lands. Foreign lands. And cool lands.\nHe actually didn’t understand what was actually happening, but he was excited.\nEthan saw a cool knight dude say, “I am Darkness Incarnate!” And he was so hyped. He wanted to train as well!\nMeanwhile, this knight was concerned with decorating his room, as he had lost several buildings in the Just attack. He was thinking that he could replace his acacia lounge chair, mahogany dining table, narra bookcase, mulawin wardrobe first before the rest. Currently, he was playing his role in helping out with cleaning out some of the monsters still abiding within the region and trying to establish locations of interest, or monster spawn hotspots, by controlling the dungeons and their dungeon cores.\nReturning to Ethan on a wider perspective, despite his devolution into loving cool stuff during exciting adventurer-adjacent events, he also enjoyed watching earth mages create clay toy blocks and create large structures for entertainment. This was also used to teach children how to use basic earth magic, especially in this pressing post-crisis period. The earth mages first set the scene, introduced the concept, gathered materials, performed the magic, allowed the children to explore and experiment with the clay, incorporated storytelling and role-playing into the clay with clay figures, buildings, land features, and items, encouraged the children to decorate and personalize the clay with leaves, rocks, flowers, and personal items and toys. Once the clay blocks, figures, and other objects dried in the sun or were fired with fire magic, the cihldren could then take them home. It was a beloved yearly event in a sensitive period of restoration. But weekly, they did this with very limited clay, enough to make a few figures per child. Overall, this played a significant role in Ethan’s upbringing.\nShifting gears to Sophia, she wanted to go outside, but it was “troublesome and tiresome,” a phrase her father often said.\nShe didn’t feel like going outside, and it was because her father forced her to stay up and carry rice bags inside the house.\nToday, she had to go to the mines, but she didn’t feel like it.\nShe was happy that she could sit down and walk around.\nShe was hoping to meet her friends, but they didn’t like her after what she said.\nShe was sad, but she also didn’t know.\nShe would contact the other apprentice miners, but she didn’t know.\nHer relatives were also coming, but she was too tired to greet them.\nHer mother wanted her to play with them, but she didn’t want to.\nMaybe, it was because she saw monsters.\nBut maybe her father was right.\nHe said that everyone comes to a point where things start to blur and people start seeming like monsters themselves.\nShe didn’t think monsters were bad.\nThey were just evil.\nHumans could be bad, and her cousins were always mean, telling her that she was ugly when she wasn’t looking.\nBut they were younger than her.\nAnd she had to be mature.\nShe looked at her father, who encouraged her to keep her focus up and become the queen-god, a name he half-jokingly referred to as.\nHer father was always right. He always listened. And he always gave her the chance to explain herself.\nShe would never give up!\nZooming out to a panoramic viewpoint, now that Ethan and Sophia were explored, Noah, Liam, Alexander, Oliver, Ava, Jackson, Benjamin, and Nathan remained.\nDiving into Noah, he was sitting down, gently pressing his arm against the sand. He didn’t really have anything left to do. He was trying to meditate using the sand.\nFor context, his family were Gnostics, but they were involved in a particular sect of Gnosticism that many other Gnostic groups would consider invalid.\nHe was educated in the teachings personally, so he knew how to read and write. He was often asked to recite statements from the sacred texts, and he would offer a more personal perspective to help less pious teenagers his age connect more with the Word.\nHe was more learned than Shadrach, but he focused his God-given gifts on his sect.\nZipping into one of his many encounters with God, when he heard the sound of heaven broke out, the spirit broke out. He broke our walls down. Pleroma came down.\nThe sound of children, youth, and men crying and shouting how they wanted to see His realm here. How they wanted Him to break their walls down.\nThe children were crying. They were looking for answers. Why did they feel so much joy? They later realized that He was really God.\nThe youth, crying, amazed. How did He forgive them? Why did He forgive them? They also realized that He was truly God.\nThe men and women, crying, still amazed after all these years. He couldn’t believe it! How could Someone love someone like them? Like him?\nHe didn’t feel like he belonged here, but if Someone like God tells him, “Look to me, as I am the author and finisher of your faith.”\nHe had no words, and he fell into His awesome presence.\nWell, he had backstabbed Him too much times to count.\nHe just kept on sinning even if he knew His grace was impossible, but this was different.\nNow, he just wanted to stay here in His presence forever. Now, he wanted to go out and share the sacred texts, and help others feel this true joy too. Now, he didn’t want to be alone. He wanted everyone he knew to see God’s goodness. He didn’t want others to feel the negativity of this world. God was so good that he could never have to feel ungrateful again. There might be times he fell, and there might be times he did mistakes. But, one day, he would be perfect according to God’s purpose for him, and that’s what he was longing for.\nBut he wasn’t just his beliefs. Yet he was nothing without God. It wasn’t about him. It was about Him.\nTransitioning to Liam, he was in a state of mild shock. He had just drowned a kitten after trying to quench its thirst. He stood up and looked around, finding that the world was that much more pragmatic. This would impact his life and remind him that kittens could die, but more than that, that he could kill.\nHe wasn’t his circumstances though. He got up and walked around himself, happily engaged in the moment. He knew that time could only last so long before it diminished and dissipated.\nHe climbed a hill and sighted his father cutting down banana trees.\nHe passed by him and kept going, noticing long-tailed macaques in the distance.\nHe ignored them and kept going. He used his magic to create various handles on a tree and climbed it.\nHe was the only apprentice miner who could climb this far up.\nHe was his capability.\nProgressing to Alexander, he ran from side to side, avoiding the attacks made by his friends.\nThey struck him on the chest, making him bleed.\nHe grabbed them before throwing them down.\nHe was big, so his purpose was told to lay in his strength.\nBut he loved flowers and the sun.\nHe never wanted to be a fighter for entertainment.\nAfter the fight was interrupted, adventurers rounded up the people present and had them go to jail. They also included Alexander in the count, bringing him to prison.\nIt was an illegal fighting ring.\nMoving away from Alexander to an omniscient view of the whole group, Ethan was with Nameless engaging in a specific task as a break from mining training; Sophia was in a transitional period, growing up and dealing with changes within her personality; Noah was a spiritual man; Liam was a very self-willed and active person compared to his other apprentice miners; and Alexander was naturally strong and had been part of illegal fighting rings.\nChapter 37 - The Fate of Charles Finch linkTo start from a broad angle, Oliver, Ava, Jackson, Benjamin, and Nathan remained unexplored.\nMoving on to Goldberg, he found himself at a loss. Groups of goblin slaves were coming back to him. He thought that they has escaped, but he saw that the adventurers sent out to catch them had returned with them.\nEarlier, when the adventurers neared the goblins, many of the goblins said to their leader, “Didn’t we say to you in Antipolo, ‘Leave us alone; let us serve the humans’? It would have been better for us to serve the humans than to die in the rainforest!” This was what caused the adventurers to catch them finally.\nReturning to the present, he walked around, eating ube halaya, a dessert made from ube, or purple yam. He was unable to be bothered to approach and give attention to the goblin slaves and the adventurers accompanying them.\nProceeding to another aspect, Goldberg was with the members of his patrol procession, including guards. As per usual , he wasn’t with any officials and representatives today, except for one minor representative who wanted to cultivate bonds with Goldberg himself. Though, Goldberg knew that the reason representatives and officials didn’t really focus on him was because it was an open secret that he was merely a puppet. But the minor representative took a risk and came with him on several occasions, using the opportunity to build rapport.\nHe was more comfortable, but he wasn’t out of the water yet. He still had many responsibilities to which he hadn’t become accustomed.\nSo he would drown in them for now.\nShifting to Oliver, he was arranging items in a stall, having been called to take the role of one of the staff. He didn’t really know how to farm produce, but he was there because he knew how to handle customers and guide them toward buying produce. So since he was socially efficient, he often was able to bring multiple conversations together and have people from different backgrounds find commonality and a sense of community. He brought people together, being the well-oiled machine that kept others drawn to his platform. The produce became an incidental underpinning of this platform, in a similar fashion to buying coffee at a cafe as a secondary goal and networking with various clients as a primary objective.\nSwitching to Ava, her eyes were peeled, as she aimed a bow, using her powerful muscles to draw it. She shot several targets simultaneously by creating several arrows magically in addition to the original one, breaking them with her magically-enhanced arrows.\nShe shot again, breaking apart a target shaped like a human.\nShe shot for the third time, destroying a goblin-resembling target.\nShe was being trained to fight, and this was just basic training for her. Her mentor trained her alongside 300 others; this was paid.\nTransferring over to Jackson, he began preparing items, as his parents were part of a large logistical infrastructure of city drainage repairs. These repairs coincided with drainage systems, which extended across underground dungeons rooms. These drainage systems were much more advanced, making it easier for people to live more hygienic lives. But it required much participation from a host of adventurers and specialized workers to maintain.\nAfter helping his parents leave finally, he headed to the mines, meeting Benjamin and Nathan on the way.\nAt this point, one month had passed since the day Maverick died.\nZooming into the mines, Billy was quickly dismantling an artifact that they located in a tunnel wtihin the cave system. Earlier, it was hard to grab it because he was afraid it was a trap, but with the help of Nathan, he was able to escape the eye-singers and take the artifact. They eventually showed it to their trainer, who immediately walked to get an artifact artificer, but Billy offered his hand-work to open it, emphasizing his strength in fingers. But it was because he finally found the equivalent of a reward for the harsh challenge of mining, so he didn’t want to waste the opportunity. When their trainer agreed, Billy began opening it, taking 5 minutes. When it opened, it let out an old metallic smell. It held an orb, something all artifacts held inside. So he took it out, but it was lifeless. Showing it to the trainer, Billy went outside to breathe. He was a little stressed, disappointed that the orb was dead. The trainer did warn him earlier to get his hopes up too much. But he was sad.\nNathan was sitting down, looking outside, his arms red with makeshift bandages. He was already getting stronger, because Billy had given him a spell after he showed him his holographic list of skills and spells.\nNathan’s new skill was [Mining Affinity], and that was why he was so powerful, every strike thunderously opening new loot boxes of opportunity. Each stone presented a challenge, and he vanquished it with ease, his form elegant and almost arrogant with how fast and quick he disassembled it. He ran around, slashing stones, pushing forward and creating tunnels. He was not unhappy with this situation, a smile shivering on his face. He needed it more and more. But now he was at rest.\nShadrach was not there, but he was there with them in spirit and through the notes he had given them, detailing advice upon advice of past events and lessons learned. It was more a philosophical expression of ideas in simple words, but it did hide injections of beautifully written explanations that helped them stay committed in spite of the lengthy pauses they had to endure periodically whenever a pocket of monsters were discovered. Hired adventurers would come in and take hours to kill them before the miners were allowed to progress to the next chamber. It was a slow process, and mining couldn’t be done in a continuously absentminded manner. It had to be done with strategy and patience, interspaced by long breaks.\nBilly, Nathan, Shadrach, and the rest of the apprentice miners who had witnessed the death of their fellow 48 apprentices were in a state of pause, and only time could tell when the gravity of those effects would manifest in full. But it was already there inside them. Some became much more pragmatic; some held on to their childhood even more, paradoxically resulting in them maturing even faster; and others were successful in maintaining their sense of self while hiding the version of themselves that had seen that traumatic incident.\nMoving on to Charles Finch, he hit several goblins, sweeping them off their feet and pushing them further out. They couldn’t catch him with his new powers and stronger, athletic young body. He cast lightning, felling them and slashing them down with bouncy impacts. He swirled, moving sideways and catching their attention and forcing them tight together before unleashing his lightning to consume their lifeforce via magically destroying their body. At the end, he stood alongside James Boulevard, who was huffing and catching his breath with a smirk.\nJames and Charles climbed up the steps to a large hill, where they oversaw a large region. They didn’t know it, but they saw the tree that Liam climbed earlier. And it was below them.\nThey looked up again, seeing the mountains surrounding them in a distance, while they lay isolated, but with each other. They were also with the rest of John Roger’s proxy adventurers. So they continued down to locate the goblin necromancer who killed many of John Roger’s men before.\nThey climbed back down, returning to the world. Today, they would eat the dirt and crawl. That way, they would kill their enemy.\nThis was their destiny—to be humble to be calm.\nThey began clothing, arming, armoring, and encouraging each other and themselves, forging a path onward.\nLater, one among the goblins targeted by them squealed, as his torso was shot through with a harpoon. One of the proxy adventurers was a master of harpoon-fighting.\nThe harpoon drew the goblin’s fragile body to the adventurers, as their feet met the body and blood. They would not stop here. No.\nThey would press onward.\nThe goblins armed themselves, but they did not comfort each other because their existence was death.\nThey ran up and jumped, charging without pause.\nIt was their life, and it was their first and final death.\nThe goblins were massacred, and the adventurers sustained some vertigo here and there due to the mental magic employed by one goblin mage.\nThe goblins fell to the earth, as they were rounded up and cast into cages where their existence was now behind bars.\nThe adventurers left, their backs facing the goblins’ rageful expressions.\nBut these expressions were temporary, soon replaced by dullness and nihilistic loss.\nMeanwhile, the adventurers’ faces smiled at each other, their clothes dancing in the wind, their armor cold and tyrannical in its systematic protection of brutal men, their weapons the divine master that ruled their lives, unable to be defied and controlled. They contorted their expressions according to their wishes alone.\nThe goblin necromancer stood before them, his form blurry, his eyes sharp. He shot down an adventurer—two, three, four, five. By the time he shot down eight adventurers in total, the adventurers grabbed him and neutralized him swiftly.\nThe lives of their lives of their lives were made null and void.\nCharles fell to the earth, his life escaping him. He had lived a long life, and nothing ever made sense. But today, he chose to conclude his own life on his own terms. He had a long journey, sure, but that journey was now over. This world chose him, and he chose his destiny today to die.\nThat death was sudden, but his life was never sudden, always surprising surely but never so coherent that he would dare declare defiance against this consistency of suddenness.\nHe fell away, his whole life flashing before his eyes.\nAnd he wasn’t saved, being only one of John Roger’s many attempts at experimentation and uplifting nobodies into his hierarchy to see what they would do.\nCharles choked in his last breath, as the blood pooled in his mouth. His eyes were reddened, and the adventurers surrounding him spoke in hushes voices about something else entirely. He would soon fade into the abyss. He wasn’t able to reach out and catch it.\nHe would do it. He would do everything. He would save the world.\nAnd cadence. He died.\nThe mockery of this earth subsumed him to form a new creature in the form of life—a baby with the mind of a young man from Earth was birthed.\nThis was the only thing to pass by, transitioning from one life to the next. This was coherence at its most suspected.\nWhether this was reality or not was up to choice.\nBut soon enough, the ringing bells would come screaming in the ears. The pain would be too much to bear. And a breakdown could occur.\nThis was reality at its closest.\nCharles Finch screamed in hell, bursting on the floors; wishing that he could escape. But there he lay, unable to save the children he had wished to save.\nHe raged upon the floor and devils poked him, tying him up and dragging him.\nHe finally ended it—his journey.\nWas he ever there?\nCharles sat down, poked by torturous nails and stabbing objects.\nHe took it and screamed as he thought about the blue sky.\nHe hated his death, but that was because it was too painful now.\nBut he lowered himself and began to crawl, his arms pressing against sharp features of the floor. He pressed forward, his limbs shaking with excruciation. His skin was being grabbed and pulled back intensely, ripping seams and causing him to bleed through large pores in his body. He proceeded, his heart clinging to the idea of change, as he screamed timely again and again. He fell apart. But within his body, he leapt out in the form of a ghost, lingering long enough to form another body. He kept walking, but this time, he was not hit by the sharp objects and nails. He was translucent and unable to be touched. He kept walking on the floor however, allowing him to reach his destination—a makeshift seat of rock.\nHe sat down and began to cry, pondering about his forced existence.\nHe never wanted to go to hell.\nBut he did.\nHe accepted it and stopped crying. Today, he would understand what it meant to live inside a dungeon jail cell.\nThis was not hell.\nIt was a temporary place for him.\nHe would soon go into an even worse floor. That would be true hell.\nHe disappeared into the torture.\nThe Just brought him back into consciousness, shaking him. “How are you, Sir?” he said, his polite tone surprising Charles.\nCharles had seen many tortured souls here, but he had never seen one as composed and polite as this man.\nThe Just tried to remove the pores in his clothes by rubbing them, wishing that they would suddenly supernaturally disappear. But he accepted reality and knew that he would have to deal with it for now.\nHe was more interested in catching someone conscious enough to deal in conversations. If he could spend his time here in a less idle way, then his might would not be eroded overtime. This might had relied on focused hope. He needed not remove hope.\nCharles smiled almost, but he was afraid because he knew the Just.\nThe Just took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and then opened them.\nTheir eyes were fixated at each other, and their journey would continue onward from here.\nDistancing from them and heading into a wider scope, hundreds of monsters and humans inhabited the dungeon floor, hellish fires and devils stabbing at them and bleeding them out until they regenerated. This process repeated and repeated, no one there to stop them.\nChapter 38 - Convergence and Collaboration: Uniting Forces in a Shifting Landscape linkEntering into Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair’s current life, he was sitting in a very large room full of various representatives of various parts of the city. Each representative made sure that his reach was secure. He was also one represenative, as he was not head of state. That would be the King, who sat down, wearing purple and yellow layers of clothes.\nHe didn’t want to bore himself too much, so he kept his focus acute by rubbing his arms again and again, having picked this habit up from seeing Millie and Shadrach do it multiple times in the past.\nAfter this cabinet-like meeting, Nathaniel left. He was only introduced after having only been at the sides secretly influencing the decision-making behind the scenes for a week.\nShifting to another aforementioned unnamed perspective, a young girl began using her fire to smelt ores and help traveling blacksmiths out as a camp follower. Officially, she was a camp follower, but effectively, she served a minor role within the division of blacksmiths. This became the case after her doctor father and geomancer mother were introduced as a part of this new military force.\nThis military force had a very different role compared to the adventurers, as their particular battalion was part of a larger amphibious assault against monster invasions within an archipelagic sea, which attacked in a similar way to barbarian migrations. However, this was done with the understanding that success was temporary and the vacuum left be defeated monster tribes or groups would be filled by new ones. Indeed, they would have to draw back immediately and focus on cohesion and consolidation, not allowing the city-state to spread out too much that the monsters could defeat them by isolated and remote detail. This was why the barriers announced by Priscilla signified an isolated and small but important step forward. In conclusion, the human army recognized the need to counter the monsters’ tactics, regardless of their level of organization.\nReturning to the young girl, she walked around, carrying a heavy bucket with both her arms. Her doctor focused on physical improvements for her to mitigate effects of a lack of exercise, even as she improved as a fire mage. Her mother agreed with him, being the one to inform her husband that she had struggled physically due to being trained excessively in geomancy, which resulted in her being not as well-rounded. It was the doctor who allowed her to become more balanced, yet it was also her specialization that connected their family to the military, marking an opportunity for the both of them to excel in different ways. The young girl was the product of the familial perspective pooled by both.\nAs she continued to unleash her talent, the army progressed gradually, switching directions several times in only a few hours.\nDelving into the tactical maneuvering aspect of this scene, when an organized monster group they had eyes on began marching antagonistically, the adventurers used the rainforest and the hills to navigate and find a better position in which to fight. The monsters backed off before they tired out, resting. This happened over 10 times. No one could chase out the other. Monsters might be fast, but humans could march for longer. Both sides had long-range magic abilities, which they used. But magic shields nullified artillery, making air superiority very complex. Moreover, usually, small unit tactics was more feasible in this tropical rainforest mountainous environment. However, larger singular groups were still possible, since magic could keep the team cohesive and tight while still dynamic internally. Magic like mobility spells, communication magic, terrain manipulation, warding magic, and logistical support allowed more flexibility in a large group. As for the insistence on oneness, magic were more precise and concentrated in droves than in detail, as the enemies could tighten up and use magic shields, effectively rendering any poking attacks negligible. They also used internal lines to reduce and compartmentalize mortar-like effects. Similarly, they separated and compartmentalized internally in a rectilinearly bouncing manner to discourage attacks that rested upon a tight internal enemy formation for efficacy. On a more nuanced level, when stationary objectives and vulnerabilities were relevant, that complicated dynamics. However, the armies’ concern actually was to ward the area and accustom themselves to the area. So it was more so a battle of accumulating control and keeping an eye out for opportunities to attack, progressing toward controlling strategic locations and objectives. It basically meant accumulating advantage overtime until the enemy force was forced to fight head-on at pivotal points. It basically meant increasingly accumulating advantage until the enemy force was forced to fight head-on at pivotal points. In other words, they maneuvered, probed, established a presence, and poked and wore down the enemy; setting up favorable conditions to force more direct confrontations on their high ground, which required finesse in tempo, big picture thinking, and smaller-scale combat mechanical skill. Unfortunately, this level of human commandership had been unavailable during the Just’s attack. In conclusion, the young girl played a small but special role in something bigger than herself, and that gave her a sense of purpose, place, and pride in opposition to a chaotic, nihilistic world, her parents striving alongside her.\nMoving on to a separate section, throughout the constant movement and direction switching, the young girl, whose name was Isabella de la Cruz, and the rest of the camp followers had to be quick.\nShifting to the monsters, they included various goblin tribes: Marchacha goblins, Jacobean goblins, Ralson goblins, and Colobus goblins, among others.\nThe Marchacha goblins, being rather unorganized and full of various individuals rather than a top-down organizational structure, stood around a giant boulder.\nThe Jacobean goblins, full of golden accesssories and poly-colored clothes, sat down on the ground with their legs crossed and heads bowed, walking the fine line between maximalism and humility.\nThe Ralson goblins stood behind several magically modified catapults, using them as a sign that they were superior to humans, even though they had stolen that originally from humans themselves.\nThe Colobus goblins were incredibly large, wearing simple clothes, but they were the one with the most artifacts, being collectors who hunted down artifacts from dungeons underground the most. They controlled the region, being the father who brought all of these goblins here.\nBut these goblins made up only one aspect of the monsters.\nReturning focus to Billy and the rest of the apprentice miners inside the city, he heard a horn sound that was heard throughout the region; the Succibi monster waves had finally ended with the last wave monsters being killed.\nThis marked a new stage, not just for people but for mining, as more resoucres would be channeled into it.\nSpeaking of which, examining the miners of the city, not the apprentice miners, they continued their journey underground, entering a new large floor connected to various huge tunnels and chambers, with one chamber containing a large pool of water where divers monsters hung to the walls and lounged around on the floor.\nEventually, a young adventurer, Divrese, was busy helping an innkeeper enter into an artificially created tunnel on this new floor. They were here because they wanted to get a specific artifact in a dungeon. They were told that it would be here, and it was.\nBut even if it was glowing on a pedestal, it was in a chamber partitioned into different levels, holes, and parts, with spikes.\nIn the meantime, Billy and the other apprentice miners were above the new floor, cooling themselves with fresh water. This was their big world surrounding them, so Billy had been right about there being opportunity beyond the walls with the inclusion of the new floor.\nBilly began striking rocks, moving them to containers and then to wagons. There, they grabbed several footstools that would be used for the trainer, the adventurers, and some of the resting apprentice miners—which were originally used by Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair—and sat down on the wagon next to them holding onto them to keep them balanced. It was heavy, but on the journey home, they were excited to get some rest finally.\nNathaniel’s familiar adjutants stopped their wagon.\nBilly was surprised to see them, getting out first before Nathan, Sophia, Oliver, Noah, Liam, Jackson, and Benjamin. As mentioned before, Ethan, Ava, Shadrach, and Alexander were absent, but Noah, Oliver, Sophia, and Liam were able to catch up last second to the mines earlier in the day.\nThey were being made to visit Goldberg, who finally began to see Nathaniel more and more since Nathaniel’s official emergence. Nathaniel was the one who initiated with Goldberg and many others, hoping to promote support for mining entrants with the introduction of the new floor. This floor was also a hotspot for adventurers, so Goldberg immediately agreed to collaborate. Nathaniel had finally gotten in touch with Goldberg’s former companions, the prisoners and the Marchacha goblins. He was pushing against the adventurer-monopolized narrative, and the former companions, who were part of the team who had killed the Just, would aid in that effort.\nChanging to Goldberg, he stood in a large courtyard, accompanied by a host of adventurers, industry leaders, and officials. It was a very safe place.\nNearby, Catherine, Samuel, Joseph, Benjamin, and William, the former prisoners, and the representative of the Marchacha goblins, Kahul, were finally included in an official capacity.\nAnd Nathaniel was instrumental in that, spreading the message of their essential part in defeating the Just to the everyday people, with whom he had established a pivotal relationship as a savior and pillar; showing an alternative route for those disturbed by the sudden shift brought about with the New Adventurers. This forced the city authorities to help Nathaniel, as the everyday people were already convinced and excited.\nSo it resulted in this event, which had been set up hastily due to the abruptness of the reactions to the suddenness of the New Adventurers and Nathaniel’s timely broadcast of his message.\nThat was why it was held in a courtyard. Though, the city authorities would have preferred to prepare it at a purpose-built venue, but they also wanted to contain it and keep it tucked away from the public eye since they had limited time and space. If they did have a purpose-built venue prepared months prior for it, they would have chosen that, but this was the best they could do it for an official gathering.\nZooming in to the apprentice miners, they were busy pushing and arranging the items on the wagon to ensure that it didn’t fall off. But they were also pushing the wagon and the items’ limits by leaving them out in the sun. This event didn’t have a place for everyday laborers with wagons, reserving them for the officials.\nIncidentally, since today was a big event, a familiar task master, Sprutnoa, stared in the crowd, having supported Nathaniel as well. Even if he wanted to work and work, the aftermath of the Just shifted his priorities and made him more flexible, helping out his fellow laborers in recovering. He might have been a strict person who cared for hierarchy, but the hierarchy had changed. And he was personally glad to see the arrogant adventurers getting cucked (with a cucking stool).\nReturning to the apprentices, they entered, reuniting with Nathaniel.\nNathaniel smiled, his wife and children present inside with the rest of the delegation families. Some of the officials themselves had lost lots of buildings in the Just’s attack, so they made use of official buildings as a place for their families to stay. This was what Catherine, Nathaniel’s wife, made a point when she came with her children.\nMoving on to a new friend-enemy of Nathaniel, naturally, John Roger was here, and he was the one of the reasons for the rise of the New Adventurers. But he also didn’t extend all of his effort toward it, as the New Adventurers espoused consolidation of all adventurers, which included independents and proxy adventurers such as those belonging to John.\nSpeaking of which, his proxy adventurers were here, including Elizabeth, Mary, Sarah, and James Boulevard, excluding the late Charles Finch.\nThey all looked forward, sweat dripping down the sides of their face, the sun beating down on their face, their hearts throbbing tensely.\nThe event would soon commence.\nChapter 39 - Under the Sky of Reflection: Finding Closure in the Embrace of Silence link Author’s Note\nI apologize for the 7-min delay. Also, this is a particularly short ## Chapter; though, even with this, my word average is still about 2600 when it should be 2500. In the end, I think allowing the story itself to experience moments of rest in this manner is still within the story’s vision. I appreciate your understanding.\nCharles, the Just, and now Maverick, the person who had started it all, sat down around a campfire in a hellish landscape. They were accompanied by two others, two bandits. In the distance, hundreds of humans, goblins, and all sorts of different humanoids and monsters roamed around, many discussing in groups. It was break time, and hell was currently frozen over to signify that.\nIn this world, hell continued for seven days and seven nights before resting on the eighth day. Then it repeated.\nTheir conversations were loud, but they were too far away.\nBack in the normal world, at the event, several guards walked inside, accompanying an imprisoned humanoid.\nA man displayed this shackled humanoid, saying, “This is a calfear, a creature from the far north. He is here because we have located him deep in the northern dungeons where the walls are paper thing and the structure shifts without rest. He represents a path forward to explore new horizons for our far-north adventurers.”\nA woman, who wasn’t supposed to be talking, said: “The city only had so many resources to spend, and we’re spending on these New Adventurers, who want to explore some hellish landscape that only began circulating due to Nathaniel’s companions?”\n“Nathaniel’s companions” here referred to the former prisoners and the Marchacha goblins, but they didn’t know that their identities, only that the information came from them. It was an accidental leak to the New Adventurers, and there’s been a new rise in focus toward the exploration division of the adventurer guild. What used to be only dreams and scraps were now being considered heavily as part of the new agenda.\nThe rest of the people kept the silence and ignored the woman, moving forward with the event. The heated aspects were memorable for those relevant and in close proximity, but they were actually only very incidental and mostly ignored by most of the attendants. It was the usual beat of more formal events.\nThis made it difficult to create changes in the current government, but it also kept things stable.\nNathaniel was being made into a prop piece, and that was why he was present. He was more a threat when he was hidden and tucked away as an underdog and not given a chance to speak officially while still maintaining a strong influence among the people. If he was given a chance to speak, there was potential in his own self-erosion. The more he spoke, the more he was likely to make mistakes. They wanted to reveal him for the person he truly was and break the mystery and symbolism surrounding him. This way, they could toss him away like a dirty rag. Indeed, he was a hero, but his current agenda was piercing into what was supposed to be a more stable, growing conflict between multiple sides.\nBut the leaders, many of which were united despite their conflicting interests, had to be very cautious if this was their intention.\nNathaniel also wasn’t the sole issue. They had to keep track of John Roger, who was part of a growing aspect of the landscape. His views with regard to keeping private adventurers hid a very troublesome contradiction to their future plans.\nIt was a many-side thing.\nShifting to Billy, he smiled, laughing at Notch when he dropped his apple in a humorous way.\nNotch looked around. “It’s a pretty place, no?” he said.\n“Yeah, adventuring is so fun like molten lava! And I can only the magicking that, you know, people said there was supposed to be.”\n“Right,” Notch said before shifting to a tone of confidence. “I have the best plan.”\nBilly and Shadrach looked at him. They had been merely deputies of Maverick only a month ago, but today, Notch was doing it again—that same tone of voice that they hadn’t heard in a while combined with their current tense environment reminded them of day 1.\nNotch sauntered forward, his face bare for people to see.\nBilly and Shadrach didn’t follow him this time.\nNotch approached Nathaniel, who was currently unattended by anyone.\nMeanwhile, Sprutnoa was outside in the streets among large crowds of people, holding onto the magical artifact Maverick had hit him with.\nReturning to Notch and Nathaniel, they sat down, watching the nobles. “How are you?” Nathaniel said.\n“I was…” Notch said, trailing off when he saw the calfear humanoid from earlier passing by. He continued, “I was with everyone… We’re doing fine. We’re all here. Your people brought us here.”\n“Yeah, I could bring people with me, and they said they were hoping for me to bring many friends and companions. So I did.”\n“Okay.”\n“Yeah…”\n“Do you still remember when Millie was here?”\nNathaniel paused. “Sorry? Millie, who’s that?”\nNotch subtly opened his mouth in shock before composing himself. “I… She was the guard with us before… when we were still…”\n“Oh, my bad. I know her, I know her. It was before that, right.”\n“Yeah. Before that.”\nAfter a long pause, Nathaniel’s face shifted from a genuine smile, to growing tension, to sadness, to grief, to realization, and acceptance. “Yeah.”\nNotch didn’t know why this person felt so different from what he looked like, but he saw someone else when they first met.\nSoon after this event started, elsewhere, a wave of goblins entered into an outpost, searching it and bringing the unarmed humans inside to the main floor before killing them with polearms.\nSpeaking of a wave of goblins, Nameless, who believed that one would come, was worried when he heard about the movements of goblins throughout the region, standing next to Ethan, as they continued to dig trenches, as they prepared for rainwater runoff. Their unit intended to set up camp in this tropical rainforest mountainous area, using magic to do the equivalent of slashing and burning.\nThey protected only a small portion, but each point of interest and an accompanying control strategy made dynamics throughout the common region much more feasible to manage and maintain the ins-and-outs and ebbs and flows within.\nDuring this time, the city maintained its formal focus in the event, each decision marking completely different futures with a whole set of challenges and frontiers of concern.\nTransitioning to the event, John Roger stood, his form like a gladiator. He wore clothes befitting an adventurer, but he wore it like a noble, becoming a gladiator in the eyes of many. His eye-catching nature made it difficult for him to avoid scrutiny, but it also made his presence specially more felt, especially when concerns were splayed and centered at different individuals such as Nathaniel. He proactively considered how well magical behavior came into play with magical concepts such as essentialism and ecologism, but also in facets of bureacracy.\nHe stood by, being passed by by Billy and Nathaniel.\nHe knew well that he was only one part of the puzzle, extending his focus to Nathaniel’s companions, including the prisoners and the Marchacha goblins. These goblins were portrayed as humans, wearing cloaks that hid their green skin and masked their shorter height. The prisoners blended easily, looking like a warden’s family with Catherine as a brought-in child. They looked too assimilar to be her actual parents; though, they were also all biologically male.\nJohn Roger crossed them out from his focus, zeroing in on Priscilla, whose husband was Goldberg and Catherine Orlov Sinclair, whose husband was Nathaniel. They were talking to Goldberg and the representative following him around, exchanging minor information that were prioritized by groups overhearing them behind them on both sides.\nHe didn’t notice Billy’s apprentice miner companions.\nHe returned to his proxy adventurers and reminded them to relax absentmindedly.\nAs the event cruised by, discussions were held at surface-level, while implications were being shared impactfully. Context determined the difference between a delegation family member and a delegate, so it wasn’t hard to share key information. However, from time to time, it leaked out through espionage, given that officials had to contextualize for friends and peers outside office to understand, whether it was part of a joke, a bragging story, or just plain boredom (carelessness).\nThe night grew lonelier, as the city became more interconnected in spirit, just for this virtual and symbolic moment.\nThe event ended, sparking a new stage in the city’s journey.\nPeople walked home, and nothing bad needed to happen.\nIt all could be forgotten, and individuals could focus on their own goals.\nEven Sprutnoa, who was holding onto a magical artifact, didn’t really bother doing anything or thinking seriously about it beyond a week.\nAfterwards, Billy returned to normalcy.\nHe went outside, watered the plants, and remembered what it felt like to be human.\nThe noise of the public amid the great events happening all around bothered him, so he came here where not a single soul lived except him.\nThis activity of exploration wasn’t as fulfilling or enjoyable as mining and working hard, but it was relaxing, reflective, and unwinding.\nHe lay down on the grass.\nThe sky was wide, stretching in two vast directions.\nNameless stood up and climbed a tree before going back down. He didn’t need to climb the tree fully. He could leave things unfinished. He didn’t need to find closure when it was more feasible to let go when closure was nowhere to be found or when striving for an extreme path to closure only ruined him.\nHe lay down.\nNathan stared at the sky.\nHe lay down.\nOliver lay down. The rest of the apprentice miners lay down.\nEveryone lay down.\nThey and rest became friends.\nChapter 40 - Echoes of Progress and Shadow linkNotch arranged several different containers, doing this as a way to distract himself, having been put through too much in the first day of his mining training since the event.\nHe didn’t really want to care too much, which was why he only gave Nathaniel perfunctory responses at the event.\nHowever, it was nice to have seen him again. He couldn’t deny that.\nHe was also still very young, making it hard for him not to ask questions, so he did ask lots of questions at the event, keeping Nathaniel, the former prisoners, and the Marchacha goblins within asking distance.\nAfter putting the containers together finally, he was asked to look for a specific item and hand it to the trainer.\nThis was getting hard to keep up, but Billy was positive about things.\nNotch did have it easy, and he was improving a lot. But the last few weeks had been tough on him, putting him through so much in a short amount of time. He honestly wondered how Shadrach, the youngest of the trio (Notch, Shadrach, and Billy), was so confident and involved.\nBut things were going smoothly. It had only been one month, and much had changed. But this was good for him.\nHe mined quickly, smashing several rocks before grabbing the remains.\nHe didn’t really hate it, and BIlly’s new skills and spells were helpful as well. But he and the rest of the apprentice miners all had inherent magic since Goldberg and Milly’s attempt at stimulating them safely. People could die if exposed to too much mana in a dangerously concentrated amount of time.\nThings were going smoothly. He just had to bear it, but the memories and faces of the 48 apprentice miners who had died wore him down, leaving him naked with fear at times. But Nathaniel had been the binding force that led them together through difficult times, even guiding them to the darkest areas of the cave. But now, they were much more confident, even approaching eye-singers to baiting them into adventurers’ arms. Indeed, they were being tasked with acting as bait for the adventurers in order to “test and train” them according to them.\nBut it was good since the adventurers did teach them about various loots from time to time, so anything they did added up to a social form of scrip. Even if it ended up becoming fruitless in the end, they would have found it worth doing, since they were curious and daring as well, being outgoing boyish teenagers.\nMeanwhile, a group of monsters, constituting a chest mimic and two demons, continued down the slope that led to a village, finding their purchase when they struck the trapdoor that led to a tunnel leading inside the village itself. They smiled with joy. This village was a small straw that created controlled space between two junctions that led to a broader inner range controlled by the city, one concerning Ethan and Nameless. It was a minor part, but its eventual destruction could lead to dangerous set-ups here and there in the monsters’ favor.\nHowever, even if the group were composed of monsters, monsters were not a monolith. They shared different factions and sides, and they often acted independently. It just seemed monolithic in the view of the humans.\nHowever, any contribution toward human destruction benefitted all human-targeting monstrosities.\nA singular individual orchestrating the destruction of the city was present.\nSpeaking of which, elswhere, Silavush, an older fish man, was walking down a flight of stairs, having sighted his friends, who wore purple and yellow outfits. Giant 13-meter-tall humanoids frog-humanoids, wearing ornate clothes and various golden accessories donning their wrists, neck, and fingers, stood at a 100-meter-tall door.\nHe smiled, grabbing their enormous, flabby hands and shaking them, saying that he would have loved to meet them at a better time, lightly hinting that he didn’t like that they came days earlier than scheduled.\nThe frogs were smirking, as one of them handed Silavush a scholl with red stamps and beautifully written geometric text. “We want you…” she said with a deep, gurgly, cavernous voice. “…to check this before we hand you the property.”\nSilavush nodded politely as he offered a seat, bothered by their insistence on presenting the scroll without a polite rest, dinner, and then meeting in an approrpriate room. He wanted formalities to be respected, since he was raised by a strict landed noble father.\nWhile they talked, earlier, one of the frogs sat down at one of the chairs intended for the human guards, breaking the chair.\nSilavush pretended not to notice.\nReturning to the present, Silavush led the frogs to a resting room, where they would be given massages and other forms of relaxation with magic as an aid. Though, the frogs naturally had magic shields passively protecting their bodies, but it did allow massages and other non-harmful forms of touch. It was smart and proactive, reflecting their wealth.\nSilavush didn’t want to bother giving them a dinner after he saw them standing up in the room and looking out the window instead of lying down and relaxing. “Excuse me, are you ladies and gentlemen in preference to specialized equipment?” he asked politely. It was not Millie-level formalness, but it would do.\nAfter the frogs finished their relaxation and ate dinner, they then came to the meeting chamber where they were given reports by orators about the new events of this particular region. The frogs were here to learn and to share their interests in the region.\nBut Silavush didn’t care; however, he didn’t want to refuse them, being one with a reputation for being inclusive toward any sort of noble from any region.\nHe was not the one accepting the requests to send monsters, so he sent them a tiny portion. But this tiny portion was enormous in the eyes of Antipolo city.\nHe was so powerful, but he was more concerned with keeping things simple, because his main goals related to the portal room that led to different realms. He didn’t care about this realm as much, having ascended to the top already.\nAnyway, shifting away from Silavush, Billy located a dungeon finished off by Divrese and his innkeeper companion. Many monsters that were supposed to be here were absent. They had been turned into dust.\nBilly, being only a dot in comparison to the whole dungeon floor, went back to the human-sized tunnel that he carved into the subterranean landscape. He disappeared back into one of seventy chambers connected by tiny tunnels, making his way back to the chamber closest to the surface. This would take a long time, but it had been some time since they started. Their progress was vast and wide-encompassing. However, it could be easily turned back to solid rock quickly, because it relied on magic to sustain the weight. And it was a lot of weight. So the support pillars were very thick, but they were able to get it there in the first place due to magic.\nIt looked very scary underground, as the magic used led to orange coloration of the nearby rock, looking like a foreign realm. Even the texture of the rocks and the feel of the chambers felt surreal, dreamy, and disorienting.\nWhen he returned to the chamber next to the surface, he saw Ethan and Nameless talking to the adventurers and his trainer with friendly, casual demeanors. One of the adventurers even placed his hand on Nameless’ shoulder. He didn’t really mind it, but it made him curious. He wondered if things were going to change from now on.\nIn the meantime, Goldberg, after heading down various valleys and paths through the forest, came to a mountain finally, having scaled it only once in the far past.\nHe was already moving to a different stage of his life, one involving exploration as per the New Adventurers’ request. It was less of a request, but more so pressuring from their side of the government. It didn’t really matter though, since Goldberg hated patrolling around the city anyway. It wasn’t for him, and the constant writing at the office made him dizzy. He hated being treated like a bureacrat even if he didn’t speak at all. He was just someone being made to look like he was working hard. But he was working hard, so it worked.\nNow that he was here at the mountain, it provided respite, allowing him to breathe the fresh air.\nEvery moment was magical, and new shifts in the world were finally happening, giving him room to breathe.\nThe event was more than just an event, but it was the first big event since the Just attack that had upturned everything.\nHe put his hands against a couple leaves. This was the first time he had touched leaves this far outside in years. Today, he was with his kids, but they were not really working or anything. The city leaders had allowed him to bring them, and that worried him for a while. But Priscilla said it would be fine, casting her witch magic on the kids and on him. Moreover, the kids teased him, saying that he couldn’t get home on time to the point that they had to eat his share of the food, using that as ammo that they were stronger and could easily go out into the wilderness easily. Because of these two reactions, Goldberg laughed, but he also was reminded again that even with everyone depending on him, his family thought he was silly.\nTime was falling short, and everyone was growing slowly. Sooner or later, the world would be a brighter place.\nBut he had to be wary.\nIf one person died, that would lead to so many things happening all at once.\nCharles Finch was one of them.\nHis death contributed to John Roger giving up his proxy adventurers that James Boulevard was now with the New Adventurers.\nJohn Roger was now returning to the shadows, while other nobles began claiming the vacuum of adventurism among the officials.\nAnyway, Goldberg sat down and began to fish—an activity absentmindedly suggested by some of the officials when he subtly mentioned his boredom with his hero status.\nA river stood before him. Even if it was big and flowing hard, he began fishing there, using the help of one of his companions to make sure that the rod was stable.\nThe fish underwater were also powerful enough to fight the waves, so when they saw the bait, they tried to get it.\nThe fish danced in the river, and every moment was special, because they each had the chance of rewarding enchanted items, being a unique feature of fishing.\nGoldberg didn’t get anything today, and that was okay.\nProgressing into another issue, Sarah and Mary stared at Elizabeth, who was still in her undead state after dying to poison. They didn’t know how to interact with half of what Elizabeth used to be, and the fact that Charles Finch died under their guidance made things awkward with John Roger, who was no longer their boss. They were now idly sitting nearby, passing by on the other side of the river Goldberg was fishing at. They didn’t mind him, heading into their own personal business.\nReturning to Goldberg, Evernight and Saddest, two of his current companions, sang a song, soothing him.\nChapter 41 - Reflections and Realizations: Goldberg’s Respite Amidst Turmoil linkGoldberg sat down, resting his hand on his laps. “I don’t remember sitting here for this long, but today might be a good day.”\nThe sky was bright open around him.\nHe didn’t have to rush things, and he could live in the present.\nHe grabbed a pickaxe and began attacking a tree with it.\nThe tree didn’t budge, but it allowed Goldberg to relax and get his body going.\nEvernight stood next to him.\nGoldberg didn’t know what else to do right now.\nSo he got up and placed his hand on his head as a way to get his mind working. He wanted his soul to be free for now.\nHe lived too long in this dry and weary world.\nThis was where he had control from the fast life of this world, everything eating him up alive. This was the only time he was able to do something different.\nHe walked around, finding the trees beautiful. He didn’t want to waste too much time here.\nBut his heart was pulled in many directions.\nHe soon ended at one idea—he went to a cave and grabbed a crate on which to sit.\nHe let the air fill his lungs.\nNot a single moment wasted.\nThis was his break.\nThe wind danced.\nHe allowed the leaves to flow with it.\nHe let go of his burdens and past worries.\nThe time was now.\nHe had too much time on his hands, and he knew that whatever happened, it would only burden him more.\nHe lay down instead of forcing something productive to happen.\nThis break was most productive right now.\nHe lay down on his belly, keeping his arms supporting his head and face off the ground.\nToo many things had happened in one month, and this was his well-deserved rest.\nHe crawled around like he was a baby.\nHe approached a tree and grabbed at it like he didn’t know how to grasp things with his fingers.\nHe became like a snail or a worm.\nHe fully immersed himself in this role.\nHe was ripping apart the past events on which he had never gotten a sense of true closure.\nHe lay on his back, appreciating the blue sky, which was mostly empty except for the many, large clouds at the horizon.\nHe climbed a hillock, almost tripping on the slope.\nHe had to rush with a limited number of steps lest he lost his balance and momentum.\nAt the top of the hillock, he looked around, finding his adventurer companions staring at him confusedly.\nGoldberg kept walking around with his eyes focused at what was right in front of him or below him, even dancing awkwardly at times.\nA color of lights filled the air—the natural landscape enamoured him.\nHe gradually slept with the earth.\nHe woke up and returned to resting around, walking like a turtle as he sat down next to a tree on a hillock, holding the tree on it.\nThe leaves and spiky grass confronted him with warnings of a coming danger.\nHe stood up, unaware the goblins had arrived at the scene.\nThe adventurers, troubled, didn’t notice that winged goblins were flying above.\n“What are those!” said one of the adventurers, casting a freezing spell to block the purple magical attacks aimed at Goldberg.\nGoldberg stared quietly before he retreated. He had never been particularly strong in combat, always an adventurer first and a soldier never.\nThe goblins were in a formation, organized.\nThe adventurers began falling one by one to the magical onslaught.\nGoldberg fell as well, but he was able to escape with the help of a scroll that teleported a mile away.\nThe world would never hear of the time Goldberg almost died, because a nearby group of goblins grabbed and imprisoned him.\nGoldberg stared. “Why am I in in prison again? Are you the Marchachas? Why? Why? I already told you we’d be working together starting today. What happened!”\nThe goblins were silent.\nGoldberg raised his head in exasperation before he flinched with fear at the sudden slamming of his cage against a giant door.\nThis was the door leading to his new home.\nIt was a place of development, and many goblins were beginning to harness golem workers.\nThey wanted Goldberg to verify himself to the golem that all goblins were human enough to be allowed access to the golem’s mental control room.\nBut Goldberg was against the idea of helping an enemy.\nHowever, the goblins were insistent, poking him everyday and night with spikes with the goal of keeping him from repurchasing sanity.\nBut he was resolute, maintaining his focus in this dark time.\nGoldberg calmed his breath, glancing at the smooth way the spikes hit him and how he was struck with ease. The pain was brutal, but he wasn’t going to be stuck there forever.\nGoldberg didn’t want to be rescued, but he also didn’t see a way out.\nHe realized this was not going to be easy, kicking the cages and finding that they opened easily.\nThe Marchacha goblins’ representative, Kahul, emerged and appeared, the goblins who had captured Goldberg lined up and bowing toward Kahul. “This is our Saint, who teacheth us in the ways of the Goblin Goddess.”\nGoldberg didn’t want to understand what he just heard, because he just wanted Kahul to clear the misunderstanding quickly. “Hey man. I really need to get out. I know you’re their boss and it can—”\nKahul unlocked his cage and cut him free.\nGoldberg saw the light of day again only after half a day. But it was dying and losing its brightness, as the mood led to the night.\nHe discovered that Kahul had built a pretty home for himself and his fellow goblins.\nGoldberg sat down and had tea before he returned to the place where the adventurers had died.\nHe stared at them before puking. Evernight and Saddest were also dead.\nHe covered his face.\n“I haven’t… even begun to tell him where they were going to eat after they returned. And now, they are… It’s like their brains are gone.” These brains were literally ruined.\nGoldberg took a deep breath. “What I should do is report this to the adventurer guild.”\nThere, the guild said they would be sending information-gathering troupes to get a reading or status of a particular area, specifically the place where Goldberg’s adventurer companions had died.\nAfter Goldberg returned home, he said hi to his kids and his wife. He didn’t think that today could not have gotten any way worse.\nAt least he was still alive.\nHe was too detached and disoriented to know what was happening. All the details didn’t make sense when put together sometimes.\nHe rubbed his eyes and fell asleep.\nThe next morning, he was then sent to his roll call place, where he would then be moving to many different places.\nHe visited the barracks, the place where many people ate, the noble estates, and the tree and bee farms where the King served his most delicious honey, among others.\nMeanwhile, Billy mined several rocks, finding uncommon ores for the first time after encountering only common cores.\nHe showed it to the trainer, who said that if he sold it, he wouldn’t need to work as a miner. He could work as a merchant.\nBilly didn’t want that, so he kept mining, an allowance for apprentice trainers emerging in response to this effort.\nOne of Billy’s spells allowed him to see ores 200 meters away through the walls.\nThough, he didn’t know how valuable it was, but he knew that it could work in favor of the regulations of the city that demanded a limit on how much rock could be removed. Basically, the more streamlined their mining process was, the more less they had to mine to get the ores they actually cared about, which aligned with the regulatory limit. This limit was actually only introduced recently after the Just attack because the city wanted to curry favor with other cities part of a magical sustainability agreement. It was unsolicited, but the city wanted to show they were willing to adapt in order to be the little brother other cities needed in this particular part of the region, given that they were hit very badly in the attack. In a time of post-crisis and recovery, they had to compromise a lot to make sure cities didn’t let go of their support and collaboration structures here. Even if the limitations introduced were not necessarily logical, it was compatible with the other cities’ agendas—cultural factors, political considerations, and strategic objectives.\nAnyway, shifting to Notch, he was getting tired of mining. Even now, he still remembered dragging the scared Billy outside after they did the job with Maverick, but now he was the one who needed dragging to the mines. It was not that difficult, but it was getting boring to him.\nHe wanted to check out from this apprenticeship altogether, but he didn’t have anything else to do. This was his new life now he felt.\nHe talked to Billy about it.\nBilly said: “Hey, Notch, listen up, alright? We gotta keep going, keep pushing through this mining apprenticeship, you hear me? We’re almost there, man, almost done with this whole thing. Just gotta keep chipping away, keep hammering down, until we’ve smashed through it all. I’m talking about real dedication here, like we’re on some epic quest or something. Like, seriously, it’s adventure time, no kidding around. We gotta charge ahead, fighting on like a soldier, you know? That’s where the real magic happens, the best stuff ever. It’s like, incredible, exhilarating, unbelievable… Yeah! So let’s do this, Notch, let’s conquer this mining world together!”\nNotch—who had been the one to convince Billy and Shadrach to go on Maverick’s job, the job where they first met and worked together—smiled at Billy’s words. “Maybe, I will,” he said.\nAfter they disappeared into the land and became a part of its fabric, moving on to Goldberg, he continued hunting down a sense of self through it all. It wasn’t Notch, Billy, and Shadrach’s time to wonder about that, because they were still exploring the world at their young age. Though, Billy was the one most mature, being 18 years old among the 13-year-old Shadrach and 14-year-old Notch—even if he sounded the least mature; it was because he was more mature that he could display a more childishly optimistic and curious demeanor while still understanding internally what was and what needed to be done. Moreover, he displayed himself strategically instead of just trying to appear jaded for the sake of appearance and the perceived status of an adult. To explain this strategy, Shadrach and Notch had gone through traumatic experiences, leaving them a little jaded, and Billy was there to remind them again of what it was like to be a child again strategically through his demeanor to make sure their growth was well-rounded instead of rushed. In any case, Goldberg, being in his late thirties, was old enough to go through streamlined internal explorations marked by in-depth feelings, feeling that all his explorations of the world had temporarily blinded him to his own soul. Today was a good time to relax after all those external changes in his life, even as a father to two kids and a husband to a strong woman.\nMeanwhile, Sprutnoa stared at the silence, holding a magical artifact, as he shouted at the laborers in front of him: “Do you seriously, seriously think that this is just one big joking thing. Am I going to sit down and watch you take your little breath and speak? Do you want, do you want to speak? Do you want to experience Nirvana, or some experience. Do you want to… become… a-a-a-a-a dog? Do you want to live a good life and experience Joy Everlasting? Well, try harder.” He didn’t want them to be impatient and slow near a junction where beasts could come out. Even with the barriers, he wanted to be careful. His method of warning them was by adopting this demeanor.\nShifting to Billy and the rest of the apprentice miners, since their mine was increasing in size. Actual miners were being introduced slowly overtime to get used to the place and begin refining it as a potential adventurer hub, so that meant more action and danger due to the increasing size and vulnerability to monster infestation. In fact, monsters were already there, roaming around in clumps around the tight cave; they were fighting over spots and blocking each other, a continuous brawl occurring there as soon as the mine connected to a larger dungeon cave network.\nThis took a long time, as the city had limited resources. Even if caves did indeed hold magical resources, they still required time to process, and as of the moment, many mages, including blacksmiths and skilled craftsmen, who processed their own ores and loot had lost their lives in the Just attack. This was why the city was slow at the moment. Their closest ally and supporter in this process was the nearest city, Juntyno city, who invested funds into helping them restore their essential adventuring infrastructure as part of an intention to facilitate interconnectivity between major dungeons across the horizon better. Juntyno’s intentions involved ensuring that their adventurers could safely migrate and travel across the region, especially given that Antipolo City bordered various dungeon-rich areas while still being close enough to keep travel costs relatively cheap.\nIn the end, everyone was still navigating a world; it could be said that not too much had changed since the day before. But things were progressing gradually.\nAuthor note:\nThis chapter marks the end of a 10-chapter introduction (chapter 32 to 41) to the second arc. It was intentional that the introduction was more so of consolidation and cohesion-building with its vignette or snippet-scene style and day-by-day overview of the city through the perspectives of the main character per chapter style. The next chapters after that will be a lot more ambitious, involving more in-depth exploration and detail, even more so than the first arc, each chapter consisting of 25,000 words average. This means that this story will no longer be published everyday, but every week.\nChapter 42 - Innocence Unbound: The Resilience of Youth Amidst a Changing World link Author’s Note:\nOkay, for anyone coming in later, I just realized I had a duplicate of chapter 4 in chapter 5. I might have made a mistake while copying it onto Royalroad. So now, the actual chapter 5 is up. I apologize for the inconvenience. I appreciate your understanding.\nWhen it came to the idea of visions, one adventurer saw a bright light shining in the horizon. As for what it meant, it said: “An army is coming.” Regarding his response, he used a sense that this light was guiding him as a promise of good luck. And this vision was real. In conclusion, he contrasted the everyday adventurer who wanted to return home and procure a fresh drink.\nTransitioning to a figurative note, the sun rushed down upon the earth, its flashing lights accumulating through the fissures, chasms, and crevices of the cloth fabric of a tent like sediment.\nIn an incidental snapshot, within this tent, an older man’s buttocks weighed heavily against a flat wooden-chair, the seat of which was hastily nailed, so the man could still feel the gaps between the planks and the nails and irregularities on the chair.\nContinuing the figurativeness with a blend between it and realism, a young woman’ fingers fiddled with papers as heavy as rocks, her legs and back pressing neatly against her seat, her hands manipulating the papers’ rotations and positions. With a heavy head, her eyes shot over the pile of papers lying below her on a makeshift table; her posture encroaching like a spider entrapping a rod; her shoulders stretching endlessly to make up for the unsuitability of her setup with her body shape. Thirdly, the curtains of the tent flapped against several chests resolutely moved to the edges; the lingering musty and muddy smell a consequence of their intermittent across-the-camp transportation, as the tent was part of a camp.\nIn another incidental snapshot, it was also attached to a nearby road leading to a city, so crates and wagons hailed from there.\nEither way, the loud taste of bread danced along the tips of a chair, a chest, and a group of boxes being haggled along by the surface of a trolling wagon. Fifthly, the sunny buttons on men’s dresses pressed to and fro like a rowing paddler on a seaside trip. The smell of fresh waters pushed farther and farther up, reaching the hair covers of men’s noses and zooming right up inside. Sixthly, the rubbing of fresh seeds rinsing and bathing themselves with water on the pond and the nearby dewy vegetation and leaves scratched a man’s ear. Seventhly, the flowery pots made their way downtown, riding a wagon, a gift from the men to their families back home. Eighthly, The sight of fresh reds upon the sunset and idyllic greens of nature combined like knights reunited. Ninthly, the balance of the road trembled as various undulations dug themselves into the green road, withdrawing and releasing the feet of men. Lastly, the gravel and screes yelled in friendly greeting whenever the feet of men shook them.\nDiverging into a more grounded camp conversion, in a space between several tents, several adventurers spoke, watching the silence. “Where’s Matteo?”\nMatteo was hiding in the corner of a bush, his arms resting against his hips, his head lowered, his face still, his mind at ease. Entering into his mind, he noticed that none of the adventurers truly spoke; they only engaged their environment in words. He wondered if this world was fake, and everything he knew wasn’t real.\nBut maybe he was wrong.\nReapproaching reality, the adventurers found him, their gazes wandering by and testing his resolve.\nHe had been hiding away from the lights, from the people, and from the expectations placed upon him. But now he was, returned to this order of hierarchical life—not freedom of aloneness but freedom characterized by a sense of purpose.\nMatteo didn’t know what was going to happen. It was just an ordinary day. Nothing had to change. He just wanted to relax and have fun. And he was already struggling as it was. He just needed to relax. Nothing was going to happen.\nDrifting away from these people and visiting the perspective of the man inside the tent earlier, he was Goldberg. He sat down on a chair, his lips curled with slight disappointment, determination, and a sense of purpose and place, placing a notepad on a desk.\nAs he began to relax, he absentmindedly noticed the scratches, cracks, and grooves on the wooden surface of the many sides the desk visually contained.\nEach imperfection indicated a rich history beyond his years and understanding and memories that never seemed to end; a humanity, personalities upon personalities—humanities upon humanities.\nIt stimulated his five senses. First, the sound of his finger brushing and scratching lightly against the wooden surface glimpsed paper, feather, and leather, among other reminiscent materials found on a desk. Second, the bitter taste of wood hailing from memories of biting it as a child appeared on his tongue, leaving a strange aftertaste of emotional raucousness. Third, the texture of both the touch and sound of rubbing his fingers and palms together cast doubt on the idea that he was himself. Fourth, when he made two fingers posture outward with one finger pressing against a nail from the top and another pushing it from the bottom, forming a circular hole, he released the pressure, and it gave him two sensations: a quiet, crisp sound of release and the softened edge of the hard, clean texture of his fingernail after the skin of his thumb rubbed across it. Fifth, he rubbed the folds on the back of his fingers like he did when he was a child, studying the overlapping quality of these folds like armies tied together hanging from the spearhead of a leader. Sixth, the smell of intense street food outside saw the vivid past scenes of patience, hunger, and thirst at many places and events. Seventh, the scale of a tent and how much space his earlier self had playing around while his mother and father focused on work loomed over him. Eighth, numerous people walked outside into his view. He now perceived outside as a place to travel through and not as the magical vastness that he didn’t understand yet as a child. Maybe, now, he was still learning. Ninth, whenever his hands touched a quill, he found himself delicately tickling himself with the edges of those feathers. Tenth, he remembered the simple scribbles he did on papers and how often he explored things by drawing them and writing them down, without really understanding the broader decades-long firsthand context of what they meant and could mean. Eleventh, he visualized how it affected his understanding of the world and how every idea became succinct in this focused environment and process. Twelfth, he remembered the thousands of memories of living through this world and how they wrapped up everything while leaving him with a sense of incompletion and disjointedness. These were all things he did and experienced as a growing and learning child. And this was only the tip of the iceberg. All those experiences existed in a tucked-away chest waiting to be opened with the sound of gold jingling. Or maybe they were everywhere in the universe, never to be comprehended again.\nReturning to reality, he left the tent he was in and looked outside, seeing a large army in the distance.\n“What is point of this?” he said. “Can we end this fight?\n“Why do we each have to fight?\n“Can we not just be friends? In another life, could we have been friends?\n“Please… tell me… where do these memories go?\n“The potential friendships and memories we could have made.\n“The connections that are left wandering through the hollow rooms and the places and areas and beautiful forests that only seek after that sense that maybe there was someone there—a couple of people together, a group, a mass, a community, a love, a life. People together. Are we seriously going to lose this again and again? Tell me… am I going to have to bear this again and again?”\nHe didn’t want to do this anymore.\nAfter having lost, Goldberg felt that it was only right to try again, his fingers wrapping around his quill with will power.\nEventually, at the later battle, he raised his sword formally, while goblins swarmed about, their feet carving the earth and distilling the mud with the sweat dripping down them. They giggled ravenously.\n“I am the Demolisher,” Goldberg then said, the angels embracing his arms and becoming their wings.\nWhen the goblins approached close enough, he, within range, slashed and sliced before dragging his blade through the earth as a gesture of greatness. His mud-laden sword was smacked against the goblins, dousing them with mud and blinding them with a dots of brown as scattered as a scree of stones.\nFrom the goblins’ side, they struck back at him, arrows falling from their bows, flashes of fiery energy bursting out, reflecting transformations and magical awakenings. They were gaining in numerical advantage.\nIn response, Goldberg gravelly, guttural voice pummeled: “You will not live through this!” He motivated himself first and foremost before releasing the hunting blade.\nAutomatically, he slashed and removed their heads by splintering their shields, armor, helmets, and neck skin. He pierced these neck skins open into two halves, letting blood taste the blade edge. The sword drank the blood in multiple fulls before flying across the rest of their bodies and turning them askew too.\nIn the meantime, the goblins stayed behind, raging upon the trees and screeching, while Goldberg advanced forth, raising his hand and mocking them with an offensive gesture.\nHe launched himself into the fray, breaking and splitting through thick and padded cloth before tapping the bodies. “I am the individual!” he said, retaining a sense of self amid the chaos of the past events.\nAs soon as he came close enough, the goblins grabbed his blade and pushed it away, distancing themselves. They kept the pressure, discouraging the adventurers’ formations’ integrity with multi-target magical attacks.\nEven after being pushed back, Goldberg slashed them again and again, spinning, whirling along, his sword dashing in perfect synchrony around his arms and through the grasps of his hands in agreement with his arms’ motions. It was tender and delicate, but the end result was devastation.\nEventually, however, the goblins put pressure on him, alerting Goldberg to retreat and avoid a direct confrontation for now.\nBut Goldberg couldn’t retreat. Instead, he adapted by dragging his blade against the mud before spraying it against the goblins, giving them pause.\nThen, he span his sword, getting momentum.\nNow that he had space to move, he chose to retreat, his blade drawing an arc along behind him, as he dragged it back into control.\nSimultaneously, from the side, a goblin leapt out, which Goldberg smashed into the ground like an insect before he proceeded running.\nAs the goblins neared and began attacking him, Goldberg ultimately fell to the earth, having exhausted himself.\nFrom the distance, blasts of magic flew, striking several goblins and freezing them where they choked to death rapidly.\nThe goblins were armed, running about, the blasts flying and darting upon them. They dodged and avoided it, their forces shifting and churning in formation. They soon came upon a stop, growing slower as time ticked toward the end.\nReinforcements had come.\nSuddenly, Goldberg raised his hand. “Let this be the day of vengeance!” Hundreds came following his lead, and he dashed forward, swirling and making a wave across them.\nHe danced upon Northe Road, moving around, shaking. His hands stretched out and then rotated in a loop. His hands bounced from left to right. He made a wave with his arms, alternating between left and right in a specific pattern: 1-1-2-1-1-2. He raised his head above himself and lowered himself to the ground, bending his knees before standing back up again. He spun around, whirling his arms around, kicking his legs to the back. He began striding in place and swinging his arms in an exaggerated manner, dancing.\nHeavenly might fell upon his arms, his hands flying with clumsy spills, his arm growing in proportion to his faith in this process. Magical particles blessed the swords of the humans, as their arms flew out.\nOn impact, Goblins fell apart and combusted, exploding in bones, blood, and brain matter.\nThe first line of goblins were gone, so the rest of the goblins retreated to regroup, sweat dripping down their temples, chin, shoulders, and bellies. Their heart was stuck between life and shock; very energetic.\nThe goblins began meditating, calling upon the rainy season wind, a gentle breeze rustling through leaves and across grass, accompanied by the soft patter of raindrops on various surfaces.\nThey wanted to live through this, but they wanted to claim the reward of an adventurer’s death.\nGoldberg’s army kept charging.\nHowever, one of the goblins that stared at Goldberg said, his voice magically intensified in strength: “Do you sincerely believe that we haven’t prepared for the likes of you? Or the likes of this battle? We do not wage a useless war. We do not fight on the terms of a need for violence or a need to give you a reputation. We fight because we know our strengths, and those goblins who have given their lives? They were our oldest, and they have chosen to give up their lives to be turned undead and to throw their lives to convince your friends to come. That is why we have won.”\nThe air grew thick with magical fog, as Goldberg and all his allies suddenly fell unconscious.\nThe goblin who had spoken was a simple-looking goblin named “Roots.” He was one of John Roger’s new goblin men, as he wanted to establish a paramilitary force outside the state.\nIncidentally, if Goldberg was awake, he would have grinned sarcastically at himself and said: “Okay then… Okay then…”\nAnyway, Roots stared, the silence consuming him and everything around him.\nHe disappeared, and he reappeared as a human being. He could shapeshift, and he was not really a goblin. That was why John Roger hired him. He was an adventurer who helped goblins get in and out of the barriers, but he was originally an adventurer who spied on goblins. But things had changed, and now he was helping the goblins.\nMoving to the background and the rest of the goblins, the heat burned the earth, sweat dripping heavily and rapidly.\nThe goblins wanted to flee from the sun.\nBut it beamed its rays with hatred. It would not let go, declaring ownership of them.\nThe adventurers, including Goldberg, were dumped into wagons and dragged away.\nGoldberg’s still face conveyed the disappointment and nihilistic feelings he would have felt if he was awake and seeing this scene.\nReturning to Roots, he rubbed his face with the side of his hand, tired of the itches on his face.\nHe gritted his teeth and rode the wagon, standing on one of the unconscious lying adventurers’ body.\nSimilarly, the goblins were all standing on the bodies, creating a strange, surreal scene as many wagons carrying the same lying bodies and group of standing goblins magically rode in a single direction up the hilly slopes from different starting points within a single area.\nThey disappeared, blending with time and the landscape.\nThe city was still in a state of recovery, and the goblins were already acting with impunity.\nLater, elsewhere, in front of a large fort, the wagon-riding goblins got down, saying hi, waving, greeting with gestures.\nThe fort accepted them, gates opening.\nWithin the fort, goblins were surrounding various stalls in variedly designed sections of the fort; this place serving more like a small town corner with segmented stall blocks and nicely fitted dirt roads, many layers of society clumped together in a single unit of community. First, anonymous goblin mages wearing hooded tunics that covered their whole body save for their hands walked around in threes. Second, kids trained in the art of producing potions followed wagons and said hi to the travelers and returners, their hands still black with potion-making magic side effects. Third, giant golems were being lassoed and dragged along, their forms making no damage when touching the buildings due to the weakening magical effect established upon their strength, their lassoers little goblins who were tossed into special chambers that maximized their [Capturing] stat, a particular attribute within their status page that allowed them to tame golems and control them. Fourth, tall goblins were raising ornaments, being thousands of bird remains clipped into shapes, upon lines across the town as part of a magical effect controlling how much the goblins urinated. Basically, it made it so that they didn’t have to urinate as much by converting their urine into odorless air as a buff. Fifth, goblins who were lying on the road were checking the goblins walking by. Due to a certain magic, they couldn’t move their body much, only being able to lie down. But the benefit was that anybody that walked near them were immediately magically assessed for their health, wellbeing, and for any negative effects. If anything was wrong with them, they would begin to glow to show another group of goblins that they had to be sent to a room for healing. Sixth, the goblins were constantly affected with a spell that made their healing twice as strong, but it also came at the cost of sucking a third of the mana of all goblins within the fort. It was clear that a fort had this spell when it had a monster statue in the middle.\nSoon, transitioning to Goldberg, he woke up in a jail cell, hundreds of adventurers lined up in a line at his left in similar cells.\nThe goblins were immediately there as soon as he woke up, placing cups and plates for them to eat in before they dumped slop on their plates.\nGoldberg was confused, because he was expecting to be tortured.\nHe ate it up and told his fellow adventurers to be careful about casting magic, because they might have set up some form of anti-magic or trigger to kill the caster.\nOne of the fellow adventurers, after being pressured to do so, cast magic, and a large hammer appeared out of thin air and smashed him to death.\nGoldberg didn’t understand this.\nIt didn’t make sense for this sequence of events to unfold.\nHe was just relaxing in the corner of a room, and all of a sudden, he was here.\nHe tried to get out, because he felt that this was all a farce—a joke.\nIt wasn’t supposed to be this way. When did things go wrong? He was just relaxing, and all of a sudden, Evernight and Saddest died. All of a sudden, a large army was in front of him, and he was told to be present because the goblins were being arrogant again. “What is happening?”\nBut he was here in prison.\nHe realized that the goblin’s system of integrating adventurers into their territory was swift, clean, and natural to them, while disorienting, sudden, and disjointed in the adventurers’ eyes.\nThe goblins immediately placed wards and other forms of tracking their opponents in the area. They also added various goblins to keep watch in case. They assembled portals in which the goblins could go from their hiding spots to a safe distance outside the fort. They made sure to place various barriers maintained by magical artifacts all around the location where they got Goldberg.\nThey were much more prepared and mechanized.\nThe goblins had artifacts that Goldberg’s group was not aware of, because many adventurers tended to avoid smaller and weaker dungeons due to their easy and the lengthy duration it took to go through and finish them. But the goblins grabbed the scraps and soon found themselves at an advantage due to their every-nook-and-cranny approach, one that focused on the minor details and strategic points, resulting in an insiduous progression toward superiority in this area. However, the adventurers could eliminate them easily; however, Goldberg was surprised twice. He made the same mistake, thinking that simply a larger force would fix the issue. The goblins punished their mistakes, using guerilla warfare and loose and unorganized control with a focus on the the unknown dungeons and control points.\nIn the end, Goldberg was defeated.\nIn the meantime, one of the adventurers with him, Jashuki, as a former intelligence officer, didn’t understand why the hell the adventurer system coordinated by the city didn’t provide contingencies for this kind of goblin threat. Was it not compatible with the current methodologies with regard to adventuring and adventurer-adjacent theory available? How did the goblin incident not get flagged beforehand? Were the detectors (intelligence gatherers), both literal and framework-wise, not comprehensive enough to dampen the attack’s impact? However, he recognized that the response mechanisms which involved their arrival as reinforcements for the Goldberg were rudimentary and that sooner or later, the effective lack of resources and manpower instrumentalized by the Just attack would prove to be a detriment. Naturally, with weakened and exhausted power, the complexity of the interposed mechanisms underlying prevention (defence) would revisit basics proportionally, but that didn’t free the relevant leaders from liability.\nThe city was very vulnerable; in fact, the entire region was likely similarly so, if concerns like these couldn’t be handled. That meant the goblins were growing their metaphorical explosive shrooms in their backyard in plain sight without anyone noticing at all. The goblins had to be immediately punished, and the influence, encompassing ideology, philosophy, intelligence, skill, visual signatures, and leaders, that led to this incident had to be removed.\nWhile Jashuki continued to recall details, Goldberg raised his hand to reach the ceiling as he leaned against the bars, looking like he ate several rocks initially as a dare and then actually swallowed them, getting the tummy achies.\nHe wanted to go back to watching tournament games and taking his time off just reading books. He had never read books, but Priscilla did. And he was so bored he might actually do it.\nBut to be honest, he was using the word “bored” because he was concerned about getting tortured or being killed. But the goblins didn’t look too mean.\nHe was downplaying the situation, he knew.\nSimultaneously, the situation outside was demanding, each goblin being expected to continue down the path of optimal functioning. But goblins were given breaks; that was why comfort and familiarity was a fundamental aspect of its foundation.\nIf Goldberg was aware of this, he would find it very difficult not to respect them. He had a slight aversion to trolls after the 48-casualty incident, but when it came to goblins, he saw them as very dangerous animals that needed to be put down immediately. If he saw them like this, he would hesitate.\nSuddenly, despite Jashuki only leaving his strategic intelligence in his head, he was dragged out of his cage. After they informed him that he would be used to help direct their forces in an upcoming fight with soldiers, Jashuki’s eyes were wide as saucers. When did they know? Did they know? Was it a lucky guess? Were they actually killing him?\nThe goblins put him in an open tent where a large group of organized formally dressed goblins were standing, considering Jashuki’s expertise.\nJashuki’s face was pale. How did they get access to his files?\nHe knew strategy and how to arrange a draft with counters and overall composition well, and if he was asked to, he could easily give orders in minute detail within an active dynamic battlefield.\n“So… which one among these actually produce an effect?”\n“An effect…” he said contemplatively. He saw a very, very obvious arrangement on the map. They used magically floating cards as a way to identify different units, so he got big information on their forces. And the map was very minute in scope, so he didn’t know the location shown.\nHe pointed at a particular path and said that depending on how competent the units were, they could reach optimal route within 5 or 6 minutes, allowing them to deny the enemy flank positioning and magical set-up advantage due to the increased mana present in that section. This was simplified, but if he knew the exact methods, resources, and equipment used, then he would make a more accurate assessment.\n“So that’s how powerful your forces are.”\nJashuki’s mouth shook very slightly with shock.\nThe commander continued, “We wouldn’t be able to do this without your… Shroud.”\nJashuki furrowed his brows to hide his surprise. He made that earlier strategic conclusion assuming that Shroud was a fundamental part of a battlefield; however, he didn’t take into account the possibility that some goblin tribes or groups weren’t able to harness the Shroud.\nThe commander concluded, “Why don’t we take your Rasudy on that same route then, since that’s likely where your Rasudi is located.”\nJashuki didn’t know how to explain anything to suggest otherwise. He had revealed his cards by mistake, helping them finish up the process of elimination. He wanted to show off his knowledge without revealing anything earlier, but he failed.\nHe shut himself down emotionally and mentally, waiting for them to move on.\nSoon, the goblin commander caught the adventurers off guard by targeting the Rasudi, a particular buff structure that empowered the adventurers, raining down arrows at the desperate, scattered adventurers that had planned on collapsing where they expected the goblin main force would be. It wasn’t just the Rasudi.\nTo simplify, the goblins had 5 main forces.\nTo explore in detail, several of them were more typical infantry soldiers intended to help scatter fire and make it harder for the enemy to muster a focused gaze. This way, they could help put together teams positioned around the flanks behind the groves of trees. It was slower, but they were terrain-specialized soldiers. Several hundred mana stones were arranged for continuous fire to put a stand-in in the fight before the main troops collapsed around the middle. It was expected that they would both have mana stones to channel a barrage of magic from. However, this was also layered with special considerations on the adventurers’ part; such as a spell that could create trenches almost instantly, a spell that could make tens of soldiers invisible, and a spell that could break open a line of troops by making them fall unconscious with little to no way of stopping it, bypassing projectile-directed magical shields. But even in close quarters combat, there were master fighters like Jashuti, a man who could bring ten opponents down if he was given a line of opponents, which forced enemies to separate very loosely while taking cover from sudden barrages or close quarters magical and physical projectile shots if necessary. People like Jashuti could stall the whole fight and allow those whom a slower pace benefitted to execute their plans faster, forcing the entire battlefield into making riskier decisions and where they began dying in the numbers.\nIt could get more complicated than that, as the fight happened in multiple angles and levels of awareness, with those moving closer to their strategic locations losing time rapidly and gaining more desperation as their life-or-death situation zoomed nearer.\nThe commander was not at all worried, as Jashuki himself revealed much about the adventurers that he didn’t know, leaving most of the fight happening quickly.\nFor a double-sided ambush done with a noticeable distance of separation between goblins and adventurers, the goblins used the Rasudi again after disabling it because they knew that it had a temporary effect of intense slowness on the adventurers. Even if it buffed the adventurers, they used it to finish off the adventurers and keep them in suspended position while they were bombarded with charges. The slowness and buff affected the goblins as well now that they were within range upon its turning-on, but the goblin charges were advantaged due to the adventurers’ in-progress regrouping as an awkward formation. Moreover, the goblins were specialized with dashing skills that ignored slowness effects, but the adventurers were varied in composition, with different specializations shoulder-to-shoulder, resulting in their quick, front-to-back defeat.\nRasudi were immediately lowered down, put down, and disassembled. Their point here was to make sure that its buffs were disabled as soon as possible. They could just use magic to deactivate it, but doing it this way made it much faster.\nWhen they reached the area where the Rasudi was earlier, it was a remote place, so they had lots of time to prepare and disassemble it.\nUltimately, they won.\nHighlights included the time they used the Rasudi to kill a large group of adventurers; the time they killed Jashuti, a remote-lane bruiser (“a durable fighter who dealt consistent damage and excelled in close quarters combat, intended to be independent and self-sufficient in isolation as a duelist in one-on-one confrontations”), by pitting him within an intersection of several trenches using the trench-making spell and then surprising him by crowding him with goblins that were already headed in his direction anyway during a moment when the adventurers had their focus on what they perceived to be a very vulnerable main force; and the time they left a side of the main force vulnerable to catch them off guard with hidden flanks, the hints of which were downplayed. This fake vulnerability was layered with a double circular formation meant to scoop up the invisible adventurers and preclude the spell that made a line of targets fall unconscious. The caster for this spell was killed before he could find an effective timing to use it.\nWhen it came to the adventurers’ perspective, they wanted to get the goblins quickly because they were 99% sure the goblins were regrouping after disabling the Rasudi. They didn’t expect the goblins to be much more aggressive and actually sending it.\nThey started the fight laying out the soldiers with a more defensible position, focusing on taking over the goblins side through layering a few primary positions and blocking flanks with well-placed dynamic actors. This way, they could focus a barrage of spells and destroy the enemies by usurping wide-scale control and advantage immediately. Pushing enemies to their defences and forcing them to regroup at their defences was their goal because it was easier for them to siege a single target than to have the enemies chip away at their force through drawing them in. Instead, they would force the goblins to retreat to their defences, giving them zero time to draw them into unfavorable positions when they owned the land by that point. Furthermore, the adventurers couldn’t have the Rasudi at the primary positions because that made it obvious where it was, so they placed it at a distant spot. They also made sure their resources were separate and compartmentalized through different forces. The route that the goblins took was highly defensible, especially with the Shroud spell that made soldiers invisible in areas of smoke. But that was why they left it with little forces, only propping up a fake appearance of invulnerability. However, they did leave the Shroud spell caster with them because they expected the goblins to send a small group down the route anyway. They didn’t expect the goblin main force to go through that route, given the typical blitzkrieg close quarters approach assumed from adventurers.\nHowever, what ended happening was that their goal of making the goblins regroup became their disaster, and they didn’t expect the goblins to reach the Rasudi that they had tucked far away from their primary arms of attack. It wasn’t too far, so they immediately went there even if they were a little unorganized. But they hadn’t expected the goblins to be so fast. If the adventurers relied on their most defensible positions before the blitzkrieg approach, they would have shut down the goblins immediately. But the goblins had pivotal info on them.\nWhen they suddenly started losing, their goal was to stay back and look to re-engage them in favorable positions and angles, but the fight was long lost, having lost their key players.\nThis ended their streak of plans and left them on the dust.\nThe goblin pressed their advantage by moving into the outposts; they didn’t have forts positioned here. And the fortified hill they did have only had soldiers who were not used to goblins, since adventurers were the ones who dealt with them the most.\nGoblins marched forward, breaking land and crushing the tempo the soldiers sacrificed. The soldiers had intended to catch the goblins by overstaying and get even better tempo, but the goblins were used to these kinds of tactics, very wary of even the minor details being a minor species with minor forces themselves who only had the trivial things to keep them company.\nThe city began alerting the barracks.\nNameless was right, but he was wrong about the timing, just like the soldiers were.\nThe adventurers were being armed again; instead of using a typical army formation, they used a modular approach, each module a coalition, because they were used to coalitions rather than a unit even more complex and larger than them.\nThe city was being dared to fall.\nThe goblins were a tidal wave, their forces a diverse and multifaceted as their comprehensive experience as detail-finders and low-crawlers. It was ingrained into the psyche—the advantage that they now held over the city since the Just attack and the provisional loss of defensibility with recovery initiatives.\nThe city was taunted to fall.\nLater, back in his cell, Goldberg stared, saying, “What is happening…”\nAfter Goldberg was brought outside, he saw smoke in the distance.\n“Huh?”\nNearby, a goblin guard looked at him and provoked him: “You humans are so hard-headed.\n“You think you control everything. You talk of freedom and adventure.\n“You have no clue what you don’t know. You arrogance and complacency will be your downfall.”\nGoldberg shook his head instinctively.\nA group of goblin guards began mocking him in spades.\nThey were young and wanted something perfect to rally behind—a sense of purpose, a sense of place, and a sense of identity in a chaotic world that they were still taking years to accept, amid the disillusionment—so Goldberg didn’t find it unusual. He used to be like that.\nHe used to care about the individual, but his idealisms had taken a backseat because he had to deal with details and work. But he still felt that inside. It was just dormant.\nThe mocking goblins reminded him of what it was like to believe in something enough that one would do anything to defend it and fight for it in the face of opposition, ostracism, and persecution.\nBut that kind of thinking led to complicated real-life situations that left people complacent due to the challenges of maintaining a sense of self through the burden of the everyday, unappreciated struggle. But maybe he did feel strongly about things, but right now, he was still processing things.\nGoldberg was not like this usually.\nThis was not who he was, or at least who he knew himself to be. But this was who he was now amid who he had been.\nIt was like he was a child again, when everything was knew—\nAntipolo City had fallen.\nThe interplay of complacency and genuine belief in an idea, that being a city, overshadowed the practicalities of actual defensibility, both in intangible and tangible domains.\nGoldberg didn’t want this, but reality was often not what he thought it looked like. No one thought Antipolo could reach this low before the Just attack, but the Just attack had woken them up and made them realize that they weren’t the invulnerable city-state they thought they were. But it was only exacerbated by the proactivity of the goblins in their newfound advantage over the city.\nOnce “Antipolo would never fall!” was declared in the high places and in the mid and lower brackets of society, it was over—complacency had taken root. But it wasn’t just complacency. They really didn’t have the means to handle the Just attack, and it was unavoidable. And the goblins could be considered unavoidable as well as a consequence of their current weakened state. In fact, it didn’t have to be a matter of complacency, but of risk and reward.\nEither way, the nobles were imprisoned.\nThe thing about the goblins’ plan was that they didn’t execute every combatant in their way, making their war a step more defensible. Moreover, they made the transfer of power smooth by focusing on elevating the side of the humans that shared an aversion toward the adventurers, which, in this case, was the New Adventurers. They relied on this shared aversion to transition to a new state where these adventurer-hating humans were the new rulers. The goblins had only wanted to neuter the aggressiveness of this country represented by the extreme New Adventurers. In other words, they formed a more peace-oriented state by removing the aggressive faction. They didn’t care if the goblin-tolerant faction was significantly less skilled, organized, and able to uphold stable and fair governance, they only cared that it wasn’t anti-Goblin.\nSoon enough, Billy stared, hearing the sounds of a goblin soldier walking by. The adventurer friends of their trainer were dead, and the trainer himself was relocated to another role after they discovered his connections with the adventurers.\nIt was because everything had no closure and were in the middle of things that the goblin attack was so good.\nShifting to a desolate, metaphorical tone, Billy sat down, waving his hand back on forth, his heart beating slowly. His mind dancing with joy, he leapt, flying over the wall and becoming askew, an intangible form within his imagination. He saw the scale of change, and he saw the weight of the world floating farther and farther away from him. He rescinded his world-contacting limbs into himself. He removed the world from his mind, and he saw a great large area with the largest buildings only small things at the horizon. He danced and fell apart structurally, his soul becoming nonsensical. He read the books and found words that didn’t match his world. He fell away, becoming liquid, streaming down the road, his hair streaming back all the while, his thoughts streaming in. He became water.\nDrips of rainwater poured, callously beating against the earth, forming piles of mud. The greatness of the world disassembled itself and formed new rules and meanings until nothing was sensible and everything was inconsiderate of everything except itself.\nLarge buildings loomed, but all around was an empty mountainous landscape. Hundreds of years worth of memories streaming to nothingness; he laughed profusely, grating against the ears, jarring his spirit, turning him into a masseur of his own recovering soul.\nHe flew apart and became anew, each moment a strike against the thunderous earth where thunderstorms raged on to no end. He drifted away from all that, becoming ascended at an natural forested elevation. He climbed the hill, his heart pumping endlessly. He crashed to the valleys. He read the markings on the ground.\nHe danced until he dropped.\nThe world became ice, and he froze in its touch, picking up clumsily a small trinket which he held close against the sleeves that covered his hands, wrists, and arms. He held it against the sweat, as the heat poured inside. He sweated from his forehead, temples, shoulders, armpits, and sides of the belly. His back was the most sweaty. He walked out, away from the visual noise of his background.\nThe environment strung him along, beating him and lashing at him to move on.\nHe walked idly with a clumsy alternating half-step. He soldiered on.\nThe night poured like rain, furnishing his eyes until they were refined. He saw the figure of the goblins, but they were people who had always been there.\nHe envisioned a new reality, and it was not so.\nHe gradually disassembled himself, coalescing the only things that made sense into the internal chambers protected by the outer layers of these different parts of him. This way, he was sensible; though, it came at the cost of spending time in mindfulness and reflection for hours, even amid his duties.\nHis hands moved automatically.\nBut his world inwardly shown.\nMoving on to a more ambitious and urgent level, elsewhere, in the meantime, Shadrach began writing down notes with rapidity, slashing words upon the paper, crashing and burning words to permanence. He indefinitely poured his agency again and again until he mustered saluting text behind the battlements of word-art-creation—a definition of power.\nHe moved forward, raising his arm and clasping his hand into a fist. He was addicted to the grind, gnashing his teeth with determination.\nThe goblins clapped and awarded him, slowly putting him in various positions to interconnect various sections of their governance in the mining category. They placed colored banners upon his shoulders, imbuing him with agency and grace. He closed his eyes, a grin hidden at the bottom level of his face. He read their words and understood their intentions, and he was uplifted slowly and gradually above the masses. His agency was consummated.\nHe grabbed words and threw them aside, as his mouth spat commands that determined the positioning and role delegation and resource allocation with respect to his fellow humans. He knew that the goblins’ support would be ending a few months from now, so he maximized his grasp upon their offers of adjustment and “conquering the new land.” This was his chance to reach the heights. He would become an agent of swiftness.\nZooming into Notch, he finished a few day jobs before he got back home. It was a boring day, but he would pretty much eat the scraps and focus on getting back to speed with everyone if that was even possible. He needed some form of opportunity, and with the removal of the adventurers, he had no urgent rush. He only had menial day jobs, especially given that the city was still recovering and focused on cleaning up and returning to streamlined process, which took some risk sometimes but overall was a simple basic two-handed tools like pickaxes.\nOne day, on one on many days, in a similar manner to Billy, he woke up, glancing outside through the window; several kids played around him, their limbs flying through the air, their movements complex like nodes in a point-by-point system. Beat-by-beat sensations energized his standing up, his heart dispersing into the winds.\nHe went outside. The sky was bright, lonesome, and forlorn, ragged, a warm patina in his eyes; his fingertips seeking out flesh, his movements forward yet purposeful. A life beyond his form tethered him to the earth; a lovely tone shut up the dissonance of the new era.\nHe knew that this was the loss of more than a hundred years.\nHe sat down and tasted the earth with his skin, the hairs sensing the death all around. Cultures fell in response to stimulation, but new ones arose to replace them. Ideas became more nuanced, but their origins eluded the people. He hid within a ball-like form.\nHe walked outside, dots coloring the horizon like a painting, words collapsing into dust, flying voices married the shared vibe of this environment. Cursed violent thoughts were distant now; there where the memories lay.\nHe dissipated, his form becoming accursed. He hopped like a frog, his mouth opening and closing like heaven’s gates. He clasped his arm as he haggardly moved, stuck in suspended animation—a loop of the idle walking stride. He became transparent.\nHe soon became an after-image, imprinted on the scope of this world. He was no longer Notch but a blend of people, a representation of the common man and a never-ending tiresome journey unto death.\nThe silence was bequeathed to him.\nHe fell away like a figure magically turned to sand as part of an elaborate magical attack. He drifted then.\nThe sand particles that made him up crawled on the rainforest ground, climbing the mountainous steps of staircases, the looming statuesque figures of regular humans too hard to climb.\nThe image of separation; the bifurcation of his spiritual nature; and the combination of death and life became apparent in this child’s eyes.\nHe saw the 48 late apprentice miners and understood only a little bit more about what it meant to die.\nHe was 14 years old, but only the idea presented itself, never the reality and experience of it sandwiched between an infinity of layers. The world had never felt so real or surreal.\nHe fell to the earth, remembering thousands of years before being blocked by his age. He was limited, even now, and even if he had experienced a lot, he still hadn’t truly processed things with a mature perspective. That would be gradually bequeathed to him with the passing of time.\nHe nodded with an introspective look.\nHe flew from tip to tip in his mind—a mountain range that provided access to millions of data, items, and information.\nHe fell to the ground, where his hands pounded against the beating of the moment.\nHe engaged in the act of work, not a single drop of fleshy humanity in the scene. He had lost his edge.\nHe was a dull refrain.\nMoving on to a more ambitious note, John Roger stood in front of a large crowd, as he assembled his troops, running away.\nThe goblins were chasing like flies, catching spells and mitigating almost all damage with spells of their own.\nJohn sent out soldiers for them to zone the goblins out, but he intended to making sure that their sacrifices were worth it. He commanded adventurers to look for an ambush.\nThey had overstayed a bit, but they didn’t know that the place was secretly warded, which meant that the goblins could see them.\nThey had gotten caught laying a trap from afar through magical vision in the form of warding.\nAfter they managed to push back and escape, John immediately called for diplomatic negotiations, hoping to truce this away.\nJohn was able to agree on a deal to sell his artifacts with a contract that didn’t allow them or their allies to harm them. This was impossible to invalidate, because any loop holes was ignored by the god who oversaw the agreement between the two parties.\nJohn was confused why the goblins agreed, but he guessed that this was a good time to focus up and get things together.\nThe past events happened quickly and with great precision of impact. From the perspective of an hypothetical outsider, first, a man named Goldberg sat on a tent, observing details around him with his senses on a figurative note. Second, a man named “Matteo” hid from adventurer friends, questioning reality. His friends found him. Third, Goldberg prepared for battle against goblins, reflecting on past experiences fighting them. Fourth, he led an army to attack the goblins but was outwitted and defeated by a shapeshifting goblin named Roots. Fifth, Goldberg and other adventurers were imprisoned by the goblins in a fort town. Sixth, the goblins employed an adventurer named Jashuki to help strategize against the city’s army. Seventh, the goblins launched a decisive attack, using intelligence from Jashuki to ambush and defeat the city’s army. Eighth, the city fell to the goblins. Goldberg pondered the situation. Ninth, a young adult named Billy had an existential experience in the aftermath. Tenth, a boy named Shadrach was promoted by the goblins to a governing position over mining. Eleventh, a young man named Notch tried to adjust to the new goblin-ruled city. Lastly, an noble named John Roger battled the goblins but was forced to negotiate a deal with them.\nThese past events epitomized the experiences of the city in the last month, with John’s negotiation happening on the last week of the second month after Maverick died (AMD)—2 months AMD.\nFalling back to the moment, Billy rode a wagon, riding through the streets of the city.\nThe world had long changed since they first came to mining, and nothing about this world was clear. It was all one big puddle stitched together, with so many people seeking control and power, not a single person really ruling everything, but everyone had felt like they were the center of the world at one point. Billy had his time, and now that was over. Now, he was taking rest in the idle life of the world this city crafted.\nIt was like if someone drew many lines on a piece of paper from random directions again and again until the paper itself was soft-black in color and one could see the lines forming complicated structures, shapes, networks, complexes, ideas, and cities. This abstract art was what the world was like.\nHe noticed a young woman sitting down, wondering what she was up to.\nIn the end, he minded his own business, and her life disappeared like puffs of smoke in his world. She was just a bystander, but to her, her real world was vast enough that if she traveled thousands of miles across it, she would never reach the end. If it was imagination, it would repeat again and again, never able to match reality in its endlessness and nature as a gaping hole. This was the limitation of mundane imagination compared to the grand endless complexities of real life—the wet muddy ground contrasting the heights of vastness.\nNonetheless, she sat down, becoming swallowed by her environment.\nBilly tried his best to maintain himself. The idea to become everything was a common theme among adventurers, so being close with them, he was influenced into pondering that ideal. Individuality reliant on a world of invalidations, categorizations, and polarization only lent to a loss of the self.\nHe tried his best to exist as who he was and not as who his experiences told him to be.\nHe was malleable and changeable yet incorruptible in his undying pursuit of his own self-realization.\nHe was human.\nHe sat down and embraced the ground, his heart pumping blood against the pavement, his soul wrapped with cloth, his skin sweaty with blackened burns. His eyes looked upon the sky, the sky beating him with a metal blunt weapon. His arms reaching out in obedience, the sky commanded him to obey only himself.\nThe metallic taste in his lips pressed upon him to wake up and move on.\nHe stood still, walking gradually faster until he was in a sprint, his feet dangling behind him, his legs stomping against the ground, his arms bolting before his breath, his breath swallowing the air and puffing it out like bellows, his skin eating up air and creating speed.\nHe stopped at an adventurer guild, joining them as one of their own, holding a pickaxe, as he was tasked to mine while the other members of his new adventurer party fought monsters.\nGoldberg did not stand behind him, but Billy was strongly alone.\nHe attacked the rock, casting spells upon it again and again.\nHe didn’t want to remove himself manically from progress, so he cast out spells like a bat screamed in the night.\nHe was trying to create progress.\nHe struck it like a man eating ravenously blessed meat from a holy shrine.\nThe rocks broke down gradually, making gravel. But he was unable to create the finest sand.\nIt didn’t matter though. What mattered was that he was progressing, albeit slowly.\nHe got up and returned to the mining training, finishing the last few days.\nAfter that, he was done.\nHe went down to a cave and kept mining, relying on adventurers to help him.\nHe didn’t know what he was doing, but he was contributing to a larger world.\nGoblins stood in front of him, not as enemies, but as superiors.\nThey told him to match their pace with the rest of their goblin miners, saying that they were so weak they couldn’t match the goblins.\nThey knew that the humans were stronger than they were, but they still felt superior in many other aspects, which made the humans feel like a waste of talent who just used all of that power toward destroying what was right in front of them.\nEarlier, when it came to the goblin takeover, there were other monsters in the region, but none of them agreed to helping the goblins fight the humans, as they felt that the humans had secret weapons, having been so castrated in the past that they couldn’t even recognize the opportunity once the Just attacked.\nThe funny part was that a strong military human force was still outside hunting down goblins. They only realized recently that their human city was already gone.\nFor context, this military force included Nameless and Ethan.\nSimply and truthfully, the goblins only played the advantage, punishing the humans for their significant mistakes. They won fair and square.\nBut as with anything, a simple game of strategy might have won them the fight, but it didn’t guarantee them the long-staying advantage. That had to be fostered, maintained, and cultivated, mitigating the effects of disruption and a lack of experience and skill when it came to handling the human city on the goblins’ part.\nExploring the goblins’ impact on the humans from a heavily abstract angle, human lives were being demarcated and placed into categories, their hearts removed within this operative signature of the goblins—an acknowledgement on their part with regard to how they were treated. Adventurers were moved into various systemic containment “glands,” their various individual characteristics assembled into a more cohesive base of adventurism, one handled via a hundred goblin superiors, each a leader in their own right. One hundred was not the actual number, but more so a representation. As they were called the “Hundred Goblin Titles,” a group meant to represent a show of force on the goblins’ side and a sense of organization usually not attributed to the goblin species. The actual goblin titles were plentiful, but that was not the point. Their goal was to marry intangible elements into clumps as part of an preliminary non-actual process. And in the aftermath of that messier and improvisational multi-system series of exchanges, they would then transport their clumps into a higher-order agency that assigned values and properties to otherwise undeterminable elements. Simply, their goal involved preventing systematic inefficient through learning. In more complex terms, learning how to verify intangible elements within a larger structure rested upon the need to clarify confusions about the weight of imbalances and how they contribute to quality deterioration. In other words, intangible elements, whether they involve organizational culture, team dynamics, or abstract concepts within a system, warrant certification, and clarifying confusions with regard to the overall integrity and weight that imbalances brought to an otherwise stable larger-structural landscape or plateau and with respect the manner in which they played a role in the deterioration of quality in terms of compactness of usefulness would verify these elements. Furthermore, this certification involved a formalized method or system for assessing and validating these larger-structure–abiding elements. To relate this extended conceptualization to more practical terms, these intangible elements related to characteristics such as traditional human culture; secondly, the dissonances often involved in streamlining various affects involved in the significant events that either plagued them or played an ameliorative or enhancing effect upon them; thirdly, the qualities ascribed to various class-meaning–converging (a creating through bringing together) individuals; fourthly, the readiness of the human’s system to adapt to incorporations without too much conflict, which was analogous to the human personality characteristic of openness; and lastly, the highness of economic strangeness in terms how different natural roles played in the hierarchy. When it came to this last of a series of characteristics, “highness” referred to depth while also implying a sense of traditional-level class constraint; “strangeness” referred a more characteristic, functionally formal-methodological form of divergence, often ascribed to the word “strange”; and “natural” precisely referred to how accepted this overall structure equivalency (the weight of accepted ’equal-ness’) was, one that touched upon topics such as the distribution of groups within a society. Exploring this abstraction further, when it came to the weight of imbalances, they referred to the sense of spectrum-like dynamism with points, or more precisely stars, and how they danced, which was why clarifying the confusions regarding them and the manner in which they contributed to quality deterioration. Lastly, with reference to the quality deterioration, to repeat an earlier statement for cohesion, it dealt with compactness of usefulness, basically tying up systematic efficiency as a grounded goal underpinned by underlying concepts.\nMoving into reality, wearing purple and yellow clothes, the Hundred Goblin Titles stretched their legs, their feet traversing across the earth, their limbs propulsive, their arms lean, their posture slick.\nTheir hands operating on each part of their clothes and sliding between pocket to pocket, they moved forward.\nThe hands assembled upon their arms extended forth, arresting the adventurers that thought they could fight while they were arduously present, having been traveling throughout the whole city.\nTheir hands smacked the adventurers, and the goblins fell only to kick them in the stomachs, breaking their drives, sullying their humanities.\nThey clasped them and broke their forms.\nThe adventurers drifted, exploding into ephemeral dust.\nThe goblins struck them and broke them again and again, even after their forms had long gone. The humanity that remained was abruptly swept away with the suddenness of their attacks.\nThey created life through destruction; fixing the weakness present in this society—system absolving through death.\nBut their goal wasn’t to kill. It was only to prevent anyone from taking advantage of each other during a desperate time by murdering brutally those who tried to put themselves as precedents that crime could reign supreme. They were the enforcers of peace.\nThey sought out the adventurers and supported them in the ways of peace by handing them souvenirs of peace—food gifts, desserts, and other forms of pasalubong.\nReturning to Billy, he began cleaning up a little as was expected from him, the metal touch of ores and various materials burrowed into the heart of his wagon. He pushed the wagon forward a little before he placed them on a hand cart that he then carried, his back struggling for a while before he stopped. This was very humanizing even for him.\nHe wanted to use his spells, but they were all offensive. He had given away his mining-adjacent skills to Notch.\nHe kept crushing through the earth.\nIt didn’t seem like much, but he would manage.\nGoblins had pushed him out of the large cave network he helped create.\nSo now he was here, taking care of a new cave.\nThis would take a while.\nMeanwhile, elsewhere, James Boulevard was in a battle with hobbits, accompanied by several dogs he had saved.\nDead hobbit. Check. Sword out of sheath, distractions out. Blood pattered on the grass, a soft drum against the symphony of the screams of war. The cavalry marched ahead, back and forth, like a metronome marking the tempo of the battle. Mountains loomed, shrouded in mist and secrets, dark green against the gray sky. Northe Road, a rainforest jungle nestled in the heart of the Laazg mountains.\nHobbits bustled outside, a kaleidoscope of magic and hurried steps. A hobbit in a bright yellow coat laughed, her voice lost in the wind’s howl. Wagons roared past, their sturdy nailed planks a stark contrast to the vibrant tones of the landscape. Magical structures crowded together, a chaotic mosaic of mana and light, their rooftops hot with fire. The air smelled of death and mud scents, a strange but not unpleasant mix.\nHe struck deep, penetrating flesh. Not a single dent in his sword. The sword barely dulling. Every moment cried for salvation. And his sword’s edges raced down the air, like tiny rivers carving their paths.\nThe hands that used to paint were now wielders of blades, being required more than ever by his fellow adventurers who had escaped the goblins and fled the city. He had to conquer new lands in order to find new homes for his countrymen. The hobbits were only in their way.\nThey stole their homes and entered into their quietest places.\nDisplacement and habitat loss meant trouble on surrounding settlements.\nEventually, he swallowed the flesh of hobbits, hungry after not eating for so long. He needed food for sure, but today was a time of hunger.\nFear and hunger. Check.\nHe sat down, staring at a hobbit, embracing him in spirit, hugging, as the dead face stared into the sky.\nMeadow grass. Check. Sword in, world out. Blood pattered on the grass, a soft drum against the symphony of the battle.\nThe late Charles Finch’s same expression had mirrored the hobbit’s.\nJames cried.\nHe later stood up, his heart too tired.\nHe began slashing the rest of the hobbits away, with an exhausted gait heavier than the load of his equipment and sword.\nAnger lit.\nHe shouted at the top of his lungs: “How dare you make me feel like this! To be helpless! How dare you! You disgusting little fuckers!”\nMeanwhile, back in the city, the marginalized adventurers that used to be shunned by society was now accepted by the goblins, who supported their long-standing hatred of the evil conducted historically by adventurers against sentient monsters. However, when it came to those who had only hated their fellow adventurers because of the exclusive nature of factions and feeling excluded from quests, they were promptly dealt with.\nThough, the newly appointed former adventurers felt awkward and clumsy.\nWhat did this new world mean? Could they really do better than their senior adventurer counterparts? Were they pretentious? They didn’t want to waste this opportunity, but they weren’t completely confident in their ability to replace the older adventurers.\nIn the same heartbeat, in the mines, Billy stared.\nHe fell to the ground.\nThe magical cave fumes was beginning to kill him.\nBilly reached out.\nThe new goblin-controlled city also involved a lot of risk-taking, improvisation, and cutting corners due to limited resources.\nBilly watched the sky.\nHe couldn’t die here.\nHe tried again and again, begging the world to forgive him for his sins.\nHe didn’t know what else to say.\nWho was he speaking to?\nOne of the adventurers he was with sighted him and quickly healed him.\nBilly got up and out back to the surface.\nHe had an outpouring of grief, shock, and tears.\nThis was not heaven.\nHe would keep going though.\nThis new world would struggle under the weight of the consequences of the past.\nSimultaneously, in hell, Maverick laughed again with the Just and Charles Finch.\nReturning to Billy, he got up. He would control this environment.\nHe had to become free from its clutches.\nNature would obey him.\nSociety would hearken unto him.\nIt had to.\nIt had to.\nHe kept smashing rocks and begging it to break.\nHe broke more and more.\nHe made a chamber where he sat down and relaxed, sleeping on the chamber floor.\nThe adventurers came in and had a meal inside, talking with camaraderie, while Billy slept.\nShifting to Billy, he was in a dream.\n“Are you happy, Billy?”\nBilly stared, seeing Maverick.\nMaverick laughed, accompanied by two figures.\nBilly looked around, seeing a hellscape. “Where am I?” he said, getting up from the ground; though, he flinched when his palm struck a spike. He noticed it bleeding before it healed suddenly.\nMaverick said, “Hell.”\nBilly didn’t understand. “How about Notch and Shadrach?”\n“Huh? What happened to you guys?”\nBilly scratched his head. “We drifted apart after the goblins…”\n“What happened?”\nBilly finished his sentence: “The goblins took over the city.”\nMaverick was shocked. “Billy, are you okay?”\nBilly stared.\nMaverick embraced him.\nBilly began to cry, his heart breaking and opening up again, the walls collapsing, the debris clearing. “I don’t know…”\nMaverick wondered why Billy didn’t have parents or anyone else to talk to, but he guessed that Billy was going through a unique situation that even his parents couldn’t comprehend that anything they did only made things worse. So Billy found that his life was just too different and displaced out of what was supposed to be normal.\nMaverick said: “You have to keep going. Press on. Don’t let the pain get to you. The world is watching. Don’t be stuck. Keep finding new ground to cover. Don’t forget what it feels like to live, and if you do, desperately find it again. If you cannot find it, accept the loss and move on and create new gardens. That’s the world we live, Billy. That’s what we gotta do.”\nReturning to reality, Billy woke up, seeing the cold hard ground.\nOne of the adventurers greeted him. They secretly called themselves adventurers, but officially, they were kinatawans. It meant “representatives,” but functionally, they were tasked to guard-dog their interests, such as miner entrants like Billy.\n“How’s your day, bruh?” said Jiji. “I’m pretty much chillin’ out here, hoping to get some work done because I’m pretty much dead. I’m behind by… a lot. Seven quarters… I’m being expected to do that much work. Yeah seriously. They said that it was because of the fact that I used to be an adventurer. I mean, I still am. But still… I don’t know. I’m not really going to do anything. Goblins know that. They detected me, and they said that I am ‘innocuous.’ So that’s a plus. No execution, no death. I’m proud of that, I guess.”\n“Why you yappin’ bruh?” said Redmouth.\n“Ah, whatevs,” said Jiji. “Me no care. Point is we’re going to be handling seven, four, five. I don’t know. But we’re going to be handling a lot of new miners.” He pointed this next statement to Billy. “I heard your friend Shadrach… is going to be visiting.” He returned his focus to the whole group: “He said… My new goblin… superior said that we can kind of just arrange things, kind of set things up, and then hopefully we guarantee, we, we, guarantee, have everything prepared. The goal is that, you know, the adventurers—the miners are completely… comfortable, you know.\n“Right,” said another adventurer, Saturn.\n“So what’s actually going to happen, though?” said Roark.\n“Well, let’s see,” said Jiji. “Supposedly, we’re going to be the ones messing things up and kind of making everything worse. But I don’t agree of course. That’s why they gave us not so much to work with, because they were not expectant of a good result. I hope that things work out, because I’ve, I’ve never really had to kind of set things, the tone, and all of that. Like, if we go to the dungeon and attack the first things that, like, come in our way. I don’t know if I’m going to be able to… handle that, while also trying to make sure that we… have this controf—controllable-comfortable environment. I don’t care to be honest. I do. But if we’re going to make it, I wanna make sure everything’s perfect, and I don’t have to do anything after.”\n“Okay then,” said Roark.\nRoark wielded his spear, his form grandiose, his clothes slick, his fingers spinning the handle with finesse, his steps rumbling like a pack of hounds sighting a lone rabbit.\nThe rest of the adventurers followed. “Either way, we ballin’.”\nTheir gigantic shadows dancing interconnectedly, they slashed giant spiders one by one, a spider in each chamber. The spiders screeched.\nCleaning up the area, they gave Billy and the coming miner entrants a lot of space.\nBut they were exhausted, falling right back to sleep in the chamber Billy had created.\nIn that same room, Billy had a different perspective. He wanted to detach from this world and see it from a different lens. Maverick told him earlier to find new ground, and he wanted to do just that.\nHe decided to leave the city, going outside and encountering the other mining entrants who were scheduled to arrive at the mines. But he said he was only leaving for a while.\nHe kept walking, passing through many familiar placed that were now filled with goblins.\nHe reached the city gates.\nThe goblins stopped him.\nHe couldn’t get out.\nHe had to find a way to leave.\nHe could have left before, but he had wanted to leave until now.\nHe was brought back to the mines.\nThere, he realized that this world neutered him.\nBut no, he couldn’t accept this conclusion.\nHe had to find a way out.\nHe asked the adventurers whom he barely knew back at the mines for help.\n“I want to leave the city,” he said. “How can I do it?”\nThe adventurers smiled and told him that they could help him and that it was very easy.\nThey led him to a tunnel that went across the whole city underground. They called it the “God’s Tunnel” because it led to paradise, or the outside world.\nBilly was able to escape just fine, and all he had to was ask for help.\nNow that he was out of the city, he didn’t know what else to do; however, the adventurers did instruct him to follow the road and run as soon as he heard a loud sharp noise, because beasts were constantly on the prowl.\nIf he was lucky, he would make it. If he wasn’t, he would restart again and again, running back to the beginning to avoid the monsters.\nThe goblin guards didn’t try to stop him because they thought he was from outside anyway. They just warned him not to do anything and allowed him to stand outside the city walls. They used magic to identify the strength of travelers, and they verified that Billy was innocuous.\nBilly kept going, running around. Then, he encountered someone familiar.\nHe saw a large group of humans and goblins, and among them, he sighted Goldberg, who stood, aiding the goblins in marshalling the humans.\nThey were about to raid a giant hole where skeletons and giant mud golems were fighting. It had been this way for hundreds of years, and the group was here to train.\nBilly avoided them for now and came across a traveling wizard, avoiding him as well.\nHe came across a giant with a boy riding on his shoulder. He avoided him.\nHe came across a convoy of carriages, avoiding them.\nHe didn’t want to get entangled with anyone near the city.\nTransitioning to a more relaxed and explorative note, the verdant, rich tones of the jungle with its palm, acacia, banana, papaya, and Premna serratifolia, among others, relaxed Billy. The whole list includes Mango Tree, Banana Tree, Areca Palm, Papaya Tree, Dracaena reflexa, Frangipani, probably dragon tree, Christmas Palm, Premna serratifolia, Broad-leaved Yellowwood, Golden-trumpet, Lantana, Sanchezia oblonga, Weeping fig, Queen’s crape-myrtle, Rottboellia cochinchinensis, white mulberry (no fruit), Chinese-laurel, Monoon longifolium (the false ashoka), Small-leaved dragon tree, Wild frangipani, Fukien-tea, Big-leaf podocarp, Desert wild grape, Darwin black wattle, Beleric myrobalan, Dutchman’s-pipe, probably Leucophyllum frutescens (Texas barometer bush), Golden dewdrops, Ipil-ipil, Abyssinian Rhodes grass, Ficus hispida (Hairy fig), Ficus erecta, Ficus virgata (Figwood), Indian acalypha, Jatropha integerrima (Perigrina), Ivy gourd, Albizia lebbeck, Ixora chinensis (Chinese ixora), Orchid Tree, Neem, Dracaena cambodiana (Cambodian Dragon Tree), Blushing philodendron, Queensland umbrella tree, Okra plant, Cucumber plant, possibly calabash (upo) plant, Tulasi, Red mulberry plant, Guava tree, Tamarind plant or Moringa plant, Great Bindweed, Operculina turpethum plant, Tridax procumbens (Dagad-phul), Muntingia calabura (Calabur-tree), Limnophila rugosa plant, Buffalograss, Ficus ingens, Euphorbia hirta (Asthmaplant), probably Chickenweed, probably Carex pilulifera (Pill sedge), Polyalthia longifolia (Ashoka tree), Averrhoa bilimbi (Bilimbi tree), Mangifera indica (Mango tree), Adonidia merrillii (Manila palm), Dypsis lutescens (Areca palm or Butterfly palm), Ficus sp. (Fig tree - Specific species not identified), Terminalia catappa (Indian almond or Sea almond), Pterocarpus indicus (Narra tree or Amboyna). It also had shrubs or smaller plants: Dracaena fragrans (Corn plant), Costus sp. (Spiral ginger - Specific species not identified), Philodendron sp., Dracaena marginata (Dragon tree), Dracaena reflexa variegata, Polyscias fruticosa (Ming aralia), Dracaena trifasciata (Snake plant or Mother-in-law’s tongue), Asparagus densiflorus ‘Sprengeri’ (Asparagus fern).\nIt was a multifarious landscape, and not all of them were healthy or mature. Many were young and looked nothing like their humongous fruit-bearing mature counterparts, and not every part of the forest was fine. Many dry leaves scattered on the soil, many areas having limited plant growth, one cause of which was human activity.\nHe came to see everyday laborers tending to trees.\nWithin the dipterocarp forest, the laborers engaged in selective logging procedures, going three phases: tree marking, inventory of residual growing stock, and timber stand improvement. To explore this further, the marking was not for felling. They were actually for the ones to be left for the future crop. Basically, the residual future crop, which included a component of young, healthy, well-formed commercial tree species, was selected and marked. There were more details to this, but for the sake of concision, this was a good place to end.\nIt was a magical time to see this because of the 30–45 year felling cycle for each section or compartment of the forest, so Billy watched.\nIn the end, this world—no matter how much his personal perspective at many previous points blinded him—moved on.\nBilly didn’t have grand ambitions he realized.\nHe just wanted to be free from everything.\nMaybe he was too young to think about this, but he really wanted to run away.\nHe wanted to run away from everything.\nHe saw Notch and Shadrach walking over to him.\n“W-why are you guys here?”\nShadrach and Notch smiled. “Let’s go! It was Notch’s idea. I told him that I saw you leaving and had a feeling you were here.”\nBilly smiled. They were just teenagers. Anything went.\nThey ran.\nThe forests sounded an alarm.\nThe world was beginning to close in on itself.\nIt was silent.\nIt would never allow horrors to be allowed.\nBilly, Shadrach, and Notch approached the tyrannical forest, a new place to die; passing by a new road, Broken Road.\nA man wearing a mask saw them in the forest, but he didn’t care. He was the one who had been collecting souls at a previous large battle between adventurers and monsters. He was a spectator during that time and used a portal to escape.\nRight now, he was focused on his relentless goal.\nHe had to stop the beasts from killing the boys.\nHe struck and beat the beasts one by one, leaping tens of meters from spot to spot to make sure not a single beast came unnoticed.\nThe boys moved forward, not knowing the mighty man that saved their lives.\nNot every powerful man only had darkness in his heart. Many still saw the light that shone at the horizon, though coming at the cost of a deep darkness lading their actions, because with great power came the difficulty to see nuance when their unhindered, unlimited actions struck extremely powerfully without compromise.\nThe beasts were necessary for the forest, but the man was killing them all.\nThe forest grew weaker that day.\nBut the Billy, the Shadrach, and the Notch, the kings and queens of this world, human beings who deserved all, were safe.\nUltimately, everything came at the price.\nEventually, Billy, Shadrach, and Notch faced Goldberg and the goblins.\nThe masked man would have brought them, but he would leave them here, minding his own business now that he had killed some beasts. He only needed a few ingredients from the beasts anyway. But he just extended a little effort to help. Now that the boys were caught, he didn’t really care after that. Plus, the goblins and the boys might be on the same side now.\nGoldberg recognized them. “Good morning. You guys are travelers right?”\n“Yeah…” said Billy.\n“That’s right. Are you heading to the city? Why not come with us?”\n“No, we were leaving actually.\nGoldberg was glad the goblins were not listening because he had made sure he moved far away from the group just to engage with a group of older travelers. Plus, the goblins didn’t really care.\nGoldberg nodded, saying that the boys only had to walk past them.\nBilly, Shadrach, and Notch obeyed, passing by the goblins.\nThis time, Goldberg had their back.\nWhen the boys finally passed, they were free.\nThey ran, laughing like children all over again.\nTheir friends and family were back in the city. But those were older friends and family they knew, none of them knowing what it was like to be them. Their emotions and trauma affected them on a daily basis, and no one could help them. Not a single person made them feel valid. Everybody just told them to keep marching on, as if nothing had happened. They expected the usual responsibilities and duties from them, and they tried their best. But soon, they reached their limits and broke.\nThat was why they were here. They wanted to be free from the expectations of a normal life, because they were not normal anymore.\nThe city didn’t feel like a home anymore. It felt like a cage. Maybe, it always had felt like that, and they just realized now. Maybe, this was the truth that set them free. They would finally reach the stars together.\nThe trauma they experienced together bound them together, especially since they were only teenagers, young enough to believe in friendships that lasted forever.\nThough this friendship was built on dreams, maybe that was enough.\nAn aforementioned group of protégés sighted them. As mentioned before, they included a researcher-detective, a skillful pike-maker, a missionary-chaplain, and a well-equipped swordsman-crossbowman.\nThe boys were never truly free from the city’s influences, despite the disruptions the Just and the goblins had brought.\nThe protégés told them to ride on.\nThey each rode magical carpets that floated in mid-air and flew very fast.\nThe boys nodded and rode, still in good cheer.\nTheir destination was a new city, the fourth city from Antipolo City. Basically, three intermediate cities lay between this new city and Antipolo.\nAntipolo was out of the picture, but everyday, it leaked its influences.\nDuring their long travel, the boys saw giant hornless rhinos (Paraceratherium) and other strange humanoid animals with various blends between bats, dogs, cats, and other common animals and humans. Eventually, at the end of their journey, the boys arrived at a small shop where the protégés told them to put on the cheap clothes they bought for them. It was a shop in the middle of nowhere that appeared magically when visitors came, being invisible for the most part.\nWhen the boys put on the clothes, a tinge of nostalgia got them.\nIt was a nostalgia of a thousand experiences, hot days, night walks, and communal experiences. Too many things occupied their mind to the point of making them stare into nowhere with this caught-up glare, like they were being eaten up inside, not a single thought entertaining them with peaceful imaginations. The world was too peaceful and relaxing for them.\nIt was too okay.\nThe beating heart of trauma made the normal seem terrifying, each corner and shadow a terror upon the night.\nThe beautiful sun and sky consistent throughout their memories made them tremble inconspicuously. It was the tranquil moments throughout their lives that left them sweating at the brow. That was why they were scared now.\nThey wished only to be safe.\nBut they could not do anything. They only had to accept that.\nThey regained hope.\nBut the world would not let them lay still.\nIt called them to take up arms and fight!\nGet the hell out of there and move! it said.\nYou dare sit down and lay still!\nMove you brats!\nTime to fight this world amiss!\nGo to hell! And succeed!\nYou must become great warriors of power and strength.\nDon’t let this world claim you! Become great kings and queens upon this land!\nTake them all. Kill all those who oppose you.\nBecome your men!\nBecome your selves!\nBecome unhinderable!\nShut out the voices that say otherwise!\nShifting to the protégés, they didn’t care whether the boys did anything significant. They didn’t expect them to. It was not in their agenda. They just did it as an aside, and it was typical in the culture of this world to care for the elderly, stay with one’s extended family, and extend hospitality even toward strangers. But even if that was the case, they still made a choice to help a group of boys.\nThey would allow the boys to follow them for the meantime, not really losing much to do this.\nThey had hundreds of servants and followers, but they were doing resource collection right now far away in their shared estate.\nThe protégés themselves were traveling and achieving big quests here and there, a routine they had been doing for several years now. It was a monthly thing for them to travel and take on a series of quests all around the region.\nMeanwhile, a tall man stood, accompanied by a group of goblins with a hobgoblin leader, a mimic and two demons, and group of humans. “I am the Destroyer,” he said.\nWhile the group of humans kept poking enemies with long-range skills, the rest of the group made sure to keep their distance from their enemies to avoid getting caught.\nWhen the enemies finally began grabbing the crystals they wanted, the tall man’s group began positioning closer, baiting the enemies to react too early. Even if the enemies had control of the chamber where the crystals were, the tall man’s group still had a chance to steal the crystals. He leapt forward and used a skill that stunned an enemy group of humans.\nHis hobgoblins followed up by barraging them with close-range spells and projectiles.\nThe mimic and two demons joined as well, tanking damage for the hobgoblins and dealing some heavy damage as well.\nThe enemy was wrong to begin taking the crystals in front of the enemies, and they got destroyed one by one. Though, if they began taking the crystals a minute before the tall man’s group saw, they would have gotten away with it and possibly turned on the tall man and destroyed him and his group.\nEven now, forces were working together for common goals.\nThe crystals and spoils were divided evenly among the winners.\nThe tall man soon got word of the movement of adventurers into hobbit territories. The hobbits had helped him and many others, so they were distraught at this revelation, immediately preparing to journey there.\nZooming out to the broader world, even now, it continued to turn and shift with the changes.\nThe adventurers chose a more violent route instead of making peace with the hobbits due to their more violent and controlling nature, especially seen with their behavior toward the miners.\nThe New Adventurers proved that, and even if many people supported the New Adventurers, many new opponents arose like Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair and even Lord John Roger of Trogan to some degree.\nHowever, the goblins supervened, exposing them to various conditions of life, mashing through their dynamics and momentum. Nowadays, Nathaniel maintained his influence with the people by loosening up and spreading out similar to a criminal organization in counter to intense government investigations. In contrast, John Roger was returned to his House of Notadom. Though, now the powers that he held was severely limited and shown rarely if ever to give a show of force that combined both goblin and human forces, giving a sense of officiality in their international image.\nIt was expected for Antipolo to consider an attack during their vulnerable post-Just time, but the previous authorities were sure that the city would be able to withstand a goblin invasion, if given time to heal a bit.\nHowever, the goblins were ruthlessly efficient, something that hadn’t been the case for centuries, breaking the expected time frame by numerous halves.\nIn response, many among the humans were sure someone among the goblins was an influential human commander who colluded with powerful connections all around the region. And it was no secret that goblins were one of the many playing cards of the region, given that they were often reduced to either free XP, monster fodder, slaves, or mercenary status. In fact, the term “mercenary” was too expensive and sophisticated for them most of the time. Even the lowest bracket of humans were not called the same native word if they were slaves compared to goblin slaves. “Mercenary” often came across as a dignified role when compared to how humans treated goblins. That was why the term “adventurers” existed, because the term “mercenary” wasn’t accurate but also because humans left that term for human barbarian tribes or groups. When goblins came in the picture, they were nothing more than a bug. If miners were looked down by adventurers, then goblins even more so. At least the miner-adventurer thing was controversial. The goblin-human thing was not.\nThere was no way just any goblin infestation could reach this far. The same arrogance was felt throughout the entire region, so many cities didn’t care and still thought that it was a hoax or a fake. Goblins were nothing, they said. But that only represented the dominating perspective. In this world, unique individuals played a bigger slice in the picture. This was why the tall man with his diverse group members with goblins, humans, and demons surpassed others.\nReturning to the three boys, Billy was sitting down inside a large guild office, but it was quiet except for the sounds: soft murmurs of conversation, rustling of papers, distant footsteps, occasional coughs and throats clearing, faint hum of the wind through the open windows, rock mining and wood construction outside, and slight rustle of clothing as people moved about. Right now, Billy, Notch, Shadrach, and the protégés were at the edges of their city destination.\nEven wth everything that happened over the last 2 months, it was just the equivalent of Tuesday for everyone present. Naturally, it did have an impact, and even everyday life was affected, leading to people conversing about the past events and being changed culturally as a result, such as an increase in vigilance toward goblins. So the topic of goblins was partially moot in some regular places, but not so much among the higher social classes.\nPolitics played a role here as per usual.\nHowever, it did still feel like everyone was trying to get by, even now. Billy, Notch, and Shadrach still could enjoy themselves though; many novel sights, places, and establishments greeted and waved.\nThe roads here were sloping, adventurous, and much less level because the area was more mountainous, lying along a 50-kilometer ridge.\nEven if Antipolo itself was in a mountainous area, the new city was even more so, overlooking a large lake with a volcano.\nBackn in Antipolo, tens of laborers walked the neighborhood streets, very clearly engaging in construction. Here, the main road were much more cleaner with lots of garden plant stalls thriving.\nSince the soil had volcanically rich, it produced main goods such as pineapple, coffee, banana, cacao, root vegetables, camote, cassava, and cut flowers, among others.\nIts population paled in comparison to Emerald Haven.\nThe thunders of war continued hundreds of kilometers away.\nBilly, Notch, and Shadrach was right to believe in hope, because much could be learned by stepping out.\nBut it was not hope existing in a vacuum. The protégés, the former adventurers, the masked man, and Goldberg helping them was a very good message, and one that showed that even despite everything, the past events still mattered even now. Ironically, Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair was absent recently, but the three boys didn’t fault him for it. They were still young and very forgiving.\nHowever, Billy, Notch, and Shadrach could not comprehend the complexity of their world so much, even if they knew sensually what they experienced. Their knowledge was still lacking much, but as they matured, they would look back and realize the depth of their firsthand accounts of those past events as young teenagers. They didn’t know what went on in Goldberg’s head, Nathaniel’s head, or in the head of any other complex person they had encountered. But that was life for them.\nThey would continue on despite the greatness of the world and how much they didn’t understand about it.\nRelocating focus to a more everyday level, the three boys had varying demeanors and concerns.\nRegarding their demeanors, to begin, Notch wondered if God saw their actions and thought it was bad, eating one of the three apples he procured from one of the protégés.\nSecond, Shadrach scarcely wrote down a list of notes regarding their journey before he disembarked from the magic carpets. He got Notch’s second apple.\nFinally, Billy was the one carrying most of their things, more focused on being the eldest among the three. He kept his gait stable and dominant. He was also eating the last of Notch’s three apple.\nMoving on to some feedback from the protégés, they led the boys down a path that led to a million places. The boys’ meanings would become refined soon enough.\nOverall, the boys’ present dispositions had bearing on their exact future state.\nWhen it came to the boys’ concerns, being 14 years old, Notch, for one, still hadn’t been able to make peace with his parents. “I’m sorry that I let you down,” he told them before he left. “I guess I’m a disappointment.”\nAll these voices in his head got loud. He wished he could shut them out.\nTwo, Shadrach was still 13, so he was still very optimistic, even now. But the trauma affected him, albeit with postponed effect.\nLastly, Billy was still adventurous and curious, still unsure about himself and things. He was 18 years old, so he was stretching himself out of his comfort zone and was the reason why the boys left the city in the first place.\nTheir hands pressed neatly against the ground, the world pressing against them further and further, their eyes glancing at the beautiful sky. Even now, their hearts leapt and whirled like clothes wrapped tightly together in a comfortable forest glade.\nTheir hearts, while tired and broken beyond a sense of belief, found joy in their surroundings and a vegetation nearby.\nMeanwhile, the boys arrived at a garden, led here by the protégés who were curious about it.\nThe garden, while verdant and damp, was an ancient trinket of history insomuch that scholars visited it frequently, with a sense of impunity given their inclinations and the bureaucratic variability of their work.\nIn contrast to the busy-body scholars’ rationale of visiting this place, the protégés were here to pay their interest and respects, as it was a popular landmark here. Though they had seen many times before, they were here to indulge their feelings of nostalgia.\nThe protégés stared at the vastness of the space; looking at the walls that shielded it from the winds and prevented the rain from pouring so heavily upon it through the path of accumulation. Furthermore, the garden was safe-guarded, and the sun fell upon it with care; gardeners strangely making their way hastily throughout the arrangement of the plants like they were in a game requiring speed and rhythm. As for the reason behind this, the plants were magical and strange likewise; requiring sunlight and forms of magic to sustain their incompatabilities with the soil, climate, and magical properties here.\nThe boys were excited, their lips going only through two phases of open excitement and closed wonder.\nConflicting with the pouring relentless embrace of the valley breeze, under the sun, sweat dripped down from the noses and extremities of their faces and the sides of their necks, shoulders, bellies, and legs, hurriedly coating them with a protective layer of freshness in response to the lingering pressure of tropical heat.\nThe love taps of the rain-befriending sun crushed the southwest-heading winds and then made pie out of them, hurling an even stronger rainy monsoon at the peoples of the land amid the sun’s peeking rays.\nEven now, the sky burst forth with water and color, shining the earth with its glorious name.\nNow, seeing this beauty, a fire lit up in Billy’ heart, something that he saw in Goldberg’s eyes—Ambition.\nHe didn’t know what it meant, but he would have to calm it for now.\nThe whispers of the road of ambition raised their wolf heads for the first time, seeing a potential target for their taunts, mockery, and consumption.\nBilly was at that age where ambition began to eat its meals for the first time, having been dormant and listless during childhood. The kind of ambition children felt was more akin to curiosity if anything, but with curiosity satiated came a more involved and intense desire to conquer challenges blocking the natural path.\nIt was about time for him to get conscripted if he wasn’t an essential worker or adventurer already.\nBilly knew beauty when he saw it, and it ate at him that he was not being pressured to excel at his age. He felt that he was not being laden with enough responsibilities for people at his age. He hated being complacent.\nFire burned in his heart.\nHe wished only to become everything—the same wish held by many adults in a time of turmoil and humiliation, contrasting that of the listless, callous ones.\nSpeaking of humiliation, the goblin attack on Antipolo City was described as “the humiliating reminder.”\nAlong with that description, an international coalition of adventurers that had started off as a single coalition in one of the major city-states began to rise to the occasion. They would stomp the goblins and free Antipolo.\nLike revolutions, they poured through the lands, crowding the routes through which the goblins could escape, passing through the “Earthly Territories,” those held predominantly by hobbits. For context, it was there where James Boulevard was snatching homes away from hobbits and the tall guy’s group, with goblins, humans, and demons, was heading to protect them.\nThey struck gold when they found an opening.\nThe goblins might have completed the quest to assaulting and successfully occupying the human state. But they did not prepare for revenge.\nThe humans hated seeing their kind be slaughtered mercilessly.\nA series of human attacks that would become known as the “Freedom Counteroffensive” would begin in 5 days.\nGoblins had thought through their prime offensive well, but they lacked much information with regard to the other human-states. Though they knew that humans had a history of establishing international alliances for reasons such as sharing culture, adventurism, and trade, they were praying that the humans would not retaliate and abandon the state. This was an unintended consequence, one that they did not want to address in drafting.\nHowever, they did begin stocking Antipolo with goblin-fitted weapons, armor, and supplies for the droves of new goblin soldiers that would fully adjust to the new goblin-occupied state in 3 days.\nThey hoped to contradict history which had time and time again spoke of the greatness of human flesh and blood, while speaking disdainfully of the pitiable acts of goblin leaders in their attempt to secure a piece of the regional pie.\nThe sky was the limit.\nMeanwhile, Billy was approached by a recruiter who told him that any and all were allowed to join the coalition. He said Billy’s role would be carrying mana cores. Though, he didn’t mention that it would involve taking care of enemy traps using long, magical sticks.\nBilly looked at Notch and Shadrach, both of whom weren’t given the same invitation. He didn’t want to get swept up in the current situation, and he wanted to stay by his close friends’ side.\nHowever, he remembered an event the time when he was still an apprentice miner. This event involved him and the other apprentice miners at the time fighting each other, and he wondered if they could be a part of a conflict bigger than themselves. He wanted to set an example and show the boys that he as the eldest could do good by the past experiences they shared in light of the frustrations brought about by recent events and the lack of an idealistic culmination of events.\nHe wanted to change things, even now.\nHe accepted the invitation to conquer.\nThe recruiter paved the narrowest path to the light of God.\nDestruction would commence.\nIf Notch and Shadrach chose to leave him, they knew that Billy would die.\nThey had to stay and somehow join the coalition.\nThey asked if they could join.\nThe recruiter declined, saying that they would rather have matured individuals in the ranks than waste 15 years of growth when they could have waited 3 or so more years for the child to mature fully in their time of growth spurt.\nNotch and Shadrach didn’t know what to do, but Billy and the protégés convinced them to let it go and focus on their journey. “Billy is in a different path,” said one of the protégés. “Let him learn and understand the world. Then, we can ask him then what he thinks about all of this.”\n“Just like that, okay?” Billy said a familiar list of phrases characteristic of him. “Just need to completely obliterate everything.\n“I am genuinely going to complete like a frickin’ quest.\n“This is actual adventurer activity, no joke.\n“Rambling on, taking on, fighting on like a soldier or something.\n“That crazy kind.\n“Everybody knows that that’s the best world… in the world.\n“It’s like wonderful, joyous, amazing… Yeah!”\nHe imagined thousand giants looking at him from afar with encouraging gazes.\nHe remembered his wish to become a rich, fat man wearing a top hat and armor with cool clothes, rings on his hand, tiny legs, and a round body shape.\nIn conclusion, Billy’s path diverged from Notch and Shadrach, and the protégés were essential components in this event, with all its subsequent consequences.\nNotch and Shadrach’s worlds were shifting.\nAt one point, they had wanted to rule the world, but their definition of this continued to be incomplete.\nTen hours later, elsewhere, in the Earthly Territories, a man stood, watching over a wide area. “Count the bodies,” he said.\nJames Boulevard—one of the adventurers that represented not only the proxy adventurers of John Roger but also the old adventurers—died at the hands of the tall man’s group.\nNearby, familiar faces became exposed: Elizabeth, Mary, and Sarah.\nDiverging from the everyday level, broadening the perspective, a status reminder of the overall world 73 days since Maverick’s first appearance would help make sense of everything.\nAs for the past events, they included the Marchacha attack—the 48 Apprentice Miners Incident—the Just’s attack, commonly known as “the Great Slaughter”—the goblin attack and occupation on Antipolo City—among others.\nThe living included Billy—Notch—Shadrach—the group of protégés—Goldberg; his wife, Priscilla; his two kids, Nash and Leia; and the representative with him—Nathaniel Lero Sinclair, Catherine Orlov Sinclair, and his two kids—Lord John Roger of Trogan—Sprutnoa—Inframark—the remaining apprentice miners; Ethan, Sophia, Noah, Liam, Alexander, Oliver, Ava, Jackson, Benjamin, and Nathan—Jiji, Redmouth, Saturn, and Roark—Jashuki—the goblins, adventurers, and other people that survived the Antipolo attack and subsequent goblin occupation—the Marchacha goblins—Kahul, the representative of the Marchacha goblins, who was working with Goldberg—Roots—the Hundred Goblin Titles—the Tall Man—Silavush—Divrese—Ariella—Isabella de la Cruz—the former prisoners; Bean, Catherine, Samuel, Joseph, Benjamin, and William—the former 69 other proxy adventurers under John Roger, many of which had gone missing in action or died—the thousand goblins finding a place to establish a settlement—the adventurer party whom Nathaniel had hired to help Shadrach for several days—the miners under Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair—Nathaniel’s adjutants—the adventurers who had gone into Nathaniel’s mine to find the Marchacha goblins—the 47 friends, 20 contacts, and 15 enemies that Nathaniel’s former apprentice miners had made by networking—the masked man—the trolls that had killed lots of adventurers—the young woman that Notch had seen sitting in the street—the various groups the post-Incident apprentice miners had seen in Northe Road; the small boy frustrated with a magical gemstone, the families competing over a ring with magic, and the adventurers discussing casually in separate groups with the wind giving them privacy—the woman who questioned the funding of the calfear’s capture—the officials present during the official event—the older men who had cheered on the adventurers stopping the attack—the girl with fire magic in the school with red and white banners—and the monks who had interacted with the group of protégés—among others.\nThe dead included Millie—Maverick—the Just (Yesami)—48 apprentice miners of Nathaniel Leroy Sinclair—marginalized adventurers who attacked citizens—adventurers who died against the Just—goblin messenger killed by Goldberg—the goblin necromancer and his group—and 30 Adventurers of John Roger killed by the goblin necromancer—Sarah, Elizabeth, and Mary—the adventurers and goblins that died during the goblin-human engagement—the two adventurers who shared a drink with Goldberg after saving him—Charles Finch—Evernight—Saddest—and James Boulevard—among others.\nOther parties included many former or dormant entities: the former King of Antipolo City—the city authorities—the new adventurers—the adventurer guild—the church—the miners—the laborers—the soldiers—and the civilians—among others.\nTouching briefly on a two present moments, first, Goldberg was playing pantintero with kids in a large crowd and playing with cheap artifacts called “Droppers” that created small explosions, the equivalent of a fire cracker.\nThe goblins allowed Goldberg to ease the everyday people with cultural forms of entertainment.\nSecond, Sophia and Ava, who both wore bamboo hats inlaid with metal like Millie, began training together, joining an underground community with many women who used to work as guards. By now, the prevailing priorities, strategies, needs, tactics, and trends had taken on new forms.\nAnyway, Antipolo was not Antipolo right now, but it would continue to diverge with no stops. Soon enough, even people in the streets would dress and put on outfits and attires starkly in contrast to the fashion in the days before Maverick died.\nWith reference to the current socio-political context in Antipolo, it was interesting because the New Adventurers represented both new and old values. It was new in the sense that it represented a shift toward centralization with the removal of proxy adventurers, which many marginalized adventurers and some nobles who openly had proxy adventurers rallied against, but it also advocated for adventurism. As for why marginalized adventurers hated this new movement, they strongly associated centralization with factionalism; contrastingly, factionalism was heavily weakened by the Just attack and the goblin attack and occupation, resulting in an announced need for the government to intervene and set facilities up directly and with limited checks and balances. Though, many scholars would dispute the validity of this correlation between factionalism and the crises, with the characterizations presented, and others cast scrutiny on the possible interpretations behind the announced need for the government to consolidate power. Continuing the main topic of differing viewpoints, many everyday people in Nathaniel’s side opposed the New Adventurers, but they didn’t necessarily advocate for a return to traditional values, because adventurism dominated traditions. What these everyday people did want now was “deadventurification,” or extinction by destruction of adventurism as it was traditionally known to be, bordering arguments to extirpate the state-sponsored role adventurers played altogether, which many would argue that it directly led to the death of adventurism. In conclusion, the New Adventurers, the everyday people represented by Nathaniel, the nobles, and the marginalized adventurers made up different sides, and even within them, various perspectives disputed the nuances and the limitations of each side’s goals. Regarding multi-partisan actionable initiatives, some cross-factionally popular individuals and multi-partisan teams had tried finding a compromise between the sides, but the goblins disrupted everything, taking over the government suddenly. And now, an international human coalition was on its way in just 5 days. Shifting to a broader statement with respect to the effectiveness of knowledge in this pressing period of strife, chaos, conflict, and confusion, and by extension, the effectiveness of this analysis—many was actual, but not everything was communicated fully. In other words, a gigantic discrepancy divided what was actual and what was known.\nThis could be considered an oversimplified scratching-the-surface look into a real situation, and numerous experts would argue that it was very inaccurate and blatantly wrong and misleading. But it would do for now.\nReturning to the present from Notch and Shadrach’s perspectives, they were currently riding a magic carpet together with one of the protégés, heading to another side of their current city—the City of Taktak.\nRelocating into a more vividly descriptive note, the silent throes of earthly shadows dispersed into the atmosphere; breathless noises shuddered about in anticipation of the great feat to be committed by Billy and the other soldiers; a hundred voices leveraged the nightly air and let their voices be heard throughout the prevailing darkness as a show of force; shallow waters tickled the air, precipitation carrying along its usual routine; the loud creaks of doors and papers getting stuck in gaps in desks created an awful sensation of irritating familiarity; the soundless cracks that stretched whenever a man lifted himself out of his sleeping tent and engaged in martial locomotion soared flightlessly into the night, expecting to fall; soldiers hurried about on quick legs, their soles unmitigated by preciously woven footwear and sandals; light clothes embraced their little wrists and shoulders, keeping them close to comfort; nightly gowns were pulled away for the coming human-monster skirmishs expected to transpire; fire burst in the darkness; a sword of light emanated in the darkness; and an former adventurer powerful enough to crash through doors exited a camp and began to swallow the monsters whole with the singeing edge of his glowing blade. But this was just a false alarm. No monster wave here. Only a bunch of beasts that had forgotten their limits.\nThe touch of swords massaged a monster’s nest, as voices scurried about, making their way past the looming bark of trees; questions popped up like savages, quickly assaulting each other and crashing deep into the minds of those who heard.\n“When are we going to war?” was one of the questions, striking deep into the chord of the souls present. It was rhetorical, one used to remind the soldiers of a war so tangible that their brows sweated, their seats began to recoil in frustration, their arms reeled back and toward the farthest door they could find, and their hands tasted blood.\nFormer adventurers who had only seen monsters in their dens had not seen a war as vast as that required in a siege.\nMetaphorically, this was a thousand men and a thousand goblins all at once; as opposed to a few people punching each other on a stage.\nMeanwhile, Notch and Shadrach spotted the camp wherein the soldiers here fought the bunch of beasts, passing through on the magic carpet. Taktak was training soldiers for war, and they were not yet mobilizing at the bridgehead.\nThis was also where the two boys thought Billy was, since they saw him enter a staircase that looked like it led to the training camp.\nSoon, they left; the magic carpets ridden by Notch, Shadrach, and the protégés stopping and creating space between them for the passengers to disembark neatly and in an organized manner.\nIn the distance, they saw the lake. Even without anyone seeing them, the tides (not true ones) swung left and right; who knew where they led?\nNotch adorned a lavender-purple fitted jacket with embroidery depicting human ambition and decorative buttons with adventurer motifs, his hands tightly pressing against his mustard-yellow tight-fitted knee-length trousers, his arms lifted above his head and showing off the shape of his form with the inclusion of a red hand-following and -accentuating cloak that played a discordant role into his overall outfit, stockings paving the path to salvation just by joining his outfit alone. But that was not all to his form and to his character.\nHe held a pickaxe, walking down the path, with magic guiding his steps. The protégés were careful not to let him go alone, so they kept a magical aura protecting him and determining the footing in which he would take, slashing time and constraits off the board. Their goal was organizational, and to process a young boy like Notch, they had to be swift and regulatory. If the time came for him to recognize his power and worth, they would then free him, pouring him out in the world like a vial, and through him, castrate armies where it was needed. But that was not the end of Notch.\nThat was only a latent possibility.\nNotch stood defiantly against the sights of the clouds, the weight of the woodland, and the raging beasts that signed the strench fumes governing his past events in his mind—the sacred art of looking closely became his weapon, supported by the crushing power, Shadrach, whose arms stretched forth in literary volition, creating masterpieces of a few words with just a glance. Shadrach knew the powers that he was gifted, and he would let it go hastily and clumsily to the world. This was their allied power.\nWhen they given a chance to use a pickaxe, Notch struck deep, exhausting the force that rocks held and mightly impinging upon them with his pickaxe stick. He crushed them, breaking them apart, destroying the fabric of their sanity, bulldozing them to sleep, putting a drop of water and scrubbing them off with soap. He pincered (precisely speared) deep.\nDrifting to an emotional level, Notch sat down.\nNot a single emotion touched his heart.\nHe slightly smiled with emptiness in his eyes.\nRegarding his recent psychological history, since the troll attack that left his former 48 co-apprentice miners dead, he would go on the streets and imagine shadows of trolls instead of buildings and imagine passersby with mauled faces, destroyed bodies, and blood bleeding everywhere. The incident never went away, no matter how detached everything felt toward him. He often cried in private, and many had called him sensitive and lazy when he showed signs of depression, not a single person asking him how he felt or how he was doing. They thought he was being rebellious just like the rest of the teenagers his age around him.\nOverall, that was a strong reason why he left Antipolo City.\nExtending this case study to Shadrach, even now, despite using writing as a way to distract himself, never addressed what happened, only pretending and lying. He didn’t address the issues, always hiding and keeping his mind tucked away from them. He only focused on distracting himself and slowly finding beauty in his environment, but a heavy weight pressed against his mind and soul. He was similarly struggling with low spirits, and he felt like the weight of the clouds was upon him.\nAll in all, this was the truth of a horrific incident, something so dramatized, sensationalized, normalized, and desensitized among people who had never experienced it. But they wanted to move past it, like everyone else after the end. Their life didn’t make sense, and the circumstances around their fortunate experiences and unfortunate ones were murky and left to their interpretation. With respect to broader perspectives held culturally within a cosmopolitan landscape, many views gathered recognition. First, if they were grateful to the universe or to God that they survived, then so were those past circumstances a result of good will. Second, if they believed that they were special that they survived, then so were those circumstances a consequence of their special nature. Third, if their good works reaped harvest that they survived, then so were those circumstances an outcome of a yin-and-yang type of karma. Fourth, if they let it go as a byproduct of variability, then so were those circumstances a culmulative reaction to underlying factors, many of which only played a peripheral role. Lastly, if they saw no meaning in this, then it truly didn’t have to matter for now. In a continuative note, they could find that meaning later. Moreover, for now, they could just let it all go, and what that meant was conditional to subjective consideration. Furthermore, their perspectives would grow overtime, and they would learn, growing deeper in their core beliefs or finding new ones onto which to hold. To finish, what mattered now was that they pressed onward, however messy it made them feel.\nElucidating the relationship of the boys with the protégés, the protégés thought of setting up a variety of different places for the boys to enter, placing them inside a very small shop where they could start selling stuff. They thought that it would be good to give them a job where they could begin to recover their pace. The goal was for the boys to relax and take their time.\nThis was easier said than done, because even if the protégés could ask around, they wouldn’t necessarily get a positive answer with regard to taking in the boys and hiring them. In the end, they had to pay their metaphorical tithe in the sense that they had to go by the traditional route and just have the boys join them back at their shared estate.\nThe protégés were not happy with this, because they knew that the other protégés were going to start complaining again. But it was a minor overblown issue.\nThe protégés were just people with their own goals really, and some of them were fine with taking in lost boys. The rest were not.\nNow, the consistent goal among the protégés present with the boys was to keep an eye on the boys for now, so that’s what they did.\nInstead of staying here at this city, they called for another trip. This excited the boys.\nAs soon as they left, it was all fun and games again, as the boys and the protégés played games during their magic carpet drive. The magic carpets only flew a 4-or-so feet in the air, adjusting quickly for slopes, but it couldn’t climb cliffs.\nAs soon as the boys began to feel sleepy some hours later with the drizzle pouring and the cloaks of two of the protégés covering them, the protégés told them to let themselves sleep.\nThey fell asleep and woke up hours later.\nThey weren’t at the city yet, and it was humanly tranquil with only the sound of wind currents, the flapping of their clothes and things, the hushed voices of the protégés as they talked genially, and the weakened glare of the setting sun. Magic mitigated the damage and heat of the sun’s rays.\nThe feeling of the carpet gave them ease; though, it left them worried enough to look around.\nThey passed through gigantic forests with large roads. Beasts and monsters were present, but they couldn’t catch the magic carpets. The trees also protected them from sight. The magic carpets were quiet as well, and the sound of the protégés were magically weakened.\nThis was how different life was for the wealthier protégés compared to numerous people at Antipolo City.\nMoving on to a new stage in their journey, they reached a large spot where hundreds of students were being asked to shoot their first bows. It was a village area, so not all of these people were being tasked with greater purposes in life. But they still tried to make do with what they had. They also received help from someone from the city.\nThe bows were hand-crafted just for them, and the person training the students was a professional.\nThe teacher, Narikatula, gave them time to divide into groups and discuss methods.\nThe discussion would reveal their effectiveness in critical thinking and creativity, but even then, Narikatula emphasized that though good methods were going to get them points, the point of discussion was to give each individual an opportunity to think critically about how to use the bow effectively in combat.\nThe students were joined by Narikatula’s helpers from the city, who offered advice and helped answer questions as a facilitator in these groups.\nThe protégés stood nearby and observed. The fact that they could just do this was crazy.\nThey were going through so many different places and events and just hanging out, especially with the Just attack and the goblin invasion.\nThey were hands-off, and they had the tools and resources to leave quick and stay for months in one place before leaving again.\n“How’s it going everybody? We haven’t had a good show in a long time, but this looks like it’ll be a good one. I haven’t heard of anyone really talking about this.”\nOne of the protégés went forward and opened a portal that poured out a bunch of different rare bows onto the ground. It was trash for him that he could have liquidated easily into some cash. However, he also got XP by giving it to these students.\nThe students and the teacher were astounded, and he was glad.\nThe rest of the protégés minded their business, being very hands-off with each other as well.\nNotch saw the scene through the lens of Antipolo, the many hundreds running about in the goblin attack, the many apprentice miners killed in the troll’s attack, the almost lethal attempt at playing with magic with Goldberg and Millie overseeing them, the walking in the streets with Nathaniel during the Just’s attack. Everything coalesced for this moment.\nHe, along with Shadrach, who had been writing after the apprentice miners were killed by the troll, were children of Antipolo.\nIf they were older, more ambitious, and cynical, a lust for the vial of power would have emerged in their hearts in light of the protégés’ privilege. But they were still young and innocent. Even if they were poor, they only looked up to the protégés.\nHowever, the protégés didn’t want a paternalistic relationship with them. They cared more about promoting self-determination, empowerment, and self-respect in the two boys.\nMoving on to the antithesis of the relationship between the protégés and the two boys, many of the protégés’ peers were more controlling as their parents and culture were with them in their education and upbringing. Overall, higher privilege created higher expectations to excel. Consequently, being expected to excel led to feelings of duty and possibly even a sense of deservedness and entitlement when their duty wasn’t as idealistic as they was told to perceive it, leading to complacency with power. To inquire into this in more general terms, because they were expected to achieve great things, wealthy people might experience entitlement, and so feel like they could do what they want, given that they suffered to get the positions they were prepared for. In contrast, they also experienced a sense of disillusionment when their culminated career didn’t meet the ideals ingrained into them during their formative stages.\nShifting to the peers’ relationship with commoners, the peers often heard the most vilifying reports on events concerning everyday people, leading to enmity with the lower classes. Classism was an adverse mechanism in response to the stresses and expectations upon them by society, especially those of the plebeians who idealized the wealthy life. Factors such as a lack of exposure to everyday experiences and people played a role into this.\nBroadening the scope, wealthy individuals were surrounded by society, concepts, and the abstract, as their position in society was most influential. As a result, marrying these societal ideals, concepts, and abstractions with reality often led to frustrations and disillusionment, leading to enmity. In other words, wealthy individuals were in the most abstract, conceptual, and societally idealistic (by the terms of others, society, and people, not by these individuals themselves) position of influence, thus leading to frustration and disillusionment when these didn’t match cleanly with reality. Comparing two different sides, some of them might want to be normal as a result, and others might accept that they were superior as society perceived them to be, embodying the self-fulfilling prophesy of the stereotypical arrogant and self-serving member of the higher class—leading to behaviors characterized by elitism, exclusivity, and a lack of empathy. It could also be a facade for the insecurities they felt for not matching up with people’s expectations. In conclusion, being able to live a normal life was impossible for these people; thus, each member of the higher class was given an opportunity to cope in their own way and find a path that made sense to them, even if they would never be truly “normal.”\nExploring the concept further, even if wealthy people pretended not to care and chose to “be themselves,” it only reinforced that wealthy man or woman image in the minds of the people. Therefore, they would never escape the bondage of what they were supposed to be and what they were not in actuality—the expectations of a controlling mother (society) seeking a genius musician in a normal child (individuals judged and burdened with expectations solely based on their socioeconomic status at birth). Furthermore, ironically, sometimes, making a normal child into a genius only underscored their incapability as a consequence of their specialization in a single aspect and their confusion and helplessness in every other aspect that a normal balanced upbringing would elucidate to them: throwing everything away for a single system or methodology was not practical at all when seen from a well-rounded glance in an ever-evolving world. Though, this perspective was not shared by all, as many would dispute that “the brief duration of human life and [their] limited powers [were] so far from permitting [them] to aspire to such extensive acquisitions, that excellence even in one department [was] within the reach of few, and those individuals most effectually [promoted] the general process, who concentrate their thoughts on a limited portion of the field of inquiry.” Anyway, well-adjusted wealthy people learned to accept that theirs was the skill set assigned to them and moved forward anyway. Shifting focus to a poetic phrase, “with great power came great responsibility,” not something everyone found easy to accept when it was forced upon them.\nTreading comparatively into a contrasting viewpoint, in an individualistic school of thought, this whole analysis might come off very differently. To explain, many individualistic thinkers would contend that the wealthy were better doing what they felt like doing, even at the cost of common people’s wellbeing, as long as it fostered self-determination, empowerment, and self-respect in each individual, which contrasted with utilitarian or collectivist views.\nRelating the individualistic viewpoint to a broader sphere, the protégés were making intentional effort here, and even if the internal logic of others might seek a limitedly more rational basis for helping others, the internal logic of the protégés merely ended in kindness and a “just felt like it” response. Enlarging this focus, some people fell in love counterintuitively and helped others with no strings attached, except for a sense of fulfillment at doing something good for the world.\nSignificantly, the issue was that life was complex and couldn’t easily be demarcated into red and blue.\nThe complexity of life was also why the two boys were so curious, because they knew that and that nothing made sense intuitively. Hence, everything was counterintuitive, and not every agent was a Rational or omniscient one—with varying knowledge regarding each, differing levels, widely unique considerations, and stubbornly hard-to-incorporate-into-a-model factors. Speaking on a more practical level, arguing for the instantaneous application of extreme measures would result consistently in disruption and unintended consequences.\nIn conclusion, the complexity of life and human decision-making was why the boys and the protégés were equal in being learners.\nReturning to the moment, the protégés and the boys grabbed hands playfully. One of the protégés let Notch hold his hand as a safely cable while leaning backward and even dancing with it and punching it as the protégé kept his arm still, readjusting it every time to catch Notch’s punch. During this, he talked with the other protégés positively about Shadrach, who was surrounded by the other protégés watching him write. Shadrach was proudly explaining to them what he had written. The distance between them shortened, because the protégés were friendly, sociable, and permissive when it came to Notch and Shadrach’s playfulness.\nAfter the students were done with their archery training, the teacher walked up to the protégés, having worn an attractice attire to receive them. Any help that went toward archery and helping people in these unfocused areas was in her best interests. So even now, she abandoned her pride a bit and became that woman.\nThe protégés glanced at her once before turning away, except for the protégé who had given the students the rare bows, who now moved forward to meet her appropriately.\nShe might have taken it that she wasn’t that attractive, but the protégés were just too highbrow in their preoccupation, eschewing the need to satisfy themselves with lecherous gazes at women, though to an extent such that attractive women needed to pay extra regard to how they could attract that highbrow side of them.\nAfter the meet-and-greet between the teacher and the rare-bow–giving protégé was completed, the protégés then received the opportunity to move to the nearby city district that directly led to this village area. She informed of the various provisions of that area, such as several inns, open cafeterias, and libraries. Her words were coated with an energizing quality.\nShe only mentioned the libraries because she knew the protégés could likely connect themselves with people that could give them access to them. She never actually visited a library herself, but she heard very good things about them.\n“The world is a cruel place, it is,” said one of the protégés, Rishamasi, “I imagine everybody knows that, right?”\n“Indeed!” said Croashnalif. “The world has been cruel ever since it was birthed. Like a sunny branch filling up a man’s breasts, it becomes so vile that it almost reeks of dust and deterioration.”\n“Unequivocally!” said Darikadan. “The world is truly unburdened by a needless divisional form of deceit and tearing away. Like summer flies on a morgue, it continues endlessly until it fills up the gauge—eluvie mons est deductus in æquor.”\n“Right!” said Levonstalo. “With that said, we must press on, my brothers and sisters! Let us be the bearer of good news!”\n“Ox,” they said. “Ox” was another Vikiyam term for the word “Okay.” Now, he was a native of “Vikiya,” the nearby city-state, and its adjective form was “Vikiyam.”\nNotch and Shadrach kept their hands grasping their clothes as they pressed forward, following the protégés in their path toward ambition and domination.\nThe teacher bowed, her form lowly, but the protégés prevented her from shaming herself by looking away—a cultural trait.\nThey arrived at the city, their forms divine, as they entered the inn rooms and, except for the two, slept.\nShifting to a metaphorical dissection, the bark ticked like a careful menace roaming about in search of food and water. The light broke through the curtain holes, similar to a red-hatted chief assigning to his young ones orders, curtailing relief for the benefit of coordination. The broken stride of a figure that was attempting to pass through a hallway unnoticed allowed the sun to shine unequivocably, its soundless brass-like shine emanating radiantly like ghosts on a bridge crying holy.\nThe figure was Notch, and behind him ran Shadrach: the boys were in play.\nThey reached a point in the inn where a man dragged a person inside a room, a strange scene reaching their noses. They ignored it for now.\nAs soon as they slept, their hearts woke up to the sound of the same man jumping down the window. They saw the body he dragged and were afraid he would come kill them if he knew they noticed.\nThey hid and avoided attention, looking at the door that led to the hallway that led to the doors of the inn rooms where the protégés were sleeping.\nThey could not do a thing but let the night take its close; the morning soon arose.\nThey had fallen asleep, and when they woke up, their hearts were quick-spun again like a man-puppet being dragged along a stage.\nThey stood up and put their tender feet on the floor, exiting through the carefully opened door. The sun was bright, shining through the open windows, reminiscent of the window through which the man had jumped down. Their kept their gazes down, as if their heads were covered at the sides and top with three hands. They left the place alongside the protégés, unaware of the man’s absence. It scared them to think he was still there.\nThis was the city.\nThe quiet noises bit softly onto the streets, elevating the sense of bustling with its bright flashes of magical gleam; every sign indicated that this was a rainforest street.\nThe boys were prepared, tucked next to the protégés, their hands unaware of where they put them and resting at the teeth, which bit incessantly like a rabbit, afraid knowing that the man could be there any second.\nThe light shone brightly over the buildings and trees, the shadows filling the space below the canopies, giving the morning a cold kiss.\nThe boys were excited at the prospect of turning away from this stop of this journey, hoping to get away from the man. They told the protégés, but the protégés didn’t know what to do except tell the guard about it. They didn’t react too hastily or intensely, not wanting to scare the kids.\nThe light continued to shine, its glare at the boys persistent, as if it knew whence they came.\nThe boys readily eshewed it, telling it to back off, not wanting to let the cohesive nature of the light overtake them and crush them.\nThey drifted away, returning to the village area where the woman was.\nThe teacher stared at them, being accompanied by one of the protégés, who was a woman. The morning was kind to them, giving them fresh drinks and dinner to eat.\nIt was like being appreciated by a god.\nThe boys played with this idea of hope.\nRandom sounds sauntered with them.\nThe bow archery training was quick like butter over a hot day, the buttery sensual taste of sweat reached all over the students’ bodies, engaging them in the spirit of friendship, for in a sense of togetherness within suffering there abounded opportunity for camaraderie growth.\nReturning to a grounded nature, the boys listened well to the discussions, participating as if he was a child of the students, for many of the students were parents.\nThe protégés were unallowed to join because they were loud and boisterous, but the teacher didn’t fault them for it nor did she tell them that they were not allowed to listen anyway. But she did emphasize the need for silence throughout the training session.\nThe boys were quiet little baby warty pigs, their little feet dangling back and forth underneath their stool chair. The lonesome dirt was given newness by their bare feet and those of the students, protégés, and the teacher.\nAs soon as the training ended, everyone was happy, their smiles reaching their ears. None were upset, and that gave room for the two boys to look past their past circumstances and gain life in the moment, even if it might feel too relaxing and tranquil.\nThe sun kept them in suspense, always reminding them of the possibility of death, so they were fine.\nThe boys weren’t made to fight or train. Instead, they experienced what it was like on the side lines. They would soon grow up, so now was a time of exploration and first-time experience. If they were plunged into a hellscape, that would be horrible. So this was a good time for them to be themselves and kids again, after everything they had gone through.\nMoving on to a more physical nature, the back and sides of the boys’ wrists and hands became wet, as they wiped the sweat off their foreheads, their head, their neck, and the sides of their body. The sweat reached inside their clothes, and they soon began removing them, the moment like a prickly sharp focused embrace. The sweat was very soothing, yet it was very hot.\nThe protégés assured them that they could take a cold shower.\nThe boys were excited at the idea.\nLater, one of the protégés, a giant muscly man, immediately grabbed a tree and removed them, using magic to plant it somewhere with the roots integrated cleanly, with only the ground where the tree originally was left bare and messy. It was just a message that he was the one a watching goblin had to send the food to.\nThe goblin walked up to him, and he handed it wrapped sweet rice cake.\nThe giant protégé shared it with the the protégés. “Mmm! This is so good! Thanks!” In reality, they were just normal people who spoke like everyone else. Their formal, sophisticated language earlier was more so just them joking with each other; though, they did come from formally educated backgrounds.\n“What’s that?” asked the protégés walking up.\n“Biko, want some?” the giant protégé said.\nThe protégés began to feast like wolves.\nThey also saved some for the boys to eat later.\n“Oooh, that’s really good, doesn’t it?” said one of the protégés when he saw one of the protégés getting rice stuck to their face.\nThe protégés laughed together in response.\nWhen they returned to the boys, the boys were lying on the grass under the shade of the rainforest trees and surrounded by tropical vegetation.\n“How are you guys doing?” said one of the protégés.\n“Fine,” Notch and Shadrach drawled.\nThe protégés laughed again.\n"
