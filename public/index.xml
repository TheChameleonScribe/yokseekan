      <description>The book cover presents a vibrant scene reminiscent of a classic role-playing game. A charming, red-roofed building, likely an inn or shop, sits atop a floating island with a pathway leading down to a lower level. Several characters, including a young woman with red attire, populate the scene. Red triangles with exclamation points hover above the characters, suggesting alerts or warnings within the game&amp;rsquo;s context. In the bottom left corner, a red goblin icon with the text &amp;ldquo;x3&amp;rdquo; indicates a potential threat or enemy encounter.</description>

      <description>Chapter 1 - Laborer link Author&amp;rsquo;s Note&#xA;Stay and rest awhile. This is going to be a long ride. I may fine-tune published chapters as I go, but the main idea is there: how limited one narration is yet how wide everyday actions influence society. I am narratively restoring the power back to the people by emphasizing how much power an individual holds amid war and terror. It&amp;rsquo;s third person omniscient point of view, so be warned.</description>
